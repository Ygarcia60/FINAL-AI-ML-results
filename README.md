# AI/ML Projects

This repository contains a collection of my work in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Each project focuses on applying core ML techniques to real-world datasets using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Overview
These projects demonstrate skills in:
- Data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization
- Model training, evaluation, and optimization
- Working with libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib

  ## ðŸ“Š Dataset

This project uses a manually labeled Airbnb Reviews dataset to train and evaluate sentiment classification models.  
Due to GitHubâ€™s file size limits, the dataset is hosted externally.

**Details:**
- Contains user-generated Airbnb reviews with manually annotated sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral)
- Used for supervised training and performance benchmarking
- Cleaned and preprocessed in Jupyter Notebook before modeling
