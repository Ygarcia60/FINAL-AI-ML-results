Alex's home is truly a sanctuary.  Fantastic mountain views from both outdoor balconies.  We enjoyed our stay in Topanga and hope to return soon.  ,location
"Beautiful house, beautiful location and Alex was a great host! Very relaxed and easy vacation for us - highly recommend :)",location
"We  had a fantastic stay at Alex's Topanga Sanctuary!  The house has an upstairs main house, with a king and full size bed, a downstairs apartment and a cottage at the bottom of the property with picturesque views and hiking trail access.  The house was fully equipped and Alex is super helpful...he even arranged for us to have a massage (Taka is awesome)!   Many thanks to Alex, and we hope to see you again.",location
"Alex was a great, responsive host with a wonderful home.<br/><br/>I would recommend to anyone! ",host
Alex was a very gracious host! WOW! What a beautiful being of pure love. He wears his sincerity on his sleeve. His home was very well kept... A true sanctuary. It's like walking into a sacred temple with nature abounding in every direction! ,clean
"Loved staying and this house! The home was comfy and welcoming! Michelle and Barry had all the basics waiting their for us, including a welcome tray with wine and snacks. The decor was perfect and the outdoor space was fabulous! The hosts were very helpful and easy to communicate with. It was a great spot and we didn't want to leave! I will definitely be back to this house! Absolutely loved it! I'd recommend it to anyone staying in LA and the Echo Park/Silverlake area is one of my favorites! So much to do near this house! ",location
We had a very nice stay. The place was both clean and cosy with a lovely terrace. And it was so nice to arrive after a long journey to food in the fridge. I can recommend the place.,clean
"Great location. Very clean cute little cottage. Many extras from fully stocked kitchen, shampoo conditioner, washer dyer to use and great welcome basket. Would recommend this listing",clean
We had a great stay at Michelle and Barrys guest house.  It's a lovely bungalow with all the things you can wish for and more. Amazing  atmosphere and Michelle & Barry are very helpful and friendly. Would definitely want to come back here! ,location
Highly recommended! Host was super friendly and available. The lovely cottage was the perfect size and the patio/yard was peaceful and relaxing. Convenient location - we especially enjoyed all of the vegan restaurants in the area!,location
"Our Memorial Day weekend was delightful at this lovely home. Alexander is a wonderfully accommodating host. His love of the land, and his personal touches in his home are very impressive. We enjoyed our time both outside and inside. The tour he gave us of the property was particularly impressive.<br/>This is a place we would like to bring the whole family.<br/>Thank you Alexander!",location
"The accommodations, service, and experience were excellent. Topanga is quite beautiful and this home surrounded by natural beauty and pristine views, reflects that. Airbnb at its best!",location
Alex welcomed us graciously in his unique and stunning home that sits on top of a huge boulder with views out every window of the Santa Monica mountains . The decor fits the sacredness of the land the house is on. It's truly a sanctuary and resting place that feels like another world. The is a very special place that we had the good fortune of discovering. ,location
We had a great time here! I am sure it would be great to meet Alexander in person.,location
"Alexander is a fabulous host, very flexible, excellent communication. It's a very nice person!<br/>The place is magical with plenty of surprises: the surrounding nature, the birds, lemon and orange trees, beautiful objects inside and (Website hidden by Airbnb) much to say.<br/>I recommend this place to anyone who like mystical vibes and silence. <br/>The only minus is the road...you better be a good driver!<br/>Location is very good: 34 minutes to Santa Monica, 15 minutes to grocery stores (Woodlands). I encourage everyone to visit Topanga: wonderful shopping !<br/>We will definitely come back as soon as we can.<br/>",location
Alex was a great host.  The view was amazing and we really enjoyed our relaxing stay.,location
"Fantastic peaceful getaway with convenient local shops, hiking and access to the beach. Some may not like the twisty drive up the canyon and to the property but didn't bother me a bit. If you are looking for somewhere with a good vibe  to relax away from the hustle and bustle this is it.  Host was responsive and helpful. Hope to return someday!",location
Beautiful views of the canyon!,location
"Alexander's home is a peaceful serene space. It is very quiet, surrounded by greenery and with beautiful views of the canyons. The house is spacious with every thing you would need to be comfortable, including a well equipped kitchen. The fire place was perfect for the chilly December nights! Topanga town itself is a hidden gem, wonderful restaurants, cafes and shops and only 10 mins from the beach. My husband, dog and I thoroughly enjoyed a relaxing city escape and would highly recommend to anyone looking to unwind.<br/><br/>Just to add - It is easy to find following (Hidden by Airbnb) maps and the road is paved, steep and windy yes, but if you go slow and use the mirrors you'll be fine!",location
Perfect space for my solo getaway. Stunning views. Close to hiking. Alexander was always just a text away when I had questions. He was very responsive and helpful. I would recommend this space to anyone looking for a peaceful getaway.,location
Four of us stayed here for 3 nights.<br/>It's a compact but but charming place with amazing views. The decks are an amazing place to sit and just enjoy the environment.<br/>Alexander is a great host. The place was absolutely clean and had just the right touches.<br/>We had a great time.,location
"Alexâs place is so awesome! The descriptions are very accurate. Heâs communicative and very helpful. I enjoyed all of the views, of which there are many. We watched the sunrise on one deck, and stared at the moon on the other! This place would be great for a meditative getaway (which we did), romantic stay for a couple, and also small groups of friends. We both appreciated the art, crystals, statues, singing bowls, record player, and all of the other awesome touches. Alexâs place has a great energy, and I left feeling like a better me :)",location
Such a lovely home and host!,location
Alexâs House was in a great setting in Topanga very close to hiking trails with two large decks in a natural setting.  He was very responsive to questions and requests and was there to welcome and help settle in.,location
"a really peaceful and beautiful location in the hills of Topanga canyon.  access is up a steep, winding road with poor visibility, narrow lanes and some one-lane sections with traffic in both directions.  owner was very communicative and responsive whenever we contacted him.",location
Alex's place is incredible- It has a wonderful energy and is nestled away in nature with a fantastic view. Alex was a great host. Communication and check-in was easy. We can't wait to stay in this sacred space again!,location
Beautiful secluded spot to enjoy the mountain view and sunshine from the decks!  Easy access to Malibu and City down Topanga Cyn.  Alexander is a kind and welcoming host.  We could not have had a better LA experience.,location
"Everything was great. Nice, clean room w/ private bathroom. Access to the kitchen and laundry area. <br/>Rose did a great job as a host, waiting for me as I arrived the first night, giving me directions to close by restaurants and grocery stores. <br/>For sure I recommend it and stay again if I needed to go back to Monrovia. ",clean
"Rose is an amazing person and greets you with a big smile. She is a super host.  The room was comfortable, everything was nice and clean.   All of us living in this place used to hangout, have fun and do amazing things over the weekends. It was amazing to see the warmth  everyone else  had.  Rose had this amazing collection of tea that we used try every other evening.<br/><br/>It was a memorable stay. I am definitely going to  visit again.",clean
"Excellent Host, a team of daughter/Father with 2-3 properties, they will accommodate any price point and will help you every day or leave you alone every day, whatever you prefer. AMAZING REPRESENTATION OF AIRBNB!!",host
"BEST AREA OF LA )( BEST HOST IN LA. I have stayed in a few places near by and NOTHING compares to Rose and her properties, best location of LA hands down! will be staying with them again!<br/>",location
"Rosemary is super sweet and very helpful; she'll give you lots of recommendations for places to eat or visit or anything. From the best burgers in town to what's new and hopping--she knows what's going on. Monrovia is a great place to be for people who are ready for something bigger than a small town, but not as big as a city. Everyone here is very friendly, and the home is very comfortable and welcoming. Although it's on a bit of a busy street, I actually do not find the cars to be especially bothersome. In fact, I don't even notice them; it's surprisingly quiet.",location
"Rosemary was a great host, she was very communicative, friendly and became a great friend after my stay with her. She cares for her guest, her house is beautiful and I loved her dog Honey! Very clean, a lot of privacy, I felt very safe!",clean
"Rosemary is a beautiful person and her home was the perfect transitional housing when I moved from NY to LA. The location is convenient to wonderful shops, eateries and best of all, it is peaceful. I loved it all. ",location
It was wonderful coming back to Rosemary's place.  Clean comfortable with great professional women. ,clean
Would definitely stay again. Best long term airbnb stay by far. I really loved that every guest was long term. It made it much more comfortable. The experience is closer to an apartment then an actual airbnb. That being said remember to bring your own supplies. Not to say that the house doesnt come with a few things but you will find items lacking. ,location
Rosemary's house was very comfortable. I've never lived with other people before and I thought I would hate it but I didn't experience any problems. The room I had was big and the house was quiet. Rosemary made sure I had everything that I needed. And she is very nice. ,clean
Rosemary was very friendly and interesting to chat with.<br/>She made me feel very welcome and returned communication quite quickly. Unfortunately there were quite a few issues with things not working during my stay which kept her busy finding remedies for. Overall my stay was comfortable.<br/>,clean
"Clean, everything works, good kitchen , nice laundry machine <br/>All signs point to super great",clean
"I stayed at Rosemaryâs place for a couple months and it was great. The house was clean and my room was spacious and had a huge closet. The bathroom is shared with a couple other guests, but I never really ran into them. There are plenty of cooking utensils, pans, etc. in the kitchen. Rosemary is great and responded to my messages immediately.",clean
"Overall a great place to stay in Monrovia!  Rosemary is super nice and hospitable, never had any issues with roommates. Thereâs also a bunch of shops and restaurants in walking distance and the lyft rides are only 50 cents around the town.",clean
"My stay at Rosemary's was really good.  I enjoyed my stay and would highly recommend it.        It is centrally located in Monrovia and easily accessible to shopping areas, restaurants and entertainment.  It is a lovely, spacious, clean home for women-only which makes it that much more comfortable.   It accommodates 5 women.  Although other women stay there, it was not a problem at all.  I could comfortably launder my clothes, use the kitchen, and the bathroom with no inconvenience at all.  The room itself was spacious and the bed was comfortable.  Rosemary is quick to respond to any issues that would arise.  My only complaint is that there were no locks on the doors of 4 of the 5 rooms.  Every time I would leave, it was something I was concerned about.  Although everyone was nice, it would have added to my level of security.  Nevertheless, I would stay again.",clean
"Thanks to Rosemary for hosting me in this beautiful place. The house is beautiful , the host is lovely, always caring. The women in the house are nice. Monrovia is a beautiful city !!!! I absolutely recommend this host who s asking if everything is okay.â¥ï¸â¥ï¸â¥ï¸â¥ï¸",host
A great place to stay when visiting the greater Los Angeles area. I am happy in every way about the accommodations.,location
The host Rosemary was very hospitable and the house located in a lovely area Monrovia.<br/>There was lots of plants in the garden of the house  and I also enjoyed garden area.<br/> The room I was staying was very spacious and  serene. I had bit miscommunication with some of roommate while sharing common areas but Rosemary was helpful to resolve the issues.,location
"This home was perfect for my transition to California from out of state; the location was great (beautiful view of mountains and hiking close by), and the host was so quick to answer any questions and help with whatever I needed - which I really appreciated being from out of state.",location
Had a great stay here. My stay lasted a month and I felt comfortable the whole time. Place was clean and felt like I had my own space to get things done here. Would recommend.,clean
"The house is quiet, clean, and spacious. There is a beautiful garden in front and in back. Western bluebirds and other birds were flying around. Lots of butterflies and bees too. Rosemary was a great host. She taught me a lot about the plants in her yard. She was very attentive to my needs and check-in was a breeze.",clean
Rosemary is the sweetest host. Gave me suggestion on where to eat since it was my first time in Monrovia. Would come back and stay with her because itâs a safe area and not that far from everything. My only thing is that if youâre not a fan of bugs donât stay here because there were ants since we were close to the mountains.,host
"This was my second time staying at Rosemaryâs! As always it was a great place to stay for an extended amount of time. Great location, great neighborhood, and Rosemary is great with communication and making sure your well situated.",location
Rosemary is a great host. Her place is comfortable and cozy. Her communication is always immediate. If you are lucky Kiwi will come by and say hello to you (the dog). You will enjoy your stay.,host
"Rosemaryâs is amazing. Great place for working professional women who need a quiet place to relax after a long day of work. I enjoy Rosemary and being in her company. She is kind, smart, and accommodating. She has made my transition to California as seamless as possible. Whenever Iâm in Monrovia this is where I will be. I didnât have any issues doing my laundry or making my food after work. Feels like home.",location
"Michelle and Barry were very helpful hosts. <br/><br/>We arrived to the house which was beautifully stocked with some essentials to our surprise. <br/><br/>We didn't get to meet Barry but Michelle was such a gem and was really helpful with our questions. <br/>They made our stay very pleasant and the house was in a really good location- walking distance to awesome shops, bars and parks. <br/><br/>Our first time in LA and we are so thankful to Michelle and Barry for making it such an wonderful experience. <br/><br/>Thank you",location
"Michelle and Barry were great hosts!  They responded immediately to my initial inquiry and provided very thorough check-in instructions in advance of our trip.  Even though they were out of town for part of our stay, Michelle continued to be available to answer any questions we had and also accommodated our request for an early check in.  <br/><br/>The happy cottage has so much charm and character.  It's also well stocked for anything a traveler could need. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and particularly loved the patio/garden area.   Many thanks  Michelle and Barry!!",location
"From the moment I booked, this was a great experience. Communications were always prompt and friendly. The house was fantastic! When I arrived there was a lovely welcome pack of goodies, such a nice touch.  The icy cold drinks in the fridge were a welcome relief from the heat - these touches make Michelle & Barry the perfect Air BnB hosts. The house itself was lovely. An older style home with nice renovations that make it a comfortable retreat after running around LA for the day. There's a nice outdoor area to relax in as well. For explorers there are plenty of good restaurants and cafes within easy walking distance. When I revisit LA I hope to be able to stay at Michelle & Barry's place again - I know that it made my trip to LA all the more special!",location
"Michelle and Barry did an excellent job making us feel welcome. Everything was a described and the neighborhood was wonderfully walkable. We appreciated the welcome basket and clear annotated instructions in the book. I loved the front porch area and the little dinner nook by the grill. Walking to the guesthouse was like stumbling into a secret garden. Michelle and Barry were very responsive to texts, as needed which wasn't very often. 3 of us fit very comfortably. I enjoyed all the little touches used to make the decor feel like home. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to be central to downtown, the beach, hollywood, and all the beauty that lives north of the city. ",location
"Barry and Michelle were great hosts, we enjoyed our stay very much and their hospitality. They paid attention to every detail including a very nice welcome basket. The location was ideal and close to everything in L.A. We would definitely come back!",location
"Wow! This place is amazing! The pictures do not do it justice. It looks smaller in pictures but it's much bigger in real life.  It's very private, well decorated, clean, and just fantastic! Michelle and Barry are great hosts and very sweet. They provided things like clean drinking water, snacks, and even a bottle of wine. This was my first time doing Airbnb and I could not be happier. My trip to LA was magnificent and this adorable place will always be part of those memories!",clean
"The house is comfortable and very nice.Michelle and Barry prepared everything for us. The instruction is very helpful, we follow it and have a wonderful time here. ",clean
"The listing was as advertised, and Michelle and Barry were nothing but welcoming. We had a very pleasant stay.",clean
10 stars! What a wonderful experience. Our hosts were super thoughtful and exceptionally cool. The house was amazing and easy to find. We felt super Zen with all the Buddhas around. I can't say enough good things. Book this bnb NOW!,location
"A fantastic AirBnB experience.  Lots of room (4 people no problem, 3 couples could fit.)  Michelle and Barry are great communicators and have thought of literally everything.  Exactly as described, very clean and in every possible way recommended. Thank you Barry and Michelle! and Grimm. :)",clean
"<br/>This was great; food was present in the refrigerator; a welcoming tray, there was bread; it really made us feel welcomed;overall they were spectacular hosts",clean
"Although I did not have a chance to meet the hosts, Michelle was very friendly and responsive to my messages - great communication. The place is big with a great outdoor seating area. They had a welcome basket of snacks and a bottle of wine, and some eggs and milk and bread in the kitchen, which was very kind. I REALLY appreciated the 5-gallon water jug because I dislike LA tap water and was a great help. The guest house is old so it was chilly but there are heaters in the bedroom and living room, and the extra blanket from the futon made it all manageable. TV was great, wifi was a bit spotty but also fine. The check-in/check-out process was very easy. Parking was almost always easy to find but we did have some trouble at 10pm on a Saturday night (maybe just got unlucky!), so don't be afraid to check out the surrounding streets. I appreciated the note in the description about the possibility of there being a party, but the noise was pretty manageable. Overall this Airbnb was very accommodating, spacious and accurately described. Thank you!",clean
"Michelle and Barry were exceptional hosts, even offering to heat the place one night for us before we got back.  I seriously considered a permanent move - their set-up was sublime.  We were welcomed into their cozy, spacious, and very clean home, with a basket of goodies (popcorn, wine, fresh fruit, an avocado, etc) as well as a very thorough and comprehensive welcome book.  When we got to the fully-stocked kitchen, we noticed another basket of goodies (organic jam, banana, fresh bread, hazelnut spread) AND fresh milk and eggs (AND 2 beers) in the refrigerator.  This darling home was better stocked than my own kitchen!  <br/><br/>The futon bed was very comfortable, as was the bed in the bedroom.  The heater in the restroom was very useful during the cold spell.  <br/><br/>We didn't make use of the back patio for a romantic dinner/cute lunch but I imagine it to be a great place to dine or just read.  Thank you so much for an amazing stay!",clean
"Matt was great from the get go.  He made me feel welcome instantly and bent over backwards to make sure I had everything from satin sheets to fluffy towels to feeling at home right away.  He also turned out to be a really nice guy, caring and sharing, and funny. The room is comfy and has plenty of closet space and dresser drawers, and bright windows on two sides, plus a desk and several chairs.  The area has all the conveniences and restaurants one needs and really is 30 minutes from anywhere in LA by car, with public transportation easily accessible also.  The pool is a nice addition (as is the Entertainment Room he has for rent) and the roommate, Mark, is a cool and pleasant and interesting additive.  It is a real pleasure staying here and Matt constantly does his best to make guests feel comfortable.  Unless you had to stay in the heart of Hollywood/LA, I couldn't recommend this more, and a lot of that has to do with Matt's approach to ensuring guests are comfortable from the very beginning.",location
What a gem! Lovely hideaway in the mountains.,location
Magical spot in Topanga. Alexander was the best host ! Would stay again anytime !,location
Beautiful place and lovely hosts!,location
Beautiful place. Definitely a gem!,location
"Alexander's place here in Topanga is magnificent. You will enjoy your stay and may never want to leave. His home is warm and inviting. You will enjoy looking at his lovely landscape and looking at all his treasures he has collected. while traveling. You will get an authentic taste of Topanga.<br/> Get out and enjoy the trails, good food, sights and serenity.",location
The location and the surrounding nature is very beautiful! Would definitely recommend renting this place!,location
This place is a great introduction to beautiful Topanga. Stunning views and an exceptional host. Highly recommend it.,location
"If youâre looking to get away from it all,  just not too far, Topanga is a wonderful place to visit. Youâll be high up in the mountains, but still only a 15 minute drive from the ocean. The house is lovely. Plenty of space, personal, two large decks with views, and just a great place to hang out. I stayed for two weeks and did a lot of cooking, loved it that the kitchen had everything I needed. The host, Alexander, is super nice and easy to communicate with. Overall, an awesome place that I highly recommend!",location
"This listing was extremely misleading. We frequently rent Airbnbâs for our employees all over the country. Upon arrival there were other guests staying in other parts of the same house and other people on the property seemingly. Nothing was very clear. I was told it was per friendly but the host called Airbnb and tried to have us leave after one day because the dog that travels with my crew was barking too much and disturbing people. Well i thought i rented an âentire placeâ. We worked that out and then he sent me a video where you hear a small dog who is 15 btw, let out a bark maybe twice in 3 minutes - he said it was bothering other guests- he didnât realize the dog would be left alone while we were out. And basically the host was on the property tending to a pile of old things outside that he needed to sort out. There was no real light in the place - only pink and blue lights. The bedroom has zero lights and we had to bring in a utility light from one of our jobs to see. The house is so secluded on the top of a mountain that once we were back at the house from work there was no leaving until the next day.  My employees who travel for us often said it was the worst experience they have ever had at an Airbnb. And ended up leaving two days early and getting their own hotel rooms because of our uncomfortable they were. This house is basically for someone who wants to live on a commune and hang out with the host.",location
attention! deceit. The house does not match the image in the photo! Divided into rooms and handed over in parts! I refused to check in for two weeks trying to get my money back. The owner doesn't get in touch!,clean
"The house was in bad conditions. There was no cleaning and the host didnât take care about it. We know it was in the mountain and dust is a part of the environment but these was a bad experience. We only stayed one night of the 15 we had booked. And the major problem was a gas leak, when i phoned him for help, he refused to come. And told me HE will cancel the trip. We packed and got ready , he did not come , he did not cancel. Quite the opposite he wrote in the app. On of the worst traveling experience of my life. Dont go there",host
"This place had amazing space and views, good vibes, fruit trees, a big bed, a spiral staircase, probably over 100 succulents and various plants, two decks, a snake (although that was his daughter's and probably won't be there every time), parking, a crazy-windy drive up to the house, and a lovely host. We will try to return as quickly as we can :)",location
"My stay with Alexander was perfect. And he was always communicative and respectful of my privacy. <br/><br/>The place has breathtaking views, you are surrounded by nature and plants and makes  for a great place to work from home and also get some quality sleep. <br/><br/>If you are not familiar with Topanga canyon I would suggest arriving during the day as the first time getting there at night could be a little tricky (only if you have never done it before) <br/><br/>The fireplace and music sets the mood and tone for the week and made it feel so relaxing. I wish I could have stayed longer and would def stay again.",location
"Phenomenal stay. Alex is an incredible guy, the home is full of gorgeous art, plants, eclectic decor which make you feel like youâre on a retreat away from the noise of LA. If Iâm ever back in the area Iâll definitely stay here again.",location
"This was our first airbnb experience and the stay at Michelle and Barry's cottage far exceeded our expectations. Their communication was great. We had many questions and they thoroughly answered them all. We really appreciated the welcome basket they left for us. We're vegan and it's hard to find vegan friendly places to stay. They were very thoughtful making sure that everything in our welcome basket was vegan and even the soap in the bathroom was vegan. The cottage is within walking distance or a short ride of several vegan restaurants and an excellent health food store. We were a short ride away from all of the major tourist attractions and Michelle let us know when traffic is the heaviest so we could avoid it which was very helpful. The neighborhood was pretty quiet, except for a little noise from one of the neighbors but it was not a disturbance. The cottage was very clean and cozy. Outside was beautiful with a cute little private patio area and fruit tree. It was a very comfortable stay...truly an oasis.",clean
"Michelle and Barry's bungalow is the best airbnb I have stayed at so far. The house and the grounds surpassed my expectations and it was the perfect accommodation for my family of 4. There was so much thought and effort put into every detail of this rental - the welcome guide that included everything we needed to know about the property and the neighborhood, the wonderful ""supply"" basket with assorted snacks and treats, the fresh bagels from Brooklyn and the eggs and milk and fruit that were left for us, the 2 beers in the fridge and all of the other amenities of the house which were in perfect clean condition. Michelle is a terrific communicator and was so helpful when I first booked the house. It turns out we have babies the same age and she left a highchair and some very popular toys for us in the house. And, (this is the really amazing part) she referred us to her full-time nanny for babysitting so we had childcare all 3 nights that we were staying there, including New Years Eve!! <br/>The house was beautiful, old and perfectly maintained and clean, containing everything that we needed and nothing more. I highly recommend this listing! It is amazing!",clean
"Michelle and Barry's cottage in Silver Lake offered a lovely, stress-free airbnb experience! The place is hidden away from the main road, yet right in the middle of a lively LA neighborhood. Space is clean, tidy, sunny. It was a chilly weekend in LA, but space heaters kept the place cozy. Kitchen is well-equipped for cooking meals, laundry is easy, and the outdoor space is awesome (if only it hadn't been so chilly!). Michelle is great at communicating with guests and really goes above and beyond with amenities -- i.e. eggs, toast, tea, etc. made for some nice lazy breakfasts in the morning!",clean
"In the City of Angels, HAPPY Silverlake is a shining star oasis, with Michelle and Barry welcoming you into the family that is the real Los Angeles.  <br/><br/>HAPPY is Air Better and Best.  Michelle and Barry will make your experience their highest priority, your visit individualized to meet your needs, your stay the highlight of your trip to Los Angeles.<br/><br/>HAPPY is simply the best AirBnB has to offer.  Of all the hidden gems in Los Angeles, HAPPY turns out to be the highest among them.  Book this experience as a highlight of your visit, but please keep quiet so there is availability for me when next I visit!<br/>",location
"I stayed in this room for a week. This is a very clean and beautiful house. Matt really attentive and caring host. He's an interesting person. When I slept on the street was cleaning the road then Matt took care of it and parked my car. It was so cute. Matt even to drive me to soccer. He's a big fan team Galaxy. We had together a wonderful time. I had meet Leroy, this is a very sweet, lovely dog. All of my stay I felt right at home. I recommend this home for staying, you will like it.",clean
Great place to stay.  Place was just as described and exceptionally clean. Matt was very quick to respond and communicated very well.<br/><br/>I had a busy schedule and told Matt beforehand that I would need to arrive late and leave early.  Matt was very accommodating. He even took time late at night to give me advice for directions/traffic in the morning.<br/><br/>This is an excellent place and I would definitely stay again.,clean
Matt was very accommodating and was both welcoming and very helpful with my requests to check-in after hours and to gather some packages that arrived on various days prior to and after my stay!,clean
"Great place, nice clean home. Very flexible and accommodated my very late arrival. I was welcomed by a kind, courteous host at nearly 1am! My first airbnb experience and it absolutely made me want to use this service again! ",clean
"Matt was really friendly and welcoming, as was his housemate - they are really great guys and it's a very laid back environment. Although the house was further out from LA than we anticipated (relying on public transport isn't great in LA!! Took a long time to get Downtown especially as there were rail improvements being made during our visit!) There are lots of eateries and a mall quite close by, and it's about 10/15mins walk to the train station. <br/>Thanks for having us Matt, we enjoyed our stay.",location
Very friendly welcome very clean room and well situated in a safe residential area. I was happy to leave my motorcycle outside. ,clean
"Very nice and clean space. Matt was a great host. Gave us insight on everything that was in the area: food, malls, stores, etc. He also provided us all the things we needed to feel right at home. He also respected our privacy.  I would definitely recommend staying with Matt. Great location.",location
"This place has been a great place as advertised! The house has a very homely feel and it is clean and tidy. It also has most things you need. The room I had was quite spacious and I could store my stuff, do work and rest well. Matt and his roomate have been really great hosts. They are really friendly and you can feel free to approach them if you have anything. The place is about a 15min walk to the nearest metro station which isn't too bad if you don't drive. Shops are also about 15mins away by foot and you can borrow a bicycle from matt (bring your own bicycle lock) if you need to. The neighbourhood is also generally safe. There were a few occasions when I returned to the place nearing midnight and I didn't have any problems. Overall it's a great place to stay. ",clean
"The place was great, very clean and spacious with a bed so comfortable the jet lag almost won. Downey has great transport links and it was easy to get into the city, though there are many great food and drink options within walking distance. Matt was an excellent, chill host who was always available when we had questions. If you're lucky he'll be your friend for the afternoon and take you out for burgers in his cool car!!",clean
Very beautiful and clean house. Bed was very comfortable.,clean
"Matt place is perfect! Clean and close to public transport if you need....getting the center by car will take 35/40min...like all main places... Nice guy who loves soccer, so good to share with him! Matt is good traveler too so i can understand your needs too! Go for it!",location
"We had a great stay at Michelle and Barry's place.  They had a nice assortment of snacks and things waiting for us, including fresh grapefruit from the tree in their yard.  Very clean and comfortable.  The location was great, too, just a block from Sunset Boulevard and some nice restaurants.  ",clean
"Michelle and Barry were excellent hosts. We only met Michelle right at the end of our trip but we communicated via email and text and she was very attentive. She also provided us with a basket of food on our arrival and there was a huge water dispenser to drink from.<br/><br/>The guesthouse was very clean and super comfortable. There was also a folder with loads of recommendations of restaurants and shops in the area and with detailed instructions for how to work everything in the house.<br/><br/>The road we stayed on was very residential but just 10-15 min walk away there were bars, restaurants and shops, and loads was within a short driving distance.<br/><br/>We really enjoyed our stay in this guesthouse. It was perfect!",clean
michelle and barry are two amazing hosts. They were quick to respond and the guidebook to the local area was accurate and worked really well for us. We would definitely book with them again!,host
"This was one of our favorite, and best  experiences with a vacation rental. The cottage is perfect for two with ample space for the small dinner gathering we hosted. Neighborhood is very walkable and convenient. The house had every amenity one would need and was super clean. The lovely porch, with its rockers, proved a beautiful environment to just sit and chit chat. We will definitely be back the next time we go to L.A. Hosts were super responsive and friendly, though we never actually met them in person. Overall, a fantastic 4 day holiday - and I'm quite picky! ",clean
"We had a great stay at Michelle and Barry's place. The house was clean, cozy and lovely. They left us some snacks and drinks which was so thoughtful and much appreciated after a long day of travel. We loved everything about this place and would def stay here again next time we're in LA!",clean
"Lovely and comfortable, and a great outside area! Thanks for hosting us!",location
"It's such a dreamy home! From the moment we walked in we were in love. There was a very informative binder on the dining room table, a welcoming basket full of treats, and grapefruits and oatmeal in case we wanted to eat breakfast. The space was exceptionally clean, and quiet. Sunset BLVD was a block away so it was easy to trek around on foot. <br/><br/>I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.",clean
"From the moment we booked, Michelle and Barry made us feel very welcome and excited about our trip to LA. The guesthouse was in a brilliant location for us with plenty of cool shops and bars nearby that we could walk to. On arrival there was a lovely hamper of food, breakfast items and some welcome drinks in the fridge. Perfect after a long flight! The guesthouse had everything we needed for three people, with loads of towels and bedding. The place was really comfortable and had a gorgeous outdoor yard with plenty of seating where we ate our breakfast. We'd happily stay here if we visited LA again. ",location

"Matt is ADORABLE!!! His place is SO clean and smells SO good that we (my friend and me) were even complemeting him about it all the time an we bought the same product he uses to bring back home :) <br/>Everything that the other guests have said about him and is his place is true and I'm pretty sure that we're gonna be friends and that he'll end up visiting Brazil :D Great place to stay, great person to get to know!",clean

"Terrific casita, amazing resort, awesome host! Highly recommend, especially for family vacations. ",location
Monica's Casita Suite was great! Terranea is a lovely resort and Monica's place had gorgeous views on par with the rest of the resort. We were visiting for a conference and it was a great space to be and relax. Monica communicated well and we were well taken care of. I definitely recommend staying here if you have the chance to enjoy Terranea! <br/><br/>,location
Monica was a very responsive hostess.  <br/><br/>The Casita was beautiful and matched the pictures shown on the website in every way. <br/><br/>If you are a golfer you will love the proximity to the first hole of golf course. <br/><br/>Overall a wonderful stay at a world class resort. ,location
"The place is very nice , the resort is beautiful. I actualy thought it a house with 2 floors and was surprised that is like a top floor with 2 connected units and 1 separate unit, it was ok but next time I'll take a house. It is no oven in the unit We were going to bake the holiday cookies, so No baking in the unit. Overall it was nice. By the way very comfy beds :). Great for the family with small kids. ",location
What an amazing and spacious casita so close to everything! The staff were super friendly as well and made us feel right at home! We had the best vacation with our children and hope to book Monica's casita again soon!,location
Fantastic place with beautiful view at top notch resort.,location
Stunning in every way possible.  I can wait to return,location
"The best location, easy access to pool and restaurants! Love the amenities of having it more home like with full bathrooms, large bedrooms and a full kitchen with resort accommodations! 100% would stay here again!",location
"Better than advertised â the casita was perfect for our group of 6 â and the views from the casita and resort were spectacular. We saw dolphins every morning from our balcony and even spotted a couple whales!  Golf was steps away, as was the resort spa, and several pools and restaurants. Canât wait to visit Terranceâs again!",location
"The casita is amazing. Very clean, beautiful views, great location. Will definitely stay again!",location
Michelle and Barry's place was even better than anticipated. They made us feel completely welcome with a nice clean space and special snacks upon arrival. The place itself is private and comfortable- feels like you've got your own house to come and go as you please. Ramen place on Sunset was epic!!<br/>Couldn't recommend more!,clean
"We had a wonderful experience across the board with this stay. Michelle and Barry were exceptionally communicative and accommodating, providing a comfortable home in LA for some international wedding guests. Michelle worked with me to ensure that their check-in process went smoothly, and that they had all the information needed to make full use of the amenities and local area. Arriving to a gift basket of coffee, fruits and other treats was a delightful surprise, particularly after a very long flight.<br/><br/>The space itself is beautifully built out, and very comfortable. A canvas shade sail stretches over the sizable private brick courtyard, providing a cool place to relax and enjoy a cup of tea. The ambiance is charming, slightly rustic, and very inviting. It feels well-considered and tasteful, rather than curated or contrived.<br/><br/>The house itself is well-appointed, comfortable and enjoys a lot of natural light. While helping our guests check in, we commented that it's a place we'd want to consider ourselves if we ever did an LA staycation. The fold-out futon was great for the kids, and the full kitchen makes it suitable for longer stays.<br/><br/>Overall, this was an unqualified Airbnb win and we're happy to recommend Michelle and Barry's little oasis of calm to anyone looking for a great place to stay in the Silverlake area.",location
"We had a wonderful experience in this place. The house is awesome, especially the outdoor space! Michelle and Barry were great hosts, they provided us some snacks and drinks which was so thoughtful! We love this place a lot the would definitely stay here again next time weâre in LA! Thank you so much for hosting us!",location
This is by far the best Airbnb we have stayed at ever. Michelle and Barry were so helpful and kind. They gave us great tips on the area and had a wonderful visitor's book. The house we stayed in was really nice and wonderfully decorated. This is the only place I will stay on return trips to LA. Better than advertised. ,location
"I can't recommend Michelle and Barry's place highly enough. The house is gorgeous, the outdoor space (with fruit trees!) is fantastic, and the neighborhood is fantastic while the house itself is very peaceful and quiet. They were great hosts who made me feel very welcome. The next time I'm in L.A. I will make it a point to seek this place out again.",location
"I have a family w/3 little ones so most AB & B properties seemed resistant, hesitant or flat out denied us.  This was not the case at this property.  Very easy to deal with honest and quick communication.  Property, and interior was clean and well taken care of.  No surprises which was nice.  Our stay was during a hot spell in LA and the house living areas stayed nice during the times we had the a/c on.   ",clean
This is one of the best Airbnb properties I've used.  The apartment has been meticulously and beautifully remodeled - the pictures are completely accurate.  The host has gone out of his way to provide above and beyond a normal Airbnb experience.  The location is unbeatable and the building is quiet.  I will most certainly stay here again!,location
"It's simply the best experience I had, it's over way way better than a hotel stay over, the host take a whole other level to make me feel home, always answering questions even he provides answers before I ask, the unit is spacious comfy, every thing you need you will find it cause the host already put it there,Kitchen with supplies even with drinks and foods, entertainment ""DVDs surround system showtime channels even a puzzles games,I loved the pillows and sheets, it's absolutely gorges I definitely gonna recommend it for my family and friends, I wish to stay there again.",clean
"I would not hesitate to recommend Ari's unit to anyone needing a very nice, upgraded 1BR in Westwood. He and his wife are focused on making the stay comfortable - they  had croissants, fresh milk, Mexican coke, Stella, etc in the fridge.  It really was very kind and above and beyond what I normally experience.  If you need a place in Westwood, located very conveniently to UCLA, the 405, Wilshire etc I would not hesitate to recommend.  Simply the best experience I have had to date with Airbnb.",clean
"We stayed in Ari and his wife Shab, condo on our recent trip to LA for a conference.  We had a fabulous trip!  Their condo is Amazing!  Everything we needed and extra touches that made us feel welcomed and at home.  We were so comfortable and really appreciated how accessible they were if we needed anything but we still had privacy.  They are fantastic hosts,  the condo is beautifully decorated, super clean,  and so comfortable!!!  And the hot tub was incredible.  We definitely will be referring our family and friends and returning ourselves.  Experiences like this is what makes Airbnb spectacular. ",host
"I was extremely happy with Ari's place. The other reviews are more than accurate, but I was so pleased I wanted to chime in. <br/>First, the host truly cares about the experience you have. If you like hotels (and who doesn't) this apartment will give you that feeling *and more.* Don't waste $400/night at a hotel, stay at Ari's.<br/>My stay was for 3 nights. The fridge had key things you'd need (incl candy, and I put that in the ""need"" category), and there were amenities in the bathroom as well. My chargeable Panasonic toothbrush died but no worries-- they had a travel toothbrush kit in the cabinet! Unlike at a hotel, no extra charges for whatever you use, which is awesome.<br/>I'm not a drinker, but there were beers in the fridge and even wine available. I prefer tea, and a kettle was right there. Score! Prefer coffee? They got that, too. <br/>Untimately, you can show up at Ari's with just the clothes on your back and a few toiletries and you're good to go.<br/>Things can go wrong, and for a bit the internet went down, but what matters is how the host reacts when there's an issue: I messaged Ari, he responded within 5 minutes and was right on it with the ISP. It was fixed fast. <br/>There's no bathtub, but the shower is *fantastic,* & includes a rainshower head. <br/>Parking in a secure garage, near everything, and a quiet bluilding. I'm a writer, and was able to get lots of work done. <br/>The apt is beautifully renovated and appointed, but the rest of the bldg is not, but don't let that put you off, it's not really a factor in the experience.<br/>I also appreciated the fact that I encountered security guards in and outside of the bldg keeping an eye on things. There's a doorman and a secure front entrance. The apt is on the first floor & faces the street but is obscured by plants and trees, and I found no issues with noise. AC/heaters in both the LR and BR. <br/>You can't go wrong. <br/>Thanks Ari and Shab for making it so easy :) <br/>",clean
"Our first impression of the apartment was neat, cozy, and clean. And there was a plate of wonderful fresh fruits greeting us when we walked in.<br/>The kitchen had everything we need and more. The host has provided us some snacks, water, other refreshing beverages, and there were also a plate of pastries for us to enjoy.<br/>The host also provided us toiletries, shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, etc. It was definitely nice to have everything set up for us. Thank you :)",clean
"My stay at Ari's place was absolutely wonderful! This was my first AirBnB experience, and let me just say, the bar was set pretty high.<br/><br/>First, Ari was the most welcoming host. He wasn't able to meet me in person to give me a tour of the place, but that was no big deal. He left fresh cookies and fruit in the apartment for my arrival, and checked in with me frequently to make sure everything was to my liking. Such a great host!<br/><br/>Second, the apartment itself was amazing! Luxury Modern is quite an accurate description of the place. It was so inviting, and definitely a relaxing place to come back to during my busy work trip. It's a great location in West LA - close to UCLA's campus where there are plenty of restaurants, bars, etc., just a $5 Uber ride to Sawtelle (LA's ""Little Osaka""), and only a 20 minute cab to Santa Monica Beach.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved my stay at Ari's place, and I would not hesitate to book here again for any future trips.",location
Matt was very accommodating and answered any questions we had promptly. He gave us recommendation for great food near by.The place is essentially what you see in the pictures and was very adequate for a one bedroom. Great location for a great price. We definitely would stay here again. Thanks Matt.<br/><br/>,location
"Room was good, had a comfortable futon and two chairs and a table and many windows. Matt was nice. The area was great for us (easy to find a place to park for free, very close to the metro also), not exactly a party/cultural area, but it was convenient. Clean room and bathroom, big fridge to get your beers/wine cold!",clean

"Everything was perfect, even if we only stayed one night.<br/>We loved the candies, the water and his couch guestbook.",clean

Absolutely congenial and flexible. Fantastic value. My only regret is that I couldn't make time to stay an extra night! He has a lovely place and has fostered an environment that gives both privacy and communal experiences,location
"Matt has been a great host to us! He was very welcoming and friendly. The room was exactly as we expected it would be, and the house had everything we needed.

Our experience at Michelle and Barry's was perfect! We had our 2 teenage sons with us and their house was perfect for the 4 of us. We had a nice space to hang out together as well as privacy when we needed it. The kitchen and rooms were well appointed and everything was just as they described. When we arrived there was a beautiful welcome basket and breakfast items for the next morning. It was just what we needed!,location
"Located in silver lake this stunning little house was literally our home away from home. The hosts ensured we had everything we needed, from food to wine to other drinks. The arrival was super smooth and the house was excellent. <br/>It's a little away from the downtown area but we wanted that and it says so, so that wasn't a problem. In fact I would recommend every one staying here in LA as it is in a very nice residential area and only an uber ride away. In the madness of LA , this locality and the stunning ( almost 100 year old ) house is just what you want. <br/><br/>It has a great sitting out area, where we sat and chilled for a long time. <br/>The arrival details and every thing were provided perfectly by the hosts. <br/>10 on 10 for me. ",location
"We stayed at the house for three nights and had a great experience. They left a welcome basket for us with snacks and wine and even some stuff for breakfast. They have a welcome book, that has all the information you need about the house and location with some suggestions for the restaurants and things to do.<br/><br/>The house is located behind the main house, and you have complete privacy and very nice patio. The house is very spacious, and there were 5 of us there including our seven years old son, and there was enough space for all of us. Everything was clean, and you would never say that the house is 100 years old.<br/><br/>The location is really good; there are some good places to eat and grocery stores with 10 min drive. We would definitely stay there again.<br/>",location
Michelle and Barry were great. Very prompt in responding to any needs. And the house was great and any contingency was addressed ahead of time by our hosts. ,clean
"We found so nice the fact they left goodies for us like breakfast, a bottle of wine, popcorn, coffee... The house was very clean and cozy and the location was great. We definitely recommend this house to stay. ",clean
"The happy cottage is a such a find! Michelle and Barry are perfect hosts, just a described -- laid back but super organized. We arrived to the cottage and should have looked a little closer before we shopped: the cottage is well stocked with all the basics, plus a little goody basket with yummy muffins, fruit and treats -- all high quality, organic goodness.  The full size fridge and cooking essentials are super, as is the adorable Wedgewood stove. The guest book is clear and full of all info you could ever need to navigate the neighborhood. <br/>We loved the location -- it was easy to get where we needed to go for my daughters workshop, and then come home to a cool neighborhood that has great restaurants and shops galore.  Parking was easy in the neighborhood. Check in and check out were easy peasy.<br/><br/>My two daughters and I absolutely fell in love with the cottage -- it's a great space with a good vibe. We were reluctant to leave and can't wait to return next summer! I highly recommend it!",clean
"This B&B is the cutest thing ever. <br/>It's got a great home feeling from the first moment you open the door. Perfect location! It's on a quiet block, but close to everything. The welcome book has everything you'd need to know or want to learn about the area. We weren't sure about B&Bs because we had never tried them before but it was so worth it. Our stay was fun and eventful and it was nice to be able to come back, feel at home and feel safe and have our privacy. Michelle was very quick to respond and very friendly. I would definitely suggest checking this place out!",location
"Wonderful home!! Great location with lots of great food easily accessible. House was cozy and clean and well decorated. The snacks were so thoughtful! It had everything we needed and was quiet and in a private, beautiful setting. Excellent communication as well. Easy parking on street but watch for street signs (we got a ticket, and I should know better from living in cities). Everything about the rental was perfect. We are grateful.",location
"Perfect house, it's in a good position, sunset blvd is really around the corner and it's very clean and comfy. Michelle and Berry are very kind, polite and very helpful, they answer almost immediately if you have a problem or you need something. The only bad thing we found was the parking because it's really hard to find an empty spot late at night, but if you're willing to walk a bit, there are empty spots a little far away from home. My friends and I will definitely come back to this house!",clean
"This was such an amazing find for my family. Traveling with a one year old is an adventure, but Michelle and Barry made it easy for us with their delightful cottage set back from the hustle and bustle of Sunset. They provided a pack n play, high chair, some toys, and even a sippy cup and bowls for our daughter. This was a life saver! Even better, we were able to let our daughter sleep in the bedroom while we slept in the family room and still had access to the bathroom through the kitchen. Ideal!! There was a bit of noise from the neighbors on Saturday night, but turning on a fan or the AC drowned it out completely. The place came fully stocked, which was incredibly helpful. We'll definitely be back here when we visit SoCal next.",location

A+++ experience. First time AB&B user and couldn't have been better. We just needed a place for a night and had never been to LA. Matt made us feel like we had been his roommates for years. He also gave us info on local spots. I would recommend his place to anybody.,clean
"Staying with Matt was a breezy first experience with air BnB. The room was quite and comfortable and Downey is clean and safe. Matt is an easy going guy and a great host. If you're planning on spending a lot of time close to downtown however it may be worth spending a little more money on booking a place closer, as it costs you about $20 each way to get an uber in.

"This was one of my best Airbnb experiences. Here's a nice, cozy room, furnished with everything you need. The apartment also was very clean. For my arrival, Matt kindly left me in the room some snacks and a bottle of water. <br/>I thoroughly recommend this apartment for those traveling to LA: although it is not in LA, it is not far away from the subway station, with which you can easily reach every area of LA, from Downtown to Hollywood, etc.<br/>Quality/price: excellent.",clean

"We had our Thanksgiving family gathering at Michelle and Barry's.  Five people stayed there cozily and others, who live in L.A., came and went.  We arranged in advance to bring our dog, and Barry and Michelle were really generous, leaving treats and a dog bed.  The house itself is attractive and beautifully laid out, with a large dining area, well-equipped kitchen, attractive bathroom, and comfortable bedroom.  The young people in our group slept on the futon and in a sleeping bag on the floor.  Best of all was the patio, with lots of seating and shade, many succulent plants, and attractive lighting.  We brought a couple of additional small tables and had our Thanksgiving meal out there.  It was perfect for us.  In the mornings we had coffee at Cafe Tropicale--GREAT coffee.  We ate out one night at Elf--a good place for vegetarians and vegans--and some of us had breakfast at Millie's, which gets a thumbs up all round, though Cafe Tropicale has better coffee.  Friendly neighborhood, good for walking dogs and snagging reading material from the neighborhood little library.  We have stayed at a lot of Air B & B places in the U.S. and Europe, and this was one of our best experiences of all.  Barry and Michelle are friendly and gracious, and this bungalow is a perfect place to stay in Los Angeles.",location

He is very responsive, and willing to help us for anything. On the checkout date, he even allowed us to stay as longer as we want to, since our flight is midnight, and there is no other tenant that day. He welcomed and said goodbye to us in person, and plus the awesome apartment, convenient neighbor, this place really makes me feel like home!!!

Ari is an exceptional host, He stocked the fridge for us with a few essentials made us really feel welcome.... thanks ARI. The apartment is in a very good part of town, close to shops and right across from a nice park. The pool, jacuzzi and steam room was also very nice. When we go back to LA my first call will be to ARI to see if the apartment is available, its sooooo much better than a hotel! Put this one on your shortlist you will not be disappointed. ",clean

Great place! Close to everywhere I needed to visit during my trip. The bungalow is set back from the street so you don't hear any of the traffic noise from the busy street. Added bonus was the outdoor living space. It was beautifully manicured with comfortable patio furniture. Perfect spot to kick back and relax with a glass of wine.,location
"Very quiet, set back off of the street, feels like a private home.  As a former LA resident, it reminds me of many places I lived.  Parking can be a challenge, but that's Silver Lake.  It happens.  Not their fault, but factor that in.  ",location
Michelle and Barry are great host! They have a amazing yard and a beautiful house! Looking forward to stay there again.,location
"The back house at Michelle and Barry's was a dream best to spend Christmas in with my family. It really feels like an oasis tucked away from the city craze, but still close enough to walk to most anywhere in silverlake/echo park. Our hosts were away during the time we were there but still accessible and attentive via messaging to ensure we were all set up, and they were so thoughtful providing the essential groceries and a beautiful welcome basket to make us feel at home. They even left some toys and high chair for our 2 year old. We would definitely stay at this house again on another visit.",location

He's generously stocked up his fridge with drinks and breakfast items. We would definitely go back. Can't thank him enough for making our trip so enjoyable. ",host
"Ari is an excellent host. He was very helpful and responsive throughout the booking process, and his hospitality extended to after we arrived. There were plenty of cookies, drinks, coffee, and snacks that he provided for us. He even bought a loaf of bread for our breakfast the next day!<br/><br/>The location of the unit is excellent. It's just a few blocks to Westwood Blvd where there are plenty of restaurants and grocery stores. We did not rent a car, and the bus stops were also conveniently on Westwood.<br/><br/>We did use the extra bed for my son. It is the most comfortable folding bed that we have used, and since the living room is very spacious, we let the bed stay open all day without any major interruptions to our daily activities.<br/><br/>My only complaint for the unit was the presence of friendly insects throughout (there is at least 1 spider in each room, and lots of flying midges. There weren't the biting type, and only caused annoyances. I think they are from the beautiful potted plants that Ari left around the unit.<br/><br/>One other inconvenience was the door of the washer which does not open fully, making it a bit awkward when trying to load up the machine. With some creative use of materials, we were able to prop it up during loading.<br/><br/>Overall, we loved the unit, and we would definitely book again when we return to LA in the future.<br/><br/>Thanks Ari for your hospitality and generosity!",location

Within 3 Minutes drive you are on the freeway and Highway.<br/>We have not met Ari, but we met his wife Shab who shows us the apartment. With both we had a very nice contact.

The apartment was well decorated, clean and comfortable, we also had access to a lovely pool and jacuzzi.

To be quite honest we can't fault it and would highly recommend this host and apartment for your stay in Los Angeles.",clean

"Matt was very nice from the very first moment. He showed me around the house and told me the simple house rules that he had. The house was very clean and Matt often went around making sure the place was kept that way.<br/>Quite far away from the city, but there was a space museum just around the corner and lots of stores only a few minutes drive away.",clean
"Matt's place is really nice and clean and there is everything needed for a few nights stay. The sofa is quite comfy, best suitable for couples (I was with my sister) if two sleeping in it as it is quite small. The location might be central in greater LA but if the focus is on LA and Hollywood notice that it is a looooong way there, especially if using public transportation as we did spending 1,5 h to get to downtown LA. Otherwise it's great and I highly recommend Matt's place to anyone! ",clean

"Matt was unwelcoming and made us feel awkward in the home. He didn't bother to show us around and then had a go at us for using something in the kitchen we shouldn't have. If he had showed us around and told us this would not have happened! <br/>Matt watches tv very loud until late at night, we didn't feel like we could ask him to turn it down due to feeling so unwelcome there in the first place.<br/>The neighbourhood is Okay, you need a car to get around though.<br/>Matt told us it was 'very easy and direct' to LAX, but he failed to mention it takes 2 hours.<br/>There was a stain on the sheets when we left which we didn't know about, Matt asked us to give him cash (against airbnb terms and conditions) and then was extremely rude to us when we were trying to resolve it in the resolution centre, especially considering we were offering him money through goodwill as he had opened the claim far too late. Matt clearly has never read the terms and conditions of the service he claims to take pride in. <br/>Worst airbnb we have ever experienced.",location

Not only was it close to the hospital but it is in an amazing area of LA (that I look forward to coming back to explore in happier times).  <br/><br/>I really just needed a place to sleep and shower, but I got SO much more.  The apartment was a safe haven, a place of respite from the stress of hours spent at hospital.  The bed was unbelievably comfortable with silky soft sheets - and the shower was enormous and luxurious with soft, fluffy (and plentiful) towels.  The apartment itself is super clean and modern with comfortable, stylish furniture and adorned with gorgeous art.  <br/><br/>But it was the little things that really made this such a wonderful Airbnb experience.  The easy (and early) check in.  The personal and genuinely thoughtful welcome note.  The bottle of wine (much needed).  The delicious chocolate chip cookies (not at all needed, but devoured nonetheless).  The provisions in the fridge.  The private patio.  I didn't get a chance to use the pool or the gym, but they looked great.  I didn't even have time to do my laundry but there is a washer and dryer right there in the apartment for your convenience.  <br/><br/>This place was just awesome and if I had to say one negative thing about it, it would be that I'm afraid it won't be available next time I visit LA.  I couldn't recommend it more.  <br/><br/>May 2016",location

The cottage has everything you need plus the treats that Michelle and Barry provide.  Plus the fresh grapefruit off their tree.

"If I have to say something regarding my experience, I would simply put  ' It was a Neato ' . An awesome experience amongst all the journeys I had so far. <br/>It was like a ' multicultural assembly '  from all around the world  (youâll know it after reading Mattâs guest books). <br/>During my stay, I had a chance to meet with cool people from Germany, India ... and even wonderful Texans; and all of âem regardless of nationality and cultural differences, were so close and friendly like they know each other for years. Donât know if this had to do with their (these People) Personalities  or  the atmosphere of the home or Mattâs behavior which turned people to be cool and have fun together ;  and no matter how was your day, the afternoon among the others always turns out to be a cool fun time. We even did cooking in turns, each cooked her/his  traditional cuisine and common dishes from their countries. Matthew and I did some gardening too which was so fun the way he pruned the bushes. <br/>We had several Barbecue gatherings, â¦ even a surprise birthday party, which Me and Matt arranged For ' Nadine ' (one of the cool guests from Germany). <br/>The living room is more like a full-equipped home-theatre, there is a large collection of DVDs of any genera and Mattâs also a rock fan which is obvious by looking at his Room. <br/>Regarding his personality I should say: he resembles a wrestler in the middle of a serious and breath-taking battle, suddenly pops and bursts a laughing bomb which turns a heavy match to a laughing comedy. He doesnât take anything too serious, always cheerful, reliable, helpful and doesnât mind sharing his knowledge and helps you or even drives you to your destination (if you are not familiar with the area); he is also a well-organized person who cares a lot about hygiene and cleaning and you can see that in a super clean house; and in one word, despite he is young, you can't find a significant weak point in his personality. Heâs in love with sports and particularly soccer (taking a look at his garage you can see that) and he tried his hand at almost any sport from golf to surfing to biking and so on... ; It seems like he has experience in anything you could think of, from coaching to gardening to mechanicsâ¦; He has a classic mustang, following a family legacy on collecting classics;  and He has a Pit Bull, LEROY , which is so cool and Behaves , Friendly which I Grew Fond of It .<br/>The saddest part was that unfortunately I had to move and couldn't be there to go along with them to the rock festival (Ozz / Rock Fest). <br/>I wish the Best for Matthew and his Family, especially his cool dad Bruce, and I wish for Matt not to change his life style and never to lose the pace.<br/>",location

"If you need quick access to the 101 or downtown, this is the place. We got to Universal studios very fast. The home is like an oasis in the city and its close to lots of breakfast and dinner places. Michelle was super helpful and the food they gave us got us through the week. 5 stars!!!",location
"If you are looking for a tranquil space, this is it. Comforting accommodations inside and out. A secret hideaway indeed, but still so very close to everything. Loved re-connecting with my son, a local resident, in this charming rental instead of a hotel room/lobby, etc. Visited Dodger Stadium, Getty Center, Santa Monica Beach, Venice Beach, the Reagan Presidential Library, Warner Bros. Studio Tour, Forest Lawn Cemetery, Hollywood Forever Cemetery and Griffith Park Observatory. After all that, a great place for an afternoon nap too on our last day. No need for AC - nice breezes there day and night mid June.",location
"Michelle and Barry are the most awesome hosts you'll ever find! The 100 year house is a gem to find within the bustling city of LA! They treat you with the best ambience and with amazing stuff at home (wine, cookies).<br/>The patio is amazing to soak in the sun and get fresh air from the plantation around!<br/>Trust me, if you ever find this place available, just go for it! It's a gem! <br/>My (Hidden by Airbnb) post for this: (Website hidden by Airbnb)",location
This is the Second time we stayed in Michelle and Barrys cottage and soon we are coming back again. Great for kids. An oasis in the city. Cozy and quiet.,location
"Michelle & Barry's place was absolute perfection! It was so clean and beautifully designed. My partner and I had a wonderful time. Before the first night ended, we already started to plan for future stays. Super cute neighborhood, lovely private front porch/garden for outdoor relaxing. The snacks! Michelle & Barry go out of their way to provide a plethora of delicious snacks. We were so pleasantly surprised. The dilemma was that the space was so beautiful it was hard to leave to go out to explore! They were always available through the phone or messages if we needed them but respected our privacy. This was an absolute dream! They have set the bar so high! Can't wait to come back!!",clean
"We had a great stay! The cottage is lovely and well located, beds are comfortable, and we loved the attention to detail to make our LA visit a great one.",location
Michelle & Barry's place is a charming bungalow unit that is comfortable and centrally located. I enjoyed my stay here and would definitely recommend it if you're looking for a spot to relax while in LA.,location
"We loved staying at Michelle and Barry's bungalow! It was so comfortable and secluded, with a beautiful courtyard in front. They even set up the air bed and pack n play for us before we got there, and provided snacks and breakfast foods which were so appreciated as we were very weary travelers. Their guidebook of local attractions was also very helpful and comprehensive. We would love to stay here again! ",location

"The stay with Mat was great this is my second time extending with Mat. His home is comfortable, quiet, clean, and a great location for easy access to restaurants and shopping. Mat is a great host and goes above and beyond to make sure I felt welcome and safe. I enjoyed my stay so much I will be extending a third time. Definitely a great first Air B&B experience.",clean

Matt's place is clean and mostly quiet. The neighborhood is quiet as well even though it's next to a highway. I've extended my stay a little bit longer just because the situation is so ideal.,clean
"Matt was a great host! He made sure I was comfortable and didn't mind answering any questions I had. The space was just as advertised, and close to public transportation and the highway which made getting to and from the city easy. I would definitely book with Matt again!",clean
Perfect place hope you get more travel Rn. Thank you for letting me personalize my set up and sending my stuff back to me. Super host for sure ! The futon can be a little stiff for some but then again I am used to a sleep number bed so futon in comparison to a $5000 bed is not quite fair. However Matt was super nice in letting me customize my set up. I added a foam topper with a cotton top layer so I would not get sweaty and I was sleeping like a rock! I walked to Kiser Downey for work 12 min walk. The house is situated in a quite residential street. There is on street parking outside. Quite home no parties. The shared bathroom was very clean all the time. The room has a small desk and chair . Overall the expirence was great and if I find myself in downey again I would not hesitate to book there again.,location
"Matt is an amazing host, and the room is just as he describes. The area is mostly quiet, and a great value for the booking. I would definitely stay here again.",location

Best Airbnb host as of yet!!!,clean
GREAT host!!!!,clean
Dope place I would come back,location
"Matt is an excellent host. This was my first Airbnb stay and I felt right at home the entire time. The room is exactly as described. The location of the house is very convenient. Thereâs a shopping center and the cheapest gas right up the street. Any restaurant you can think of off the top of your head is within 2 miles.  On my days off, I would catch a bus to downtown Long Beach (13 miles) or a Lyft to the Hollywood area (22 miles) for some studio tours. Downtown Los Angeles is about 15 miles away. Parking situation is wonderful. You can park in front of the house or thereâs a whole wall you can park alongside right across the street. Just have to be sure to move your car during street sweeping hours on Mondays. Unfortunately I had to end my stay about a month sooner than expected because my internship ended due to the coronavirus pandemic; but even the early checkout went smoothly. Highly recommend.",location

Matt was a great host. His place was very clean. The bed was very comfortable. The house is nicely located and everything from groceries to restaurants/fast food and shopping are very accessible.  Would love to stay in his place again. Would recommend it to friends.,clean
"Mattâs place is *exactly* whatâs shown, and if you need a quiet, quaint bubble on the outside of the usual noise of Los Angeles, this is the place to go. The house is kept incredibly clean, itâs easy to come and go, the pool was kept in practically pristine condition, you can be as social (or not!) as you prefer, itâs close to multiple interstate entrances, shops, plazas, cheap gas stations (Arcos that maintain their minimum price range(s)). Not a whole lot to complain about here!",clean
Accurate description of listing. I was there for work for almost two months. Very close to a large shopping center and my workplace which was really convenient! Matt was very friendly. I had a great stay!,location
Matt is a great friendly host and he just makes you feel at home. He helped a lot and answered my questions which i had a lot because I am new here.,clean
Everything was as listed an extremely comfortable.,clean
This place was great. Iâm a new travel nurse full time and still working part time at my home hospital. I had 8 shifts in a row so I had to stay at Mattâs place to help save my sleep and commute. Right in the middle of the 2 hospital. The place was very clean. Smelled great and felt very homey. Matt was very nice and a great host. Very quiet place. And the location of the home is next to some great food places. Loved the commute and the places to eat before I came here. Totally recommend and would come back if I have another 8 shifts in a row.,clean
Great stay! Matts place is very clean and relaxed. Matt was a great host and made the extra effort to ensure I had a great time.,clean
"Unbelievably nice, wonderful stay",location
"This was one of the most lovely apartments we have rented. It's in a very nice neighborhood and close to UCLA, Hollywood, Beverly Hills, etc. We enjoyed arriving to a clean and beautifully appointed place with wine on the counter and breakfast items in the refridgerator. The bed was very comfortable. All linens were clean and of good quality. There were plenty of towels and beach towels. Kitchen has everything you could need. Ari was a wonderful host and communicated with us regularly to make sure all our needs were met. The pool is very nice and surrounded by beautiful koi ponds. We would stay at this listing again in a heart beat. ",clean
"When we arrived at the place everything was just as advertised (although pictures always make things look bigger). The space was clean, comfortable, very well appointed. Ari had left an extensive care package of things you could use for your first breakfast and beyond so you didn't have to run out and shop right away. The facilities including a well stocked workout room with sauna and steamboat (which I never used) and a jacuzzi and pool (which I sure did use) and a whole outside lounging area were literally steps away for our unit. There was even a pond with koi fish and 7 turtles! (Our grandkids loved that!). The garage was so convenient and close to the unit and the location was excellent. You can walk to Westwood Blvd where there are all kinds of shops and places to eat (try Soleil for brunch and bottomless mimosas on weekends). As we were leaving we found out that there was some issue with the condo management and Ari was not sure if he could do Air BnB again but I sure hope they work it out because we would definitely come back! So, highly recommended  and Ari was great to work with.",clean
"Ari is a wonderful, gracious host! He met us at the apartment on check-in, showed us where everything was, and even provided fruit, beverages, and a bottle of wine! When we had questions, he responded quickly. <br/><br/>The apartment was exactly like the pictures and impeccable! We particularly enjoyed the patio, pool, and gym. Location is great, too. We will definitely stay again! ",clean
"One of the best Airbnb rentals I have stayed in.  Wonderful condo with all imaginable amenities.  Ari even had wine, bagels, and some starter groceries there on our arrival.   He was very easy to communicate with even when our flight was delayed.  Fabulous pool and great workout room in a very convenient location.  I can't say enough about this wonderful condo.  Highly recommend! ",location

The apartment included Wi-Fi, a TV in the living room and bedroom, books and guides, bathroom toiletries including hair dryer, even a toothbrush for those who forgot theirs!  Ari provided a warm welcome with a bottle of wine, drinks, bagels, bread and water to make us feel at home.  The apartment included a washer and dryer, 1 parking spot in a secured garage, and access to the gym and outdoor pool and whirlpool which are steps away from the apartment.  Ari is very responsive and a great host.  We enjoyed our stay and would recommend his apartment!",clean
The host canceled this reservation 37 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.,clean
Ari is a great host. He met me at the check in time and explained everything in details. He had a great welcome package with all sorts of beverages in the refrigerator.

"My wife spent a very pleasant week at Ari's perfectly located Westwood apartment when she was visiting our daughter at UCLA. It is spacious, very comfortable with great attention to detail, a home away from home. It has a lovely little private patio and an assigned parking spot. The apartment is part of a well maintained building with a concierge and access to beautiful pool area. Ari himself is very helpful and prompt in responding to all requests she had. I would highly recommend this apartment and would love to stay there again when I revisit Westwood.",location
We stayed at Ari's for 9 days and would thoroughly recommend it. The flat is great with everything you would need and the facilities are amazing. The area is also very nice with lots of good restaurants only a few minutes walk away and it's a short drive to Santa Monica beech. Ari was a lovely host and very attentive. Couldn't recommend staying there more.,location
"Ari is a great host who always is around and would be there in 10 minutes if needed..<br/>I have stayed for a month in his apartment and I can't describe how grateful I am to how things are prepared and well equipped<br/>The place is very close to restaurants, CVS and Westwood <br/>Thank you Ari for making our stay delightful..",location
"Great host and great apartment! We had a wonderful stay at AriÂ´s place. The furniture of the apartment is very well thought and tasteful, so that we completely felt at home during our stay.

This is a lovely condo near UCLA. It has all of the things you will need other than groceries. This host is the ultimate.<br/><br/>My tween daughter and I slept well and felt safe here.,location
"Ari is an outstanding host and the apartment/condo is impeccable. The location was perfect for me and my partner as I was a visiting professor at UCLA and I could either take a walk to my office or catch a shuttle from a nearby stop. Excellent restaurants and grocery shopping were all very near and so convenient. The apartment itself is very clean, cheery, and extremely well-stocked with everything you could imagine you would need. Plus, all the kitchen appliances, dishes, pots, pans, etc., were consistently of high quality. If you feel a need to get to the beach, you can also do so  since it is a very easy drive to Santa Monica. A little further up the coast you'll find some nice and not overly crowded beaches as well as the Getty Villa.  The freeway entrance is neither too far nor too close, which was also nice. As for Ari, he is a very intelligent and considerate person who did everything to make our stay a wonderful experience. He always responded to our emails and text messages very quickly and accommodated all our special requests. We felt spoiled. The front staff in the complex were also pleasant and helpful. If the chance arises, we would definitely stay again.",clean
One of the best experiences/ places Iâve stayed on AIRBNB. Ari was awesome and took great care of everything,clean
"You wonât be disappointed with this property. It is better than advertised. Ari is an exceptional host and was extremely responsive when I had questions or minor problems with WIFI.

Look forward to returning when shops , restaurants and museums are open!!",location
"I can not say enough about how great this place and esp Ari is. We stayed for 1.5 months and before staying, i asked if getting a desk was possible - not only did he agree but he got a great desm. Additionally, he was really attentive to any question we had. The reviews are correct in naming ari a fantastic host.<br/><br/>Def recommend!",host
"Convenient location, easy parking access, comfortable accommodations, and very responsive host. This rental has everything you need to feel at home.",location
"Ari's apartment is one of the best AirBnB's that I have stayed in. We stayed for a month here after moving to the US. The apartment was perfect for the combination of work, living, and fun that we needed.<br/><br/>The photos listed are fully accurate; the apartment is spacious, well appointed, and very clean. The kitchen has all you need to cook with, and Ari very kindly left us with supplies and drinks ready for our arrival, as well as toiletries in the bathroom.<br/><br/>Ari is a brilliant host; he is kind, friendly, and willing to help with any issues you might have. On one occasion the wifi went down (due to the provider, nothing to do with this AirBnb) and Ari sorted everything out on the phone with them, and even came to sort it out with the repair person, so that we could still go out and enjoy our day.<br/><br/>The building itself is fantastic; quiet, safe, well appointed, friendly, and very well located. There are many shops and restaurants nearby, and it is near to both the 405 and 10 Freeways.<br/><br/>I highly recommend Ari's apartment for stays of any duration!",clean

It's a nice decorated house and it have anything you need. The back yard feels like an oaisis in the middle of the city. You will enjoy to hang out there after a day exploring LA. You will find many differents resturants and stores in the area. I strongly recommed this accomandation.",location
The house is convenient as it is located near sunset boulevard with different kinds of restaurant and big supermarket and gas stations. The parking place is ample. The housekeeper is quiet patient and kind to answer all our questions and find a parking place for us. It was an enjoyable experience.,location

We didn't have any problems finding parking either up or down the street.  We'd just park & walk to dinner. We'll definitely be back.",location
We loved the cleanliness and charm.  It is clear that they take pride in their home and property.  We wished we had stayed longer and if ever in LA we will return!,clean

Great  neighborhood with rad restaurants & shops.<br/>Michelle & Barry are the most thoughtful hosts: the cottage is stocked with everything you could ever need.  Really easy check in & out, and though we barley saw our hosts Michelle was quick to respond if we needed anything. I can recommend booking here without hesitation :)",clean

Would definitely recommend and stay again!",clean

I'd say the experience is even better than what I had expected with the pictures. The location is extremely convenient as well. There are shopping malls, restaurants, and grocery stores near by. I booked Sara's place to attend a work related conference. But going back to her place at night makes all the work stress go away. Please don't hesitate to stay here, it'll be amazing, I promise! (Cats are chubby and friendly!)",location
"Sara's space was heavenly! One of my best travel experiences. If it were possible to give 6 stars I would. From curb appeal to private entrance, the space is superior to the pictures. The private living room was so comfortable, and everything I could imagine needing was there, even a robe! Wow! Snacks, coffee, water, wine, pens, pencils, scissors (which I did need and used!) I loved sitting out on the private patio in the sunshine.  Also, when I needed something for my cold symptoms, Sara was on it! Since I did not have a car and relied on a friend for rides, it was especially wonderful to have the space stocked! Thank you so much Sara, you surely have a hostess' heart! ",space

And totally private -- with amenities, including a minifridge, coffeemaker, microwave, etc. Sara also provided a bowl of baked goods, juice, wine, all complimentary. Really terrific situation, far better than a hotel. Only wish I'd been able to stick around longer; my conference kept me busy. ",location

Thank you Sara!! :) ",clean
Sara's place was wonderful! It is exactly as described. It is very private.  Sara had a lot of different pastries and drinks with a welcome card and a sheet describing things like how to get Wifi.

I highly recommend her place to anyone.,location
Sara's place was wonderful!  I felt that the pictures did not do the mini-apartment justice! It was so much nicer than I was expecting.

She had the iron and ironing board ready for me when I walked in the door!  :)  The apartment was in pristine condition and very comfortable.  She had a spread of goodies and drinks waiting for us...The yard was beautiful and I was sad that we didn't have time to enjoy it.  She lives in a very nice neighborhood and it was super convenient to the wedding functions we attended.   I would highly recommend the Mini Apartment to anyone needing a place in the Valencia area.   ,clean
"Sara's marvellous Mini Apartment was my first experience of Airbnb, and WOW!! has she set a high standard! Everything - bed, furnishings, bathroom, facilities - was wonderful. The fridge and table were packed with tasty treats, fruit, wine, juices, pastries, etc. <br/>Immaculately clean, secluded and secure, the accommodation was nevertheless a pleasant walk (thanks to Sta Clarita's Paseo system of leafy walkways) from CalArts, where I was visiting my daughter. <br/>I didn't have time to try the hot tub, nor the private community pools, but the tv was welcome and the huge sofa welcomingly sift. I cannot praise or recommend too highly this lovely spot. AND they have two charming kitties!",clean
My family and I have fallen in love with Sara's place and her hospitality. She has prepared this place with intricate details keeping in mind the complete  convenience of her guests.

Sara's place in Santa Clarita was awesome. We arrived in the middle of an 18 hour road trip and she showed us right to a private and cozy space. She set up a (very comfortable) extra couch bed for us too! We took advantage of the running/walking trails just steps from her door. She had a stocked fridge and pantry of snacks and drinks in addition to just about every toiletry item we might have needed. It was a bit hot to utilize the hot tub but the outdoor space was perfect. I would highly recommend this place to anyone in the area!,location
"This was a very comfortable bungalow. I think this was the first time it was rented so we sent the owner a list of a few suggested items for the next visitor. Nothing major, just a few pillows and stuff. The host provided complimentary water, snacks, bagels, coffee, juice, etc. which was a very nice touch. I would definitely recommend this place and stay here again!",clean
"It's a cozy little house but really airy and private at the same time. Took advantage of the front and back porch. An easy walk to a dozen great little restaurants and coffee shops -- and about a mile and half to the reservoir for a morning run. Only downside was parking after 6-7 p.m. was a little trickier -- usually wound up 2 blocks away -- but otherwise it was a dream. If you are looking for a place to stay and explore Silverlake and Echo Park, this is perfectly situated.",location

Everything you could possibly need was considered, and we especially appreciated the quality (sheets, towels, appliances, speakers, supplies). We enjoyed the privacy of the back garden, the well equipped kitchen and the books to browse through.<br/><br/>It was honestly perfect - we were welcomed with bagels, cream cheese, coffee, milk, wine (everything you could possibly need) and enjoyed our 6 days there. It was a great taste of a Venice bungalow lifestyle (we didn't want to go back to a condo!).<br/><br/>We will be renting it again for family when they come to visit, and/or if we ever need a place in this neighborhood. <br/><br/>Highly recommended.",location

"I loved this place and Richard was a wonderful host. The place was clean, thoughtfully stocked and is in a great neighborhood. ",clean
"This was my 1st time using Airbnb. My family and I were very pleased with our decision to rent from Richard. When I coordinated to rent this Bungalow, Richard reached out to me very quickly with a very detailed description of the necessary details about this property that would be needed to make our stay more comfortable which was very comforting (e.g. keyless entry code, wifi-5 information, inquiring about our arrival time for coordination purposes of ensuring someone was able to meet us at the property for a walk through, and inquiring about our favorite coffee, teas, and etc).  While I didn't meet Richard personally, Cara was available to provide assistance and met us at the home when we arrived. In addition, Cara was available to answer all of the questions that we had and was exceptional in providing feedback to us.<br/><br/>My family and I really enjoyed staying in this home. We felt that it was in a very safe neighborhood that was family friendly. Some of the highlights of this home include the privacy, the back deck and yard which not only provided privacy but also a great place for our dog to play. The water pressure in this home was exceptional and the bathroom and kitchen are very nice and appeared to have been recently renovated. <br/><br/>Richard's Bungalow provided additional features that we were not expected such as in the restroom, there was a bowl of travel products which included sunscreen, lotion, toothpaste, mouthwash, and make-up remover. In addition to this they provided healthy starter breakfast foods, coffee, and tea, and a bottle of wine. In the kitchen there is a washer and dryer that also has allergy free laundry detergent and bleach. There is also a dishwasher which included dishwasher products. While my family and I have stayed in numerous hotel suites, the personal touches that Richard put into our stay were things that I could not obtain in a suite without paying an additional fee. Everything that Richard provided in the home did not cost us an additional fee. <br/><br/>While I priced Hotel Suites in this area, they were not able to compare to the price and the amenities that were received in Richard's Bungalow.

The neighborhood is very safe, clean and quiet.  The backyard is artistically designed, the room is very bright and spacious.  Sara's thoughtful touch is everywhere, she even provided tooth brush and tooth paste.  I also enjoyed our conversation while using her kitchen.  We had a wonderful stay and would come back again if we're in the area. <br/>",location
"The Host was wonderful.  She made my son and I feel right at home.  Food and Drinks was included and I could not believe my ears when she told me.  We were hungry and she offered us Dinner.  Wow!<br/><br/>I like bike riding and had our bicycles with us.  I found many trails right from the end of the street where the house is located.<br/><br/>A bit of context here.  This was my very first AirBnB stay.  After we left this host and went onto our next destination AirBnB stay, I was spoiled already.  I was expecting the same but that was not true and did not even come close.  My stay here was top notch. ",host

"First things first.  Please book this lovely mini apartment with confidence!<br/>Sara was great with helping us with all the arrangements leading up to our week's stay.  She always answered all communications quickly and helpfully.  As an example, on the day we were due to arrive, our flight was delayed which meant we didn't arrive until after midnight.  Sara was sooo helpful in making arrangements for us to get access to apartment even though it was so late.<br/>It was lovely that when we arrived the fridge was stocked with drinks and there were pastries available to eat.  Plus lots of tolietries available too.  Fantastic.<br/>The location for us couldn't have been better.  A lovely quiet area but only a five minutes drive away from Six Flags Magic Mountain...the main reasosn for our visit.<br/>A great apartment. A real gem!<br/>Thank you!<br/>",location
This little guest house was perfect for our stay. The house was just as described and near everything we wanted to do.

"Sara's private mini room/studio was perfect for my partner and I. The living room had plenty of DVDs to choose from and the mini fridge in the bedroom was filled with beverages and goodies. Sara provide complimentary snacks, drinks, and had free tolietries for us to use. The home is perfectly located near a shopping center. Also, if you are planning to visit Six Flags I highly recommend you book with Sara and reserve your spot. <br/><br/>Thank you Sara! ",location
Sara was amazing and really made us feel welcome. She was there to give a helping hand when we needed some advice or if we wanted to use some of her awesome facilities. She provided us with lots of snacks and drinks and towels which were perfect after a long drive. Wifi was speedy and reliable.<br/><br/>The area was perfect for us heading to Six Flags the morning after; about a five minute drive away. In Valencia we caught an IMAX movie in the evening.<br/><br/>We only had a short stay but would highly recommend Sara and her amazing place. ,location
"Staying at Sara's was an excellent experience that I would recommend wholeheartedly! The mini-apartment was just as described, and larger than expected. It was spotless, and the drinks and snacks provided were generous and varied. Sara was a gracious and kind host, who was always available to answer any questions. The neighbourhood was great! Sara's is located close to grocery, shopping, and many fun attractions (including Six Flags!) If you are traveling with bikes, Santa Clarita is a great town with safe, lighted pathways.

Sara prepared tons of snack, bread, sweet, beverage, juice and even wine. How wonderful is that! She even mentioned we can use the hot tub and barbecue outside the house. Sara is a super cool mom and we love talk with her. We had a terrific time staying at her place and we use the microwave oven and refrigerator in our bedroom and Sara was so nice to let us boil the lobster we brought at Costco at her kitchen and she helped a lot during our stay.  At last she checked if there is missing luggages and she found my mom's clothes and brought to us while we were leaving. I definitely recommend stay at her place!",host

"We had a great stay with Sara - the perfect place to stop off on our road trip to LA. The apartment is self-contained at the back of the house, and is nicely set out, with movie posters on the walls and lots of little details included to make our stay a good one. We spent the evening with a glass of wine in the outdoor hot tub, before investigating the *excellent* DVD collection. Would definitely stay again!",location
"Host Sara was great. The online pictures and descriptions were so good I knew exactly what it would be like, except in some ways the reality was better. Small details like all the complementary drinks, and snacks. Or the fabulous paseo pathway system that starts five houses down the street. Totally safe neighborhood. Squeaky clean room. I liked it way better than a hotel. Best AirB&B ever.",clean
"Love this space and really enjoy how private it feels.  It's like your own little apartment.  I was working at Disney ranch a few days so this was perfect place to lay my head each night.  Really quiet neighborhood, and comfortable bed, etc.  The treats and complimentary beers and waters were a super nice touch as well!  Will definitely stay here again.",space
"We could not have been more pleased with this apartment. It was our first Airbnb experience and we've already booked our next stay!  It is quiet, comfy and felt more like relaxing in a living room.  My husband enjoyed the movie selection and it was nice to have the separate bedroom for our daughter to go to sleep while we relaxed on the super-comfortable sofa. Sara was a wonderful host!  Looking forward to our next stay! ",location
"Everything about this place was great.  Sara was great to communicate with me about our stay and any questions or concerns we had.  Her place is in very close proximity to Magic Mountain which is an annual trip for us and our kids.  There is also a grocery store and lots of amenities nearby.  The room is spacious and very clean and we really appreciated all the little things she left for us for our convenience.  <br/>We didn't use the pool or hot tub as we didn't have enough time, but we love that they are available.  We hope to make it our new place to stay for any future Magic Mountain trips.  We'll be back, if she lets us!  Thanks!",clean

Also the always ready to pop-in jacuzzi was relaxing after  the long walks in the many nature parks in the neighbourhood.",location
"What can I say but AMAZING! <br/><br/>Sara's little apartment was perfect . It  is attached to the house as the description states BUT you have your own privacy, a large bedroom separated from a small living room/den. She is one of the most thoughtful considerate hosts I have EVER had the pleasure of staying with. All amenities were thought of and provided so if you forget anything while on your trip I do not doubt she will have it available if not easily attainable for your visit.  <br/><br/>She was incredibly hospitable and flexible. Accommodating our late arrival and always a text or phone call away and very speedy with responses to any questions or concerns. I cannot say enough good things about the place. Was very neat, clean, and relaxing. I only regret that we did not have time to stay longer to enjoy the many comforts her home had to offer. <br/><br/>I absolutely look forward to staying here again on our next six flags trip! <br/><br/><br/>Thank you so so much for the wonderful experience !",host

"Wow we were completely blown away by the quality of Richard's place and his service. <br/><br/>Arriving from NZ to find snacks and breakfast to get over the jet-lag was an unexpected treat. The house was immaculate and  the location was spot on. We walked to see 4th July fireworks in Marina Del Rey and an $8 Lyft ride took us to Santa Monica then we walked back. Ideal place, ideal setting, perfect hosts. We'll be back,  ",host
Richard's 2 bedroom bungalow on Beethoven street was just as he described it.  He and his associate Cara took the time to prepare for our arrival to great detail.

We would recommend this location to anyone who wants access to the beach as well as the local attractions.,location
"Prior to staying at this property my communication with Richard was always pleasant and he responded timely as well. Myself and 3 friends stayed at this property over the weekend and it was absolutely amazing! The house was clean and well stocked with items from bagels, coffee, sugar, laundry detergent, tooth brushes, tooth paste, beach towels and best of all 2 bottles of WINE. We received much more than we expected. We were met at the home by Lori and she was very polite and welcoming even though it took us longer to meet her due to the wait at the rental car company. Throughout our stay Lori promptly responded to our simple requests such as the WIFI password. We were worried about the home not having central air conditioning but to our surprise we were very comfortable with the ceiling fans and cool breeze flowing through windows and doors.

He was always responsive, pleasant and left no questions unanswered. <br/>Once I landed Cara took over. Despite arriving to the house later than expected, she was completely understanding and met us at the house. Explained all the features and even got my friend a cake! They were super accommodating and I will definitely recommend and hope to come again!<br/>P.S: The backyard is awesome<br/>",location
Richard gave quick and informative answers to questions. Perfect practical information about the house in advance. House is perfectly replenished with everything you could ever wish for. Good location close to airport and Venice Beach. Wi-Fi was excellent. Beds could be more comfortable. With warm weather it also gets hot inside.,location

The place was fantastic. It's so nice to arrive late and have breakfast already stocked in the fridge by your host. The place overall was extremely nice and just as described.

The collection of books is quite eclectic and will find any reader quickly diving in. ,clean

"Richard's place was exactly what we hoped for, a peaceful comfortable oasis in the great metropolis of LA.  At the edge of Venice Beach and on the cusp of Santa Monica and just a little further to West Hollywood, and an easy drive to LAX on our departure, it was right in the middle of everything we wanted to do, without being caught in the hustle and bustle whenever we needed a break.  We also really appreciated that in addition to the comforts of the stellar appliances, fixtures, wifi and entertainment center, Richard stocked the kitchen with milk, yogurt, bagels, coffee etc, a true touch of hospitality.  We can see clearly why this place got such great reviews!  Also, if you want amazing takeout sushi/izakaya at a reasonable price be sure to go to Hamake sushi on Washington Blvd, we loved ordering there and dining in at the rental one night.",location
"Richard was an incredible host and super accommodating. There was a basket of fruit, wine, and other snacks upon our arrival. He communicated instantaneously and was always super helpful. The location was beautiful as well. We wanted to stay a few weeks longer but unfortunately due to the nonstop rains in LA our master bedroom wall grew some mold, which wasn't there when we moved in. My baby and I are both very allergic to mold so we had to cancel our reservation as she got really sick. There was also a mouse that ate our basket of fruit in the middle of the night. Other than those two issues, Richard was an excellent host and the house is wonderful. He even upgraded us to the nicer house because of a double booking. ",location

She had coloring books and crayons on hand for my son. AND knowing he loved cats, welcomed us upon arrival with her very sweet pet cat. Her books and movies collection were great. I could've easily not left the house and just spent the entire time poring through them. And even though she didn't need to, the eating area was stocked with snacks and drinks. Thank you, Sara, for such a great stay. We will definitely be making a return visit.",clean

Very welcoming.<br/>Sara was very accessible prior to check in and flexible with our arrival.<br/>One issue we had was that the heat to the unit comes from a vent in the bathroom and a gas fireplace in the living room. The bedroom was cold. Sara was surprised to hear that we were cold and offered a refund which we declined since the unit is wonderful and Sara is so thoughtful...<br/>We will definitely be back!<br/>Another huge bonus for me- the neighborhood is designed with endless pedestrian paths- all cul-de-sacs have an access to a path that goes on forever with bridge overpasses that cross all streets so you can walk and walk and walk forever - I LOVED it!<br/>I forgot my coat in the closet and Sara contacted me right away with an offer to mail it to me.

Well, those expectations were exceeded. <br/><br/>We checked in late, hailing from Disney and were greeted with a very cozy and well appointed space. We found a very thoughtful basket of goodies... well multiple baskets. We also found specialized breakfast treats for the morning since we relayed we loved avocado toast which was so thoughtful. The space had fresh flowers and plants and I appreciated the subtle holiday theme throughout the space. <br/><br/>It was amazing to have our own eating space out the side kitchen door, but we also utilized the main courtyard area as well. Be prepared to see a grapefruit and lemon tree, soo so many succulents and beautiful morning glories. <br/><br/>Even when I got sick (completely unrelated to the Airbnb) I was so thankful to have such a cozy, comfy space to hide in and recover while my friend went out and enjoyed the sunshine! <br/><br/>It's close to shopping (for bland foods or non bland foods), restaurants and if we had more time we would have biked.

I would highly recommend a stay here and we will definitely be back!",location
"Sara's mini apartment was great. Sara greeted us and gave suggestions as to a good Thai restaurant, walking trails and traffic concerns for the following day. The space was large, private and  had everything we needed plus a wonderful hot tub! The bed was comfortable and the area was quiet. We would definitely stay there again were we to have need of lodging in the area. ",location
"We had a really great first AirBnB experience! The mini-apartment was exactly as described and was comfortable and quiet. Thank you, Sara for the nice amenities such as the goodies, wine, flowers, and movie selection. Maybe next visit we'll have time to enjoy the hot tub and fire pit. ",clean
"Sara again has made me feel super comfortable!! Her place is amazing and luckily there was good weather, to enjoy the amazing garden she has.  I was able to do some meditation and at night time, I could light a fire inside the mini apartment and feel super cozy.  I love this place very much and appreciate Sara's hospitality and attention to detail!<br/>Thank you Sara!!",location
"We loved Sara's home! Both rooms were bright and spacious. Sara generously provided several types of food and drinks. She communicated clearly and gave us good tips on things to see along our trip. We would have enjoyed a longer stay! Thank you,  Sara!",clean

She is a great host and the room is perfect. Enough said. ,clean
Another amazing stay!,clean
"This place was exactly as described.  It was the perfect location for a wedding we were attending at the Newhall Mansion in Piru.    Sara made sure we had everything we needed.  My daughter, her husband and her 10 month old  ended up needing to stay one night with me.    Sara provided an air mattress so that we could have her stay with us.  Very nice quiet neighborhood.  Accommodations were clean and very comfortable!  Lots of room!!!  More than I expected in every way.    Thank you Sara, if the need arises again, I would love to stay there again.",location
I rented Sara's mini apartment to have a relaxing place to stay while up in Santa Clarita for a job interview. Sara was wonderful! She met me at the door and gave me a tour of the place. The den+ bedroom+ bathroom was more spacious than I thought it would have been and the bed was very comfortable. I also appreciated having the desk as a workspace since I had more preparing to do. The fridge was stocked with nice beverages and Sara had a nice assortment of pastries and fruit to welcome me. There was even a pool bag and set of robes/towels if you wanted to head to the community pool. You can tell Sara put a lot of thought into this. This apartment was exactly what I needed to feel relaxed and ready. ,clean
My friends and I really enjoyed staying at Sara's place! The neighborhood was nice and welcoming. Sara was very accommodating and the apartment was clean and well stocked with everything we needed. Adorable apartment and perfect for a multiple night stay.,clean
"We really enjoyed our stay at the Caldwell's. <br/>The private two room apartment was very comfortable, quiet and felt like home. <br/>Thank you Sara for the fresh fruit, food and drinks and wonderful hospitality. <br/><br/>Santa Clarita has amazing walking paths which Sara recommended. We walked for hours and enjoyed ourselves immensely.  <br/><br/>Thank you for a beautiful and very relaxing weekend. ",location
"Sara was wonderful and the place was awesome! So quaint, quiet and clean. I felt right at home. And that couch..! Hahaha. Amazing. <br/><br/>Sara came out front to greet us when we pulled up. So sweet. She walked us back to our unit/room/apartment and showed us what was what. Being my first ever Airbnb experience I could not have been happier. <br/><br/>You rock, Sara. Thank you so much for such a killer experience and the Clif bar! :P",clean
"Great little space. Sara had so many thoughtful touches! Little complimentary snacks, bagels, yogurt in the mini-fridge. Even a tooth brush and toothpaste!  Super sweet place. We didn't remember there was a hot tub so we didn't have swimsuits! Remember yours!!! Great, cozy suite in a quiet neighborhood with beautiful trees very close to a big mall with good restaurants. Thank you!",location
"This place is really nice. The house is clean and has full kitchen. Basically this is separate house with butifull front yard. Close to all tourists attractions like Universal  Studios, Griffith Planetarium. We enjoyed our stay here.",clean
"Michelle and Barryâs house is very clean, spacious and comfortable. They even prepared a lot of snacks, fruits, cereal and pancake powder for us. What all they did for us made us feel like home. The kitchen is well-equipped and we did enjoy our cooking during the trip! We also love the gardening style in front of the house. Michelle and Barry are very nice and helpful all the time. We highly recommend this gorgeous house for all LA travellers.",clean
"This is an excellent choice for those who are looking for an experience in the L.A. suburbs close to downtown.  Echo Park is a mixed neighborhood with some redevelopment but not yet enough to interfere with its earthy character.  You will see bars on windows, junk cars, taco trucks and stray cats, combined with a fair number of modish stores and eateries.  Get here while it is good!  This Airbnb is a period guest house behind an Arts & Crafts bungalow, set in a very private and lovely garden.  It couldnât be much nicer, and everything you will need is thoughtfully laid-out.  Street parking is fairly good but can get challenging in the evenings, and I got a $73 parking ticket due to my inattention to the signs.  The only wrinkle for us was that there is no network TV (only on-demand TV), so we couldnât watch the playoff games.  Highly recommended!",location
PERFECT!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,location
"Super super nice place. If you are visiting LA, it is a good choice to stay here.",location
"I was in Australia, Internet searching for accommodation in Santa Clarita. I stumbled upon Sara's private mini apartment. <br/>I'd never heard of air BnB and was a little uncertain about booking. <br/>I started to read many positive reviews about Sara's place and after comparing it to the reviews of other local Hotel/Motels, this private apartment was looking like it could be a pretty positive decision. <br/>I bit the bullet and booked 13 nights. <br/><br/>OMG! SO pleased I did! <br/>First of all, I get a bit ick about staying at hotels. I know most of the time they change the bed sheets but never feel so confident about the covers and how clean they are.. I could see straight away the covers on the bed had been freshly washed. Yaay! It felt SO GOOD to know there were no dead skin cells, sweat or other icky things I'd rather not think about on the bed I would be sleeping on for the next 13 nights. <br/>After looking around the spacious area, I discovered all the little bits and pieces and thoughtful offerings that I had read in all the previous reviews. <br/>There was snack foods and drinks, wine, coffee,  juice, lollies, bagels, muffins, fruit... The cupboard held robes to use and all the handy items such as iron and ironing board, laundry basket, storage space and of course the bathroom was also fully stocked. <br/>Sara puts allot of thought and effort in to making her guests feel at home. <br/>Outside was heavenly. It was peaceful and quiet but the best bit was there was a spa and fire pit. <br/>What better way to spend an evening lying under the stars in a nice warm relaxing spa and the crackling of a fire to cosy up beside. <br/>The location was also in walking distance to a pool and shops, parks and a major shopping complex.<br/>I spent 13 nights here, I proposed to my wonderful future hubby by the fire. The whole time the accommodation felt so private yet Sara and her family were only seconds away if we needed anything. <br/>Such lovely, fun and accommodating people to stay with. Such a wonderful place to stay and certain we will return here in the future.  <br/><br/>",location
"This was our first AirBnB experience, and it was great.  Room and space were exactly as pictured/described.  Very comfortable.  Even though it is someone's home, there is complete privacy.  We were visiting relatives in the area, so we were only there to sleep, but it would have been a very relaxing place to hang out during the day as well.",clean
"The room/bathroom/den were all very nice, clean, and secluded. We almost wished our trip was a little longer so we could stay an extra night! Great stay!",clean

We particularly enjoyed the nice deck overlooking the private fenced-in backyard--perfect for having a glass of wine and watching the dog romp. The neighborhood is quiet and perfect for strolling. We were always able to find parking on the street in front of the house. Thank you, Richard, we hope to return.",location
"This is a handsomely renovated 2 br/1 ba bungalow, and proved ideal for my month-long business stay in LA. Quiet neighborhood, convenient to freeways, about a 15 minute drive to Venice and Santa Monica. Great kitchen! It felt more like a a home than a hotel. Comfortable and well set-up. Pretty yard for my dogs to lie down in the sun on the weekends after a long run on the beach (Huntington Dog Beach and Rosie's Dog Park are both 40 - 50 minute drives, but well worth it for off-leash gamboling). And a shaded deck, perfect for a peaceful glass of wine at twilight.",location
"great location but also on a quiet and safe street.  The place had a nice sized yard where my pups could roam around.  Richard stocked the place with water, snacks and enough towels for our 4-day stay.   Would rent again next time we're in LA",location

"Believe the hype, because this airbnb is one of the best we've ever stayed in. First of all, the hospitality was incredible. Despite only booking 9pm the night before our intended check-in, and asking for an early check-in day of, and needing a last minute extension to our visit, Richard went out of his way to have the place spotless for our stay. He had complimentary groceries delivered in time for our arrival, and once more in the middle of our stay (fresh bagels! fresh whipped cream!). The bed was ridiculously comfortable. Shower pressure was incredible. A selection of Keurig every morning was a welcome indulgence. Location was perfect - an easy drive to the beach and to grocery stores and pharmacies, and walking distance to great restaurants on Washington. The neighborhood itself is safe and quiet. Whenever we messaged Richard, he would respond right away. We could not be more comfortable, and if needed, we would absolutely book this place again.<br/><br/>It should be noted that we were traveling with a dog and a toddler, both of whom enjoyed the backyard immensely. We really appreciated how babysafe the place was, as well. Thank you so much, Richard!",clean
"Richard's place is so lovely! Great location, clean, spacious and cozy. He's a great host who answers everyone questions quickly and very is informative. Loved staying in his place in Venice and highly recommend to anyone.",clean
"Michelle and Barry's place was absolutely perfect. It's located on a quiet street in the heart of Silver Lake, making it fairly easy to get to amazing food, sites, and the usual tourist stuff. The house was cozy, secluded, and welcoming. Michelle and Barry provided a gift basket with flowers and food. They have a beautiful courtyard in the back of the house with a grapefruit tree growing in the middle. There are beautiful flowers and fragrant plants and all the things that make southern California a special place. What sets their place apart, however, was the care and attention to details. We traveled with our 18 month old, and Michelle and Barry left out toys, books, and a pack-n-play. Honestly our son may have had the best time of all. We cannot recommend this place highly enough. We will definitely try to book it again next time we're in town.",location
"This place was soooo good and close to so many places on Sunset Blvd if you like walking. Hosts were great and responsive to questiona. Great book for local food and activities. Great for business travelling, a couple or even a family. Well worth the price and so many welcoming and pleasant touches. Good central location in Los Angeles for drivimg to sights. Will definately stay here again.",location
"This is an adorable space in a hip neighborhood. We were traveling as a family, and it was a great help to arrive and discover books and toys waiting at the house for our toddler to play with, as well as fresh fruit to tide him over in the morning. You may have to drive a block or two to find street parking at night.",location
"We absolutely loved Michelle and Barry's place.  It really is a home away from home, hidden behind the main house amid beautiful vegetation and gorgeous patio space.  We walked in after a super long day (8 hours on the road, 4 of them stuck at the Mexican border) to find fresh fruit, water, coffee, tea, muffins, etc.  What a treat!  Their place is roomy, clean, comfortable and cozy.  And it is stocked with anything you may need (soaps, toothpaste, tissues, even cotton balls!) And having a washer/drier on site was wonderful.  We traveled back home with all clean clothes! The location is spot on.  Right off Sunset Blvd., you have Starbucks and many great eateries.  And for some exercise, Echo Park Lake is 4/5 blocks away, perfect for some morning exercise.  There is not shortage of things to do or see.  Michelle and Barry lay everything out for you in their super helpful binder.  This is a real find.  As we have 3 young adults in LA, we will definitely be back.",clean
"Fantastic place with a great location, beautiful and very cozy yard. Hosts were great, quick to answer and very helpful.<br/>We loved staying there. A place I truly recommend.",location
"What a lovely place! Quiet and tidy, set off from the main road, cozy but big enough to sleep 4 comfortably, and in a very convenient part of the city for exploring Los Angeles. Michelle and Barry were thoughtful and generous hosts (thank you for the food!). We would definitely recommend this place to others and will be in touch next time we are in LA.",clean
"Michelle and Barryâs place was the perfect base from which to explore LA. Location was convenient and close to restaurants, bars, and grocery stores. We took an Uber/Lyft everywhere so canât comment on the parking, although they offered to give us the key to the garage so Iâm sure it would have been no problem. The apartment was filled with lovely, personal touches- including a bottle of wine, a ready tank of drinking water, and a box of delicious coconut pancake mix. Michelle and Barry thought of everything. My parents and I couldnât be more happy with their place and will definitely stay here again if we return to LA. Thank you guys for giving us such a lovely stay!",location

"Our stay at Michelle's & Barry was very pleasant. When we came we were greeted with a food basket, red wine and a folder with suggestions about things to do in the neighborhood and in LA. There were also instructions for the house. The house is a cute, little, old house with a moderately sized front yard. The neighborhood offers loads of nice restaurants, clothing stores and more. They were very clear that we could contact them if we ever needed anything. We recommend them and their house highly and if we were to go back to LA we would be glad to stay there again.",location
"This is a beautiful, quintessential California home. The house is very comfortable and welcoming. The property is just lovely from the comfortable outdoor seating arrangements to the luminaries hanging from the citrus trees. Michelle and Barry are perfect hosts. Everything went according to plan, and the lovely basket was filled with everything we needed to end our travel day and begin our first morning in LA. This really is a wonderful place. The little garage can in handy for convenient parking. We were in LA to visit our son, and we, very comfortably, shared the space. We had a wonderful stay at this delightful home.",location
"Michelle and Barry were excellent hosts, although we did not meet them, communication was quick and to the point. The house is a gem, super clean, tidy and has a most impressive outdoors, beautiful vegetation and flowers, lots of space, BBQ, giant grapefruit tree, lighting at night and steps away from Sunset boulevard. Extremely quiet. We could not ask for more. ",clean
"What a wonderful place! Beautifully situated near Griffith Park and Downtown, this home was an absolute pleasure to stay at. Michelle and Barry were kind enough to leave us some food (bananas, bread, peanut butter, jelly, milk and granola, and two San Pellegrino cans), which we thoroughly appreciated. The only minor con was cooling provided by window units which caused the apartment to be stuffy at times. Overall, we would stay there again in a heartbeat and loved every minute of it. As a side note, the guidebook was also quite helpful.",location
"Really special spot.  Lovely welcoming touches, like wine, and breakfast treats, from responsive hosts.",clean

"This location was excellent, we decided to move to this neighborhood permanently after staying in this Airbnb the entire summer. The house was a great home for this time for my wife/myself/our toddler. Very small hiccup on initial checkin with the lock code, we got ahold of Richard and he addressed it quickly, after which point we loved having the pin lock on the front door and miss it in our permanent home.   Richard was a great host and immediately addressed the small maintenance issues you run into with any 3 month rental.  The house was well appointed with all the amenities we hoped for, the listing accurate.",location

As mentioned in the posting there is slight street noise but it didn't really bother us too much. We also left the window open most of the time to keep the place airy.

"The apartment was perfect! It was clean and very well organized. Michael made sure that we were comfortable. It is near Venice Beach, Santa Monica, Hollywood, Malibu, Downtown LA...! ",clean
"We had a great stay at Michael's place in Mar Vista. Site description and photos are accurate. It's a true efficiency - space is tight! But we settled in there for 10 days happily, and there were drawers and shelves for storing our stuff. There's a Trader Joe's one mile away, and we stocked the tiny little fridge. We used the toaster oven but never turned the stove on. Enjoyed the balcony (which overlooks Venice Avenue, a moderately busy street) as well as the pool & hot tub! We borrowed bikes from local friends, and it's a straight 3.0 mile shot down to Venice Beach. Easy off-street parking in assigned spot. One morning we seemed not to have hot water, and the next morning we had to let it run for a very long time for it to get hot (which was a shame in the drought); not sure if it was related to normal demand in the mornings in the building or if it was a fluke. Free wifi in the unit worked well. Overall we had a great stay and would definitely consider staying there again. Thanks, Michael!<br/><br/>",location

"We had a great stay at Michael's studio.  It was just as pictured: small but intimate.  Perfect for what my wife and I needed.  Michael keeps a clean studio.  The studio is very close to Venice beach where my wife and  I would go have breakfast every morning and on Venice Blvd, which my wife and I later found out was a fairly easy boulevard to find.  Michael was very welcoming, our interaction was minimal, but that is only because the studio had everything we needed and we found no need to bother him with anything.",clean

The place made me feel comfortable enough to honestly and truly felt as though it was home and that I lived in L.A. (I should be so lucky) ",clean
Michael was super accommodating. I stayed with him for a week and booked my stay very late in the day. He made sure I had a clean and convenient place to stay once I came to town regardless of time.

"Cute cottage in a great location right on the Silver Lake/Echo Park border. The AC unit keeps the bedroom cool at night. Only downsides were there were a few mosquitos inside the house and the walls are quite thin so guests staying in the front house can sometimes be heard. But if youâre looking for a sweet, small place to stay, this is a good option.",location

Overall the cottage was very clean and had everything we needed. The need was comfortable but a bit creaky.<br/>The only major downside is the noise from outside. It's LA so the neighbors are very close and helicopters fly overhead often making it difficult to sleep.,clean

Nita was a wonderful host and very accommodating, and the studio itself was well-maintained. <br/><br/>Would love to come back soon!",location
Great location. It's right by good restaurants and shops. This place is a cute studio just like the pictures. Overall it was a good stay even though we were there only for a night. ,location
"Fantastic, stylish, relaxed space in a lovely central location. Would love to stay again.",location
"A very spacious one bedroom Craftsman guesthouse steps from Sunset Blvd in Silverlake. Stay there and BBQ or cook on the vintage stove.  It looks exactly like the photos!<br/>Michelle and Barry are great hosts who try to do everything you ask, a welcome basket on arrival and they go above and beyond with prompt communication. <br/>We would definitely stay here again when in LA!",location
Beautiful house with everything we needed and more! Michelle and Barry are great hosts! Highly recommend staying here! Short walk to some lovely places like echo park and some delicious restaurants!,location
The bungalow has everything you need. Great host. Very helpfull with everything. A very nice touch was the starter basket with some treats at the beginning.,clean
"The house is adorable. On top of that, location is amazing. There are restaurants, cafes, and bars all within a mile walking distance. I highly recommend staying here if you really want to be in the heart of LA.",location
"Michelle & Barryâs place was fantastic! Great location, easy access to public transport and also has a secure garage if you have a car. The cottage was lovely, very clean and great amenities. Neighbourhood was nice & safe to walk around. Sunset Blvd is close by which was great also! Communication with Michelle was quick and easy. Check In was easy too. Highly recommend.",location
The host canceled this reservation 16 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.,clean
Michelle and Barry were truly super top notch super hosts! Michelle is extremely responsive and incredibly kind. I honestly wish I could live there! I LOVED my time in the guesthouse and would love to come back in the future. I have nothing but good things to say about my experience with Michelle and Barry and the guesthouse. Thanks!!!!,clean
"Michelle and Barry's place was great. It's in an awesome location and is set back away enough that you have that ""oasis"" type escape at the end of the day. They were both super helpful with communications throughout the entire stay, would definitely recommend a stay in their home.",location
"Michelle and Barry made my 5 weeks in Silverlake seamless. There were a few special touches that already have me planning for my next stay. I was scheduled to check in late and they offered to pick up groceries. Oatmeal, granola, fruit, milk and coffee were waiting for me and  were a lifesaver my first few days. The bathroom was stocked with full-size toiletries and plenty of towels.  I was working remotely during my time there so reliable and fast internet was a must. There were a few days when the connection was poor (no one's fault) and Michelle immediately contacted the internet provider for diagnosis and they rushed out to remediate. From then on, no issues whatsoever. It was a cozy bungalow for one or two guests, I highly recommend to anyone considering a long-term stay.",clean
"We loved it here! Everything was just right including the location and comfortable home. It was great having our own garage and outdoor space (neighbors occasionally come out to do laundry but otherwise itâs private). Michelle was always responsive and accommodating. When we think back to our 3 months in LA, our memories will mostly be of sitting outside enjoying this little oasis.",location
"Michelle and Barryâs bungalow is fantastic. Itâs the paradigm of the LA bungalow craftsman style â super well appointed with all the amenities youâd need, and has an amazing garden! Their spot is in a great location, at the Silver Lake and Echo Park border so is walking distance to lots of restaurants, bars and shops.<br/><br/>Michelle and Barry were responsive and helpful hosts â able to answer questions and provide guidance/help as needed.<br/><br/>Overall, I couldnât recommend this place more! Itâs super awesome; Iâd definitely return!",location
"This place is such a gem! Perfect for both short-term and long-term stays. Michelle and Barry were incredibly welcoming, accommodating, and responsive. I definitely hope to stay here again the next time I visit LA!",location
Very attentive and helpful hosts. Great location for exploring LA.,location
"Michelle and Barry were wonderful hosts and made our first month in LA seamless. Amazing location - we walked most places - and the home is the best. Garage is a game changer, and the patio feels like an oasis. Highly recommend to anyone looking to stay in a quiet and cozy home right in the middle of the two hippest neighborhoods in the city - Silver Lake / Echo Park.",location
"Michelle & Barry is very nice and sweet, they provide all supports I need, the house is pretty and big, I had a great time there.",location
"Had a great stay here for a month! The place is super cute and exactly as shown. The courtyard is a lovely place to hang out, and the place is comfy and well-appointed. The kitchen had everything I needed to make simple meals at home. The place is also within walking distance or a short drive from tons of great restaurants and stuff, and the garage is great if youâre driving.",location
The hosts very helpful throughout our one month stay and had great facilities and kits to help enjoy the LA area. <br/><br/>The patio is beautiful and its a private haven in the city.,location
Michelle and Barry were very responsive whenever we needed to contact them.  The house is very comfortable for a long stay.  It has plenty of natural light and is quite airy.  It also has a courtyard that is a pleasant place to relax in.,location
"Spacious unit with a perfect location in a very walkable, hip area. WiFi was very fast!",location
"I had a great time at Josh's place. Himself and his partner were very warm and welcoming to me, super helpful and thoughtful and made me feel at home right away. I felt like I was just hanging out with long time friends. Not to set expectations for other guests but on the first night I was lucky enough to have a home cooked meal which was delicious! Things to be aware of with this accommodation: if you're driving, the driveway can be a bit challenging to get into, so I'd be cautious if you have a huge car/truck. If you're allergic to dogs, it's best not to stay here, but if not, Josh's dogs are extremely friendly! It's an older place so don't expect anything super flashy but that's what gives this place its charm, as well as the great host! Would definitely stay again. 5 stars!",clean
I met Josh in Ken when they visited my air B&b  in San Francisco they left a lasting impression on me. I was in LA only for one evening due to business but I found the house to be clean and a great work environment. The two of them are very accommodating. The house is just a short walk from the metro and is decorated beautifully. there are a few unique things about there home Live fish in the kitchen lots of humming birds on the patio and a piano which I truly enjoyed! Hope to see you all again soon,clean
Studio was just like picture and very clean. Apartment building is well maintained. It is important if you are a guest with a car to email car information ahead of arrival so that either Nita or Mark can meet you with a pass for parking car on street( I was able to find a parking place across from the apartment but I can imagine that other times it might not be as easy).<br/>If you are planning on staying more than a day and will be doing any cooking I think it would be important to contact Nita about what is available in the cooking area. I wanted to dry a glass but there was no dish towel to be found.<br/>Studio is centrally located and was very close to the Los Angeles County Art Museum .<br/>My text messages were immediately responded to (since I left the building at 8:30 in the morning and needed to give back key and parking pass I was worried if this might be too early- but Mark was down to meet me at a moment's notice).<br/>Definitely would stay again if I was in the LA area! ,clean
"Nita was a lovely host. I had everything that I needed. The place was charming, clean and just as described. The location was also perfect. I loved the charming, historical building. I really couldnt ask for more. I will definitely try to come back and stay again. ",clean
The area was good close to where i needed to  e an go and host was inviting  made sure I had a parking spot and everything was clean and free WiFi and apple TV were great !!. Im used to sleeping I the city as my apartment is an a busy area near a major train station . But if your not used to being in a busy area it could be a negative for you.,location
"Nita was extremely responsive, replying my messages to her within minutes, and she was very accessible. Everything from the keys to the parking permit for street parking was given to me in a very streamlined and professional process. As my first time using Airbnb, this was extremely comforting. The room was amazing. The best thing about this place isn't the beautifully decorated room or the amenities but the amazing location and the very reasonable price. You are surrounded by fancy cars and literally a block away from the big brand stores, yet you are paying an extremely reasonable price. This is a great neighborhood and I never imagined that such a place could exist for such a price. On one hand, I want everyone to know about this place but on the other hand, I want it to be available next time I try to book it! Nita and her studio seriously provided the best and most unimaginable experience for my first time using Airbnb, and I definitely plan to book it again next time I'm in L.A.",location
"I made a last minute trip to LA, and booked this stay with a friend. Josh was an exceptional host from beginning to end! He was so accommodating and so helpful in anyway that would make our trip in LA the best it could be. The location is so ideal and we never had a problem getting to popular ""touristy"" areas. If anyone is looking for a reasonable price,  to meet good people, and a positive atmosphere, I would highly recommend staying with Josh!!!",host
"This place is a home away from home. Or just home. Josh will go above and beyond for anyone. He is on call 24/7 and will be there literally at any time, day or night. This place is fun and feels like a family. Location is perfect. You'll be at the center of everything. All the rad neighborhoods are right around the corner. I have a cat and she was totally welcome. She also had a freakin' blast playing with the awesome dogs that live here. The room is gigantic with tons of natural light. Good medicine if you're ever in a funk. Do yourself a favor and book it.",location
"Josh was incredibly welcoming. He made sure the room was clean with fresh sheets and towels. He wanted us to be as comfortable as possible. However, we didn't realize that the room would be so close to multiple Airbnb spaces. The smoke from other spaces travelled into our room. ",clean
The stay was very great! We enjoyed the room and the vibe of the home! Josh was very friendly and doing everything to make us feel like home. We recommend him!,location
"Our stay at Josh's AirBnB was great. He's been hosting for a long time and knows what he's doing. The house felt super welcoming and had good vibes all around.  I would absolutely reccomend staying here..its the best Airbnb I've stayed at so far.  Great central location, close to lots of shops and restaurants.",location
"This was my first time using Air bnb, and I've got to say it was a great experience. Josh went above & beyond to make sure everything was good during my stay here. I really enjoyed staying here as well! Very spacious room & clean as well. Overall, I would love to return here, Josh made my time in l.a here unforgettable. Also, this house is located in the middle of everything, so it's really convenient! I would highly recommend this place to anyone else. ",clean
Great communication both prior to our arrival and during our stay. <br/>The location was superb- 5 minutes to Rodeo & 10 minutes to wholefoods. <br/>The apartment was clean & spacious. The bed was large & comfy.<br/>Great value & we would highly recommend. ,location
Really enjoyed my time here look forward to returning soon,clean
The place was really comfortable and clean. The hosts provided good communication ,clean
"We arrived earlier than our indicated check-in time and Nita was kind enough to accommodate us.<br/><br/>We only met Nita's husband, Mark, he was more than helpful. Mark met us at the front with our parking exemption and even offered to help with our luggage.<br/><br/>The suite is spacious, and the location is perfect! It is steps away from Rodeo drive so if you are looking to shop in Beverly Hills look no further.",location
The apartment was lovely and so clean Nd pleasant! I felt right at home and slept wonderful in the bed!! Very comfortable And great hosts!!! Plus location is great ,clean
"The studio was great! Plenty of great restaurants, bars, people watching...and if you like Barney's you can practically roll out of bed and be there. All kidding aside the place was great and as described in the listing and pictures.",location
Pros: <br/>Perfect location right in the center of Beverly Hills<br/>Big nice bedroom<br/>Park permit provided<br/>Responsive communications<br/>Apple TV with Netflix<br/><br/>Cons: <br/>Cleaning conditions could have been better<br/>Bathroom is old<br/>Cold welcoming,location

"After a long flight, Nita's place was refreshing to come ""home"" to. Bright, clean, inviting and steps from Rodeo Dr., I suggest this to any future travellers. We absolutely loved the historic building (especially the quaint elevator). Nita was very quick to accommodate us in every way :)",location
"Perfectly located in central Beverly Hills, comfortable and spacious accommodation in a charming old-fashioned building. ",location
"Very comfortable accommodations in a quiet and friendly building.  Lovely tree-lined neighborhood, but 10 minute walk from just about anything you could want. 24 hour drug store, amazing happy hours (recommend Cafe Roma) the best croissants this side of Paris (Chaumont) as well as any kind of shopping you can imagine.  <br/><br/>Internet was very good.  Bed was super comfy-- perfect 10.  Quick and strong hot water in the bathroom. Closet is hugs, so all our stuff could be stowed.  Outlets on either side of the bed. We really enjoyed our stay.

Perfect location. Walking distance from many restaurants and shops. Studio is very clean and spacious. Hosts were easy to get a hold of. ,clean
"I enjoyed my stay at Nitas place. It was great for two, bed was very comfortable, spacious and clean. The location was perfect, safe and walking distance to Rodeo Drive. I would definitely recommend this place and would stay again when back in LA.",location
"Very spartan studio. No homy feeling at all, nor hotel feeling; bottom line it is not a ""nice"" place. Location is something else, you are just a 2 minutes walk to rodeo drive. So, yes, location is absolutely great!<br/>Parking is mandatory to have a permit and Nita will work it out for you, which is nice.<br/>But returning to the studio, it has too many things to improve, starting for the cleaning (cover of the bed dirty with (too many) spots, the floor, the bath, etc. There are not even the essentials for a short stay (perhaps if staying longer it make sense) but forget to cook or even making breakfast, no kettle, no coffee maker, and of course no sugar, no salt, no nothing. I understand that if a kitchen is provided and I'm staying one or two nights it is not expected that I would shop like if I'm living there, detergent, salt, pepper, oil, sugar and (why not) tea and coffee.<br/>So if you just want a great location, with parking and just (and I mean JUST) a place to crush for the night, this might be a good option for you<br/>",location
"My wife and I had a great time in this very nice studio. It suited our needs perfectly, it had a great location for first time visitors to Los Angeles, and everything surrounding the reservation went incredibly smoothly. We would definitely stay here again and suggest anyone considering it to do the same. ",location
Wonderful clean apartment. Perfect location. Lots of walkable shops and restaurants. Brilliant hosts too! <br/>A must stay. ,clean

"Not having a local number, I was slightly concerned about not being able to reach our hosts. However, Nita and Mark were at the property ready when we arrived which was really good. We were led to the apartment straight away, given parking permit, keys, building security code and everything was nice and simple. <br/>We enjoyed staying there too. Location was ideal for us, pretty and quiet neighborhood only one block away from Beverly Hills golden triangle. And the apartment was much roomier than a hotel room. <br/>Nita was easy to reach via airbnb message or phone with regards to any issues we had. ",location
"Studio in Beverly Hills is a great location - short drive to pretty much anywhere you want to go. Parking in LA can be pretty tricky, but Nita and William helped out and we didn't have any problems. The studio was very clean and comfy. William was very helpful at check-in, and checking out was a breeze. ",clean
"The place was exactly as it described, beautiful place we loved how it was so big & spaced out, and we had a Bluetooth padlock for the door which was pretty convenient. You don't have to worry about carrying the key you can do it on your phone. The suburb we stayed at was really close to the main shops in Beverly Hills walking distance takes about 5 mins to walk out the street. Nice quiet place! ",location
This was a lovely studio and great neighborhood! I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and Nita was a great host. She was quick to respond to my texts and answer any questions I had.

"Location,  location, location!<br/><br/>This beautiful and clean space is in the heart of Beverly Hills which is also very close to West Hollywood (where all the major hot spots are located). The unit was clean and spacious and in a very safe building/neighborhood. Would recommend to anyone traveling to LA.",clean
excellent - cozy and compact but very roomy and fully functional. All necessities were there and Michael checked in frequently but non intrusively. Had an excellent time - there is also a Jacuzzi and Pool that are not mentioned in the description that I enjoyed frequently. ,clean
"I stayed 2 nights at Michaels place and it was an enjoyable experience. The studio looks just like the pictures. The bed is a pull out futon couch with a memory foam top - it's actually comfortable. There is a balcony attached to this unit if you feel like letting some fresh air in or sitting outside. The bathroom is equipped with a lot of products which is very thoughtful of the host- shampoos, conditioners, lotions, face washes, tanning oil, q-tips, etc. There were clean towels available. Kitchenette is also equip with glasses, utensils, microwave, mini fridge, etc. The wifi worked fine. Parking in the designated spot in the back is very convenient. Easy entry into the building and unit. You are off of a main street so you can hear the cars, but that didn't bother me. I wasn't able to check in until a couple hours after the time I wanted to (at 3pm) because the apartment hadn't been cleaned since the last guests yet, but I am to be refunded a small amount for the inconvenience, which I think is reasonable. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay at this studio and would rent it again. Thanks Michael. ",clean
"Michael was very helpful and accommodating. He offered us an extra heater when LA was uncharacteristically cold the day we checked in, though turned out we didn't need the extra heater. It's also nice to have the pool, the Jacuzzi and the laundry facility in the apartment complex. ",location
Overall I enjoyed my stay at Michaels. He was able to accommodate me on short notice and was very responsive. The place is just as pictured. The sofa was surprisingly comfortable and I slept well both nights. Only critique is the apartment is right on a busy street so the noise is a bit distracting at night. If you're looking for a affordable place to stay on the west side of LA I would recommend this spot. ,location
"Michael is an excellent host!! He was very easy to get in contact with. He made check in and check out simple. He wasn't bothersome at all but still checked in to make sure everything was good. Always a text away. The place was just as described. It had everything you needed. Towels/sheets, shampoo/conditioner, lotion, sunscreen, hairspray, qtips, plenty of toilet paper, paper towels, cleaning supplies, kitchen necessities - stove and fridge were great to have (although front burner did not work). There is a pool/hot tub. I personally didn't get a chance to use them but they looked nice! And you get a parking spot which was huge for me. <br/>Thanks Michael !!",clean
"An easily accessible studio, small but functional within short drive to Venice Beach. The unit faces a busy street, a consideration for the light sleepers. Parking is conveniently located at the back side of the building. The bed is plenty for one person but a bit tight for two. Michael was very responsive and a great host with clear check in directions.",location
"The room is quite big, clean & comfortable of course. You can always  easily access to Hollywood, downtown and lots of delicious restaurants in Korean town. At night it is very quite and secure. No bothering around.<br/>Josh is really good host! He is very friendly, nice and thoughtful. First day I moved in, he guided me a tour showing all the shops, coffee bars & retails around. And if he has time, he will cook lunch or dinner for us. Btw, the food he cooked is really tasty.<br/>Josh is always helpful when I need him. Next time when I in L.A., I will definitely choose this house and always looking forwards to meeting Josh again!",clean
"This was my 3rd booking at Josh's house and I can't recommend it enough. My room was clean and spacious with plenty of storage. The house always has an interesting mix of people to meet and hang out with. If I hadn't found a permanent apartment in LA, I would definitely still be living there. ",clean
"Michael's place is cozy and has everything that we needed. It is stocked with plenty of amenities. Very close to the beach and is in an area with plenty of restaurants. The apartment complex has a nice clean pool and spa, and we got our own private parking spot. Michael is very attentive and responded almost instantly to messages. Had a good stay.",location

"We had a fantastic time staying at Michael's place! It's located really close to Venice, Santa Monica and Abbot Kinney, and the bus to DTLA is right across the road. We weren't driving so it was great for us to be close to the bus. His place was clean and we had plenty of room for the two of us. The bathroom and kitchen were perfect. The bed was really comfortable, and we slept well. There is street noise but it didn't disturb our sleep at all. The pool and hot tub were fantastic, so quiet and always warm! Michael was easily contactable and very accommodating. I would highly recommend a stay at his place, and know where I will stay when I go back to LA! ",clean

"The place is just as advertised and Michael is very accommodating! Easy communication for getting into the place, answering questions if issues arise and check out was very simple! Thanks Michael! ",clean
"Michael is a great host. We had contact via messages as I landed in LA. As soon as I'd been at the building he sent me instructions how to check in. It was pretty easy! Inside the apartment was everything as promised. Everything was clean and in the restroom and in the kitchen was everything someone needs. At first I was afraid if it's loud outside at night because the apartment is on the street-side, but everything was quiet at night and I could sleep perfectly. The Beach is only 10 minutes by car away. You reach the highway in 5 minutes by car. Also supermarkets are only less than 10 minutes away. Everything you need is reachable quickly. When you have a question during your stay Micheal always answers your message quickly. I am going to come back for sure at my next travel to Los Angeles.",clean
"This is a great place to stay if you want to be in the heart of Beverly hills. It is very clean, beautifully decorated and practical.",clean

"The apartment was clean and exactly as advertised. Blocks away from downtown Beverly Hills (coffee shops and restaurants). I had a parking pass for my rental car, and only had a problem finding a spot on a Saturday afternoon. Every other day parking was ample in front of the building.  Would recommend highly for one person or a couple. ",clean
"Josh was a wonderful host. He immediately made me and my girlfriend feel right at home.

Best place to stay in LA ever!!!! Spacious room with huge king size bed!! Plus Josh is very flexible and always willing to help you!

There are several other renters at the house but if you are aware of that and don't mind it, this is a great place in K-town to stay!",location

Will stay here again. ",location

He greeted my friend and I right when we arrived, helped us with our luggage, and spent 20-30 minutes talking to us and giving us recommendations on what to do and eat in the area. The room we stayed in was spacious and more than enough room for two people. No private bathroom but that's no problem. He has a lot of friends so be prepared to meet some other friendly folks! And oh my gosh, he has three cute dogs!! Loved rubbing their bellies whenever I see them running around the house :)",clean
"Josh was the best host anyone could ask for. Super cool place to stay at! He was so chill & helpful during our stay! Such a welcoming house. We couldn't of asked for a better place to stay!

The room was spotless upon entry and the bed was very comfortable. <br/>Josh was a sensational host who was beyond accommodating. He had so much knowledge to offer about LA and had a long list of great restaurants to check out. <br/>I promise you will not find a better place to stay in LA. <br/><br/>P.S.<br/>His 2 dogs were the most well-behaved and sweetest dogs I have ever met.

This apartment was an easy location on a boulevard. Safe for a single woman. Down the street (opposite side at human crosswalk) the Cafe opens at 8am. Further down the street there was a farmers market on Sunday. The Japanese grocery store was also helpful. Buses are $1.25. The number 3 along Lincoln takes you to the airport in about 45 minutes. Easy access by bus to Venice Beach or Santa Monica.<br/>Bring you bathing suit as there is a pool.,location
"Michael was simply superb in communication and responded almost instantly to any queries we had. The room is in a very good shape and the bed is as comfy as advertised! Overall, the room has everything one would need and has exceeded our expectations. Highly recommended and we would stay here again if we were back in town again!",clean

Nice place! With everything you need at your disposal! Kitchen ns ,clean
Michael was the most efficient communicator and that alone is worth it. The place was close to everything I really wanted (Abbott Kenny/Venice/and a plethora of restaurants),location
Thank you Michael for your help. Our stay was very nice! ,clean
"Michael is SUPER responsive if you need any help! The place was as advertised and an awesome find. You're super close to everything! I couldn't have asked for anything else. It literally feels like you're going to a friend's place as everything you might need is there (lots of toiletries, everything in the kitchen, little fridge THAT WORKS WELL, plenty of towels, extra blankets, and etc.). SUPER COZY! Would highly recommend.",clean
Even thought we did not meet Michael he was very helpful and responsive via phone. The apt is in a good position convenient for beaches and nightlife. We believe bed was not comfortable and would not fit tall people. The house would need little manteinance here and there but nothing major. Finally it's an ok solution to get around.,location
"This is a really great little studio. The description is 100 % correct, and Michael is a really friendly host who's really concerned about the well-being of his guests! In advance of our stay, he was always extremely quick to answer any questions we had. The check-in is easy and uncomplicated (the check-out as well) and the reserved parking spot spares you from searching a space for your car on the street, which would have been quite difficult. And we just loved the studio!<br/>Venice Blvd, where the studio is located, is one of the bigger streets in Mar Vista, but the street noise is okay. After rush hour, it's just the normal noise that you'd have in any other city. The beach is very close by, you can even walk there, if you feel like it.<br/>Altogether, we can only recommend that you give it a try and see for yourself. If we should come to LA again, Michael's studio would be our #1 choice to stay.",location
Lovely flat in a very good area. Nita and her husband were very helpful. It was a pleasure to stay there and I would certainly do so again if I was ever in LA.,location
"Superb location just one block off Wilshire Bld., two block from Rodeo Dr. and the Beverly Wilshire Hotel.<br/>Host left us all the instructions to get around and important thing as: free parking and free Internet.<br/>Very confortable bed and very clean and well equipped studio.<br/>A great place to stay in one of the most desirable part of LA.",location

"We stayed in this lovely studio for 2 days because of its great location to do some sightseeing in LA. Jay provided all the details on how to get to the flat before, so we could arrive in our own time. We had a car, so Jay prepared the parking permit for when we arrived. It's on street parking and we always managed to find a space. The studio was as seen on the pictures with a comfortable bed and a big spacious wardrobe. We only used the fridge in the kitchen to cool drinks as we always ate out, so I can't really say anything about that. The studio was rather warm and doesn't have air conditioning. My husband was a bit too hot while sleeping, but I was fine as I'm not used to air conditioning anyway. The only other thing I was missing was a hairdryer, but Jay's looking into getting one.",location

"My stay in this studio was great. First, check-in was super easy. The keys and parking pass were waiting for me, and I was able to park on the street right outside the door. The location was fantastic. Walking distance to shopping and food, but in a very nice residential area with tree-lined streets, manicured lawns, and large single-family homes a block away. The apartment building itself was very clean and loaded with Mediterranean details. I saw a few other residents and they were well-dressed professionals. I felt very safe, which was comforting as a female traveling alone. The studio itself was just as pictured. Clean and peaceful. There was a mini-kitchen that I never used, large windows, and a neat 1950's style bathroom that was clean and functional. There is no air conditioning, but even though it was July, I was very comfortable with the windows open and the fan on, so I didn't miss the A/C. I slept like a baby, which was my primary goal. Overall, I loved the place, loved the price, and would stay again in a heartbeat.",clean

"A great location in a really interesting building. I felt very safe during our stay. It is unfortunate that our bed panels kept popping out from under us- after 2 nights of popping them back, we gave up and slept on the floor for the final 3 nights. On informing Jay on the situation- I received no response. ",location
"I did not actually meet the host however with a $25 fee he was willing to accommodate my request for an early check-in. The studio apartment was clean and as described. The windows were left open for air but the apartment was still a little warm due to no air condition. The host was very responsive, as I booked a same-day stay.",clean
"Nice leafy, tree lined neighbourhood. Definitely felt safe in the area. It's About 35 mins from the airport. <br/>The apartment itself was lovely, clean and spacious. I felt comfortable and at ease here. The host was kind enough to have the windows open for my arrival, which I kept open overnight to keep cool while asleep. The decor was simple and effective. The bed was comfortable with quality linen.<br/>Water pressure was ok, but the power was strange. I could barely power my hairdryer, despite almost no other appliances running in the room. Not sure if this is the norm here, as I've just arrived, but something quite noticeable all the same.<br/>I only have a couple very small criticisms, which are not a big deal - I would stay here again.",clean
"Well the host changed from who I had booked with so that was a little confusing.<br/>The area was great, however the stove didnt work, nor did the tv or the lift in the complex we brought this to the hosts attention and it didnt get fixed. also we didnt get the overnight car code for the 2nd night so were stressed we would get a fine.",clean
I didn't get to meet Jay but he left the key and parking pass as promised.  The room was clean and as pictured.  It was in a quiet antique hotel.  Beverly Hills is a quiet residential area.  The hotel wasn't far from acclaimed Rodeo Drive.,clean
"The apartment was very dirty! We found hair and dust everywhere.  There is no air conditioning and the ventilator was very stuffy. The elevator didnÂ´t work, so we had to carry our luggage up the 3rd floor. Jay was responsive with email communication and we had a parking pass. We didnât meet Jay but she left the key in the room. The room was in a very antique hotel, so you can smeel the time.  The room was cruddy and sand was on the floor. The hand soap was empty and we could not use anything in this roomâ¦uggh.  In the morning it was very very loud so we couldnât sleep.  It was everything else than comfortable! I would rather sleep in a hotel for this price!! I am very disappointed. Just horrible two nights there. Never again!!",clean
"Jay's apartment was a lovely surprise nestled so close to fashionable Rodeo Dve and Wilshire Bvd with its public transport. It was comfortable, ultra clean, bright and airy. There is no air conditioning should the weather be hot. <br/>Unfortunately the elevator was under repair which meant I had to haul my luggage up three floors. A good grocery store is about 4 blocks away. <br/>Jay was usually responsive with email communication. <br/>I would definitely recommend this apartment to family and friends. ",clean
"The location was lovely and very central. Clean and comfy -- a good home base, not great if you're planning to be inside on a hot day. (But who would stay inside if you're in L.A.?)  The host was super-prepared for my visit, and the instructions I got before coming were really detailed and helpful for a new visitor. ",clean
I was in Beverly Hills for the night for a couple of events I was coordinating and just needed a place to rest my head. Although I was only in the studio a short while it was great to have a clean and comfortable place to relax for the night. The building is beautiful and has an antique charm to it. Literally right off the main strip. Street parking only but there seemed to be plenty of spots available. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone Traveling to   Beverly Hills! ,clean

But for normal operational hours (get up around 7-8), etc. this is a great place to stay, and Joshua is super friendly and helpful. We only wish we had time to hang out with him instead of running around on our business errands :( Would book again!",host

"Mixed feelings on our experience here. Jay was fairly easy to communicate with. The location was fantastic .. Steps from rodeo drive which was convenient for the price point & was great that parking was included. The building looks pretty from the outside but it smells on the inside. The apartment itself was a good size, but I found it to be dirty, there was hairs on the floor /the bed/ the couch .. & the bathroom wasn't very clean. We slept on top of the sheets & the bed wasn't comfortable and had small pillows. Someone was knocking on door beside us at 8am for an hour ... <br/>Ultimately, If there was a new bed & a proper cleaning job done it would be a much nicer stay. ",clean

Me and my sister had a very good stay, and Michael is very kind and helpful! Super recommended!",clean
"Nine(9) missing vertical blinds was the only downside from calling this place perfect. The location & parking spot in back was ideal for our business/pleasure trip to LA. The bed was small but worked for my wife and I. After giving the patio chairs a good wipe down drinks were enjoyed out there while taking in the Venice Blvd traffic and nightlife. We couldn't get a signal on tv(Michael said there is only chromecast),so we walked a couple of blocks down the street to Boelero Mar Vista to watch game 3 of the World Series. All things (Website hidden by Airbnb) a cute studio,Michael was always quick with a response(via text) and we would stay here again.",location

The location is perfect because not far from the beach, not far from stores and restaurants, and also not too far from the airport or the two freeways so it makes it very convenient every time you leave the place to go somewhere. Thank you again!",clean
"The room was generally as listed: very convenient to LAX, not too far from downtown and easy in and out with check-in and parking. <br/>The room gets a lot of light especially in the morning, which is nice, although it would also be good if the host fixed the broken blinds, which were mentioned in a previous review several months ago. (Itâs also a little noisy as it fronts Venice Boulevard but thatâs life in the big city.) <br/>It would also be helpful to have instructions for booting up the TV, which connects to laptops, but otherwise Michael was a friendly and responsive host and also understanding about a booking mistake. On the whole it was a decent place to stay.",clean

"Jay was a great host with great communication pre and during my trip. The location was great, steps away from rodeo drvie and easy parking with overnight pass. I didn't need to stay at the apartment much during my stay, just to sleep. The only complaint/needs improvement was the bed. The ikea bed frame box spring slats kept popping out while sleeping or just laying in the bed. Multiple times i had to lift the bed to put the wooden slats back in. The mattress was way too soft for my liking as well. If the bed/box spring had more support, i would easily rate this a 5 star experience. ",clean

The living room and kitchen are shared so you will probably interact with other roommates, but they were all so nice and the environment was friendly and welcoming.  A small, unexpected pro are the many available jugs of water. It's weird that I mention this, but I really appreciated it because California tap water wasn't great.",clean

Itâs hard to believe that the blood stain on bed couldâve been missed if the sheet had been changed or properly cleaned. Parking was not easy as well. It was almost always unavailable throughout the day. We ended up paying for the parking on the other street. We had three night reservation but we checked out after one night, because it was very uncomfortable. It was our mistake overlooking the negative reviews before booking. I would not recommend this place!",clean

"Apart from the great location the rest was disappointing, all communication with Jay was 'sharp' with lists of what NOT TO DO, not at all friendly.  The apartment needs a bit of work, when showering the bath fills with previous peoples hair and scum (up past ur ankles) as it does not drain properly.   The top cover on the bed was dirty and unwashed and had the stale smell of  previous tennants, yuck,  a couple of decent pillows wouldn't go amiss either .  There was no airconditioning in the sweltering heat and strange child size cutlery, not enough plates, cups and glasses to organise a meal. We also had a neighbour approach us and ask if it was being used as an air b and b.  We did not know what to say as there was a DO NOT SPEAK TO THE NEIGHBOURS rule.",clean

"The location of this studio suite is incredible and it suited us well for our one night in Beverly Hills. Check-in and check-out was very easy, and we found parking right out front. Jay responded to my questions promptly and also assisted with getting an exemption for the parking permit since we had out-of-town license plates.",location
We have stayed here before. The studio was perfect for the weekend. It's conveniently located in Beverly Hills. The room is bright and airy. Jay is responsive and makes it very easy to come & go.,location
"Arranging for this stay was very easy. Jay was incredibly responsive and pleasant to work with. The listing includes the option of using a  parking pass if you will have a vehicle, so I let Jay know we would have a car with us and we were asked to provide the vehicle information before we arrived. It was also recommended that we reserve a rental car with California plates. The day of arrival the check-in details were provided early in the day. The location is great and there is ample street parking (see note below). Some feedback on our experience once we arrived:<br/><br/>Accommodations - Nice building, clean apartment, excellent location. The bed and 2 pillows are a bit worn but work perfectly well for one night. One thing to note is that there is no A/C. This is not something that is included in the description, I just had not thought to check for it so it came as a surprise. I am sure this is not an issue most of the year but during the summer months it is definitely a consideration as we were there on a particularly hot weekend. If you are staying longer term and plan on cooking, the kitchenette is very convenient as well.<br/><br/>Parking - As requested, we provided our rental car's information (with California plates) a couple of days in advance as soon as we arrived in town. The pass was left for us in the room and we didn't seem to have any trouble. However, the next day when we were leaving, we found that we received an expensive parking ticket after having parked overnight in a clearly marked location for permit holders (we triple checked the language on the permit as well as the signs). After check-out I contacted Jay to see if I could get some additional details regarding this situation as perhaps we misunderstood the validity of the permit. Unfortunately all of the responsiveness was gone. I still have not heard back from Jay and it has been two weeks.<br/><br/>All things considered, I would not say here again. I thought this was a nice alternative to the hotels nearby, but based on the accommodations and the added price of that parking ticket, I would opt for one of the nearby hotels for a short stay.

Place is centrally located and it is nice and clean! Josh's dogs are the best dogs you could encounter. Sweetest dogs ever!,clean
"Jay was incredibly quick with responding to any queries we had throughout our stay. The location was great, and we didn't have any issues with parking - although you need to make sure your rental car has California license plates. The room was basic, but it was clean, well presented and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. We would definitely stay again if we visit LA in the future.",clean
Josh's place is walking distance to a bunch of awesome restaurants in Korea Town. My girlfriend and I enjoyed staying here!,location
The house was super clean and everyone that I met during my stay there was friendly and respectful. I spent a lot of time in the living room watching tv since there wasn't one in the bedroom and no one seemed to mind or ever bothered me. I felt very comfortable and at home. Would definitely recommend!,clean
Room was nice and cold. Good area close to downtown la. Shared bathroom and hosts were helpful with suggestions. ,location
Great guy. Good spot.<br/>Good times,location
The most beautiful room i've ever stayed in.<br/>Joshua was a great host who s travelled a lot and shared some funny stories. Joshua's dogs were utterly lovely and sweet.,location
Host is so awesome and the location is really great. There is metro in 5minutes and Market and lots of resturants <br/>I highly recommend this place!,location

"Joshua is so kind, attentive and interesting to talk to. He woke up early every morning to make us coffee and was so sweet to my dog. The place was clean, spacious and lovely ",clean
Josh's home was excellent and he was a great host. Getting to know him was an unexpected enjoyable event.,host
"This was quite a last minute decision to stay with Josh bcos I was at the Ramada. I booked bcos i was attracted by the opportunity to spend time with host's dogs( cant have them in my place) and this stay far exceeds my expectations to the point that i did not want to leave!<br/>Josh is very accomodative to the early check in request where he tries his best to help all his guests check in as he understands the difficulty to estimate arrival time sometimes. His dogs are so loveable esp corma who loves the belly rubs and hugs as and when u see her. <br/>Josh's guests are very friendly and accomodating which is the true spirit of airbnb. I even got to make new friends through josh!<br/>Location is super safe and i was walking alone at night at almost 9-10 pm. Location is close to public transport(metro and buses) even though i believe most people drive in LA. I highly recommend this but keep a space for me next round, Josh! <br/>I am definitely returning to Josh's place. Had such a wonderful time and this really changed my perception of LA. Other than a raving review from my point of view, you have to try it to believe it. Thanks again for the kind hospitality.",host
Had an awesome second stay at Josh's house. Exactly what I wanted. Super accommodating. Thanks again Josh,location
"Josh was a great host! He was very friendly and provided great suggestions for activities - he offered to take us out and even made us breakfast one morning! I feel like Josh goes beyond being a host and tries to be a friend too. One note is that the bathroom for the King Room is shared with another Airbnb room, but overall a great experience. Will definitely be back if I'm in LA again :)",host
"Joshua has been an incredibly caring host and I wouldnât hesitate recommending his place to anyone looking for a place to stay in LA. The room was exactly as described. Clean, cozy, with a functional ac. His two dogs are incredibly friendly and very much add to the whole Airbnb experience. This is coming from someone who is never at ease around dogs. Roma and McKoy were awesome! <br/>P.s. in terms of accommodation, Joshua went out of his way to make sure weâre comfortable.",clean
Thanks for the nice stay! <br/>Joshua's flat share was very welcoming.,clean
"Great location in Koreatown and within walking distance of The Wiltern, which is the reason why we stayed here.  The Kings Lover room is  spacious and has nice king size bed. House is older and  walls are thin which can make it  noisy when people are arriving or leaving; other than that,  very much worth the stay due to its location.",location

"Yes, very kind host was very responsive to all my requests",clean
"The studio apartment had everything we needed for a short stay in Beverly Hills.  It is in a good area with a lot of shops and good restaurants.  The small but fully-equipped kitchen came in handy as well.  The only negative I found was that there was only street parking and if you have an out-of-state license plate, you will have to find a public parking garage to park your car in overnight.  Other than that, it was a great place.  Very private and convenient to many parts of LA.",location
Jay was great at communicating and this spot was perfectly located. Will definitely look to stay here again. ,location
I recommend Jay and the studio to anyone and everyone out there. Perfect location super clean and no hassle. Everything went  easy going. We will be back.,clean
"My wife and I have stayed in the ""flats"" of Beverly Hills on numerous occasions, but always in hotels; this was our first time with AirBnB in this district and Jay's apartment was a winner all the way. It's in a perfect location just west of the great restaurants on SoBev (do not miss Maude and Frida if you're into fantastic cuisine!) and just south of the big stores on Wilshire.<br/><br/>The apartment is easy to find; it's in a historic building and is spacious and nicely decorated, with a kitchenette, shower/bath and all the usual amenities. The iron with ironing board was a nice touch - you can't go out in Beverly Hills with crumpled clothing, can you? ;)<br/><br/>Jay was very responsive with communications and helped us with the parking, directions, check-in process etc. All in all this was a superb three night stay!",location
Home is exactly as shown in photos. Josh was easy to communicate with. Room was clean and had this old cute charm about it. Also got to meet a mastiff so that was a plus. :),clean

This was the best Airbnb I have ever stayed in. Josh made me feel at home and is incredibly thoughtful and generous.

I can't recommend Josh and his Airbnb more!,location
Great company and location :),location

"The room is huge! And the bed sheets were so soft and comfy. The shared bathroom was surprisingly clean everyday and there is no shortage of water /staple food in the kitchen. Josh was so welcoming and even invited us out one night. His dogs were the cutest and very friendly! The walls are thin and you can hear all the fun happening around the house, so that is something to keep in mind. Other than that my partner and I enjoyed our short stay and would enthusiastically recommend his home to anyone looking to stay in the heart of LA at an affordable price. ",clean
The location of the house is so good. Josh is very nice and helped us a lot on our trip. The two dogs at the house is very cute. The kitchen and the room clean and has everything we need. There are so many restaurants around and itâs also quiet. Itâs really a nice place~,location
"Our stay at The Adelon in Beverly Hills was terrific! The studio was exactly as described by Jay. Clean, with an eclectic flare, and conveniently located with shops/restaurants nearby.

Utterly charming. <br/>Host delivered as promised. <br/>Great location. ,location
The apartment was just perfect.   Loved the building as well!  Great location and exactly as it had been described.  Communication with Jay was fast and helpful.  ,location
Brilliant place right in the centre of Beverly Hills! Couldn't ask for a better location and host. Really enjoyed our stay - the apartment is small but has everything you could possibly need. ,location
"I so wanted to love this place. The location was great, walking distance to Rodeo Drive and all that has to offer. The charm of the old building was wonderful and the space (studio) was perfect for a short stay. <br/>Here's the reason I won't be giving 5 stars, not 4, not 3, not 2....it was filthy! I mean, I can't believe there is a cleaning fee!<br/>The wood floors can't have been swept or mopped (although there is a swifter in the closet), the hard jute rug had potato chip crumbs next to the bed, the comforter had hair and other unidentifiable particles on it, the only sleeping pillows were covered with pillow shams (not pillow cases) which leads me to think these are not washed when/if the sheets are changed. The white fabric shower curtail had disgusting black stains on it (several of them) and the bathroom rug looked like it hadn't been washed in quite some time. I would expect a clean rug to step onto after a shower but this was not clean. I was totally heebie-jeebied out taking a shower there. <br/><br/>There are no screens on the Windows and the blinds are covered in dust! You can clearly see the trail of fingerprints where you must touch the blinds in order to close them or the windows. <br/><br/>Something is going on with the bed, too. It's mushy and sinks in in certain areas.<br/><br/>I LOVED the building! I hated the fact that I slept so badly because I felt disgusted from the filth.<br/><br/>Note, Jay offered a future discount for a 5 star rating. I could never, in good conscience recommend staying here unless you have absolutely no concern about cleanliness. I took pictures but there doesn't appear to be a way to upload them. <br/><br/>My daughter and I have become frequent visitors to L.A. and we won't be frequenting any other of Jay's properties. <br/>",clean
"This is a clean, charming studio space within a beautiful building off of Wilshire Blvd and close to Beverly Drive and Rodeo Drive. It appears to be a mixed use building, airbnb rentals along with residents. Walls are on the thin side, so expect some noise. Great neighborhood, clean, safe, within walking distance to many shops and restaurants. ",clean
Super cute place! Perfect for 1-2 people. This is a great place conveniently located with a great price too. Will stay again in the future. Jay is very easy to book with as well :) ,location
"Everything went well. Room looked as advertised. Easy to get there, nice location. ",location
"We enjoyed a one night stay in this amazing location. The space is exactly as described and pictured. The building is cute and located in a fantastic spot close to Rodeo Dr and amazing restaurants. <br/>We had a rental car with out of state tags so it was recommended we park at Saks just across the street for $10. This was easily done. <br/>We loved the building design (old fashioned elevator was charming!), the easy access on foot to many of our desired things, and quick communication from our hostess. Only negative thing I can say is the pillows were a little fluffy for my liking- but the bed was great! <br/>Highly recommend this rental. ",location
"One of, if not the best, Air BNB we have stayed in thus far! Not only was the host friendly but he really made us apart of his home. Our pups enjoyed the company of his pups as well! We will be sure to contact him again once we are back in the LA area. Please book him, if not you are missing out!",host
Amazing space and great energy all around! Definitely a homey feel.  Which I love! Close to great restaurants you can try out that arenât closed so early! A major plus are the dogs! Super friendly especially the puppy! I would definitely stay again!,location

Great place to stay and great hosts!,location
"Super spacious and secluded room with its own little kitchen!! <br/><br/>I checked in quite late but Joshua was there to guide me into the home and help me get settled in. I couldnât have asked for a better host as he gave me tips to navigate Los Angeles as well as his local neighborhood. I felt at home! I will definitely return in the future.<br/><br/>The room itself has a private bathroom and kitchen as I mentioned which was just so cute. I was free to use the main kitchen as well but I prefer to eat privately which really made the kitchenette so convenient. <br/><br/>WiFi was fast, good air circulation and I met a couple other people who were staying in the home as well that I had amazing conversations with.<br/><br/>Overall amazing experience that only added to my time in Los Angeles. Josh knows everything about the city so it was great picking his brain. Couldnât have asked for better accommodations. 10/10 loved it!!",space
"Joshua is a GREAT host. I felt very welcomed in his home. Had a bit of a hiccup in the beginning but he handled it in a snap! He is very communicative and super attentive. Has a lot of tips on getting around the neighborhood. Internet is pretty good, I worked from home during the duration of my stay and was able to do large media transfers in the appropriate time frame. Also, working outside in the front garden was very chill and lovely. There are plenty of places to eat in the neighborhood but the kitchen and kitchenette are well equipped if you prefer to cook. Bed is comfy, shower is hot and the tv w/ the apple tv combo was clutch to work from a bigger screen when needed. All around I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and can't wait to return. OH! And best of all - MICKEY!!! What a great pup! She's the bestest fluffy girl ever! I can't wait to come back and visit again.",location
"After a full month of staying here, I think itâs safe to say this is by far the greatest Airbnb Iâve ever had the privilege of staying at. Josh was the greatest host who took incredible care of everything. Amazing food, amazing dog, amazing people, I couldnât recommend this place enough! I truly never expected to meet so many incredible people throughout my stay here. 10/10 would book here every time!<br/><br/>S.A.D.J.",location
Place was incredible! Great location and value!,location
"Honestly I wouldn't say this place was 5 stars. My biggest issues were the uncomfortable amount of stains on the comforter in the room. The T.V. Didn't work and the fact that there was no A/C, wouldn't have been so bad if it was a cold windy day. The room was so hot and stuffy, even with the windows open and can going, I felt miserable to be staying in Beverly Hills. <br/><br/>Other than that, the size of the place was fine. It looks just as it does in the pictures. Parking is about a 5 minute walk where you need to use the permit provided, so if you've packed heavy I would consider that. Jay communicates well when there are concerns and all in all was a decent experience. ",clean
"This was an exceptional AirBnB experience for me (and my pup). The hosts were welcoming, responsive to any question or need, gave me plenty of space, and were a pleasure to stay with.  The location is great & the off-street parking was secure and easy.  (Off-street parking in this area is gold!) The wifi was fast and reliable, the room was clean and comfortable.  I couldn't have asked for a better place to spend a month in LA.",clean

"Very responsive, charming building in adorable neighborhood. Convenient to Beverly Hills restaurants, west Hollywood nightlife",location
Historic-feeling building in a great and very safe location of Beverly Hills. Jay was extremely responsive to our messages and proactive in outreach as well. The place was a bit dirty from the previous guest but I think this may have just been a one-time oversight as this doesn't seem to be noted anywhere else. ,clean
It is easy to find this apartment. Jay is kindness and easy-going. It is a nice and clean apartment. Near restaurants and shops. But we didn't convenient store nearby.,clean
"We enjoy stay in Michealâs place, the location was everythingâs he said: 3 mile from Venice Beach, has a bus in front of the condo that takes you to Venice and Santa Monica and has a freeway near to go downtown and we felt safe.<br/>We stay without a car, so did everything by foot, bus or uber! Was clean and have all kichetnette stuffs!!<br/>But there was 3 things that let us upset:<br/>The curtins was in half (the window is for the street, so this make us a litlle bit uncomfortable, even being in 3rd floor, and was too hot because the sun comes up the window all afternoon);<br/>The bed was wierd (the mattress above was bigger than the sofa bed itself!!) and the Tv only have chromecast (and without a remote control during our stay.).<br/>Hope he can fix this things and have more people coming over!!",clean
Convenient West Side location.  Thrifty price. Felt safe.,location
"Michaels place was as advertised and very comfortable. <br/><br/>I just wanted to say that the only negative reviews I read about the place before going was that the blinds were broken and the TV didnât have chrome cast. Both these issues were fixed when I got there.<br/><br/>Parking spot was convenient, pool and hot tub are nice. Location is good, close to the airport and beach.",location
10/10 would recommend. Michael is great and the location is wonderful!,location

This place is as described by other people in reviews and as shown on photos. Nice neighborhood.  Many places around. A little noisy because of the road. We had no problem with the check-in. We had some issues with the amenities but Michael solved them pretty quickly. The bed was short for me thou. Thank you.,clean
Michael's apartment is a good base for sightseeing LA. The sofa-bed is quite comfortable. Michael also gave as some tips for bars in the surroundings to have a beer after the daily tourism. I would chose it again if I would come back to LA,location
"Michael was so kind and although the time was late to contact, i could easily get in touch with him;) thanks alot, the place is a few mins from venice beach so it's easy to go everywhere!  the place is also clean and there's a swiming pool that we could use too!

We stayed at Michaelâs place for two nights as we explored Venice Beach and Santa Monica.

Michael was a great host! Quick to respond. Pictures are accurate representation of apt and location is great! Would stay here again.,location
"I moved to LA and stayed here for a month while I searched for an apartment, and I can honestly say that I felt right at home the entire time. The place is clean, well-equipped, and in a great spot with fast internet. Josh was an absolutely incredible host who responded quickly, answered all my questions about LA, and really made sure I was taken care of. Everybody else at the property was super friendly as well. They also have a guest parking spot, so no need to worry about street parking. I got seriously lucky when I picked out this Airbnb and would definitely stay here again.",clean

You can expect a clean and comfortable stay with everything you would need available. Michael was attentive to every message and even accommodated my wife and I when we needed to stay an extra 3hrs after the original check out time.  Really couldn't have asked for a better spot or host. ,clean
Accurate description. Safe neighborhood. Great location..close to everything.  Overall a great value.  Would stay here again. ,location
This place was not what was shown. The mattress looks like it was picked up off the side of the road. The pillows are for decorative purposes only. The sheets and comforter were stained. The bathroom and shower did not drain properly. There was no hand soap. The bath towels were old and ratty. The neighbors are upset that it is an Airbnb. <br/><br/>Please listen to me when I tell you to not stay here. You can get a REALLY nice hotel in the area for the same price. If you're looking to party and pass out like a frat party you've come to the right place. <br/><br/>The host clearly does not live there and she is entirely unwilling to compromise. Her idea of compromising is telling us to use public amenities at the local hotels. <br/><br/>Do not waste your time. We left after our first night and went to a local hotel. ,clean

Place is in a nice residential  neighborhood, I liked the secure building and Jay's place itself was nice and clean.  ",location
Loved the location. Easy to get access and leave the place. Would come back!,location
"BEWARE!  Worst experience I have ever had on Airbnb.  Jay never told us about the Wednesday Street cleaning. We were find a $68 ticket.  When we told her about the issue, she tried to pretend like she had told us. Then we showed her the message thread where she did not tell us, and she  changed her story and said she did not want to put too much information in the ad because she was afraid people would not book her room.  Wow.  I think something that could cause a $70 ticket is pretty important to put on the listing. Or to even mention it at check-in would have sufficed.  We asked her to reimburse us for this large expense, and she ignored us from there on out.  The pillows were awful. They were extremely high and hard.  The shower was clean, but really gross if that makes sense. It had a lot of old set in stains.  We were abruptly woken up at 2 AM by an extremely scary loud noise outside. It was the street cleaning.  And there were noises throughout the night and in the mornings coming from outside. We had to sleep with it windows open because there was not air conditioning. This was our fault,  we did not clearly read the listing where it said no air conditioning.   But we figured everyplace has air-conditioning so this was strange.  Lastly, Jay sent a text message at eight in the morning at about our check out at 11. We found that very rude. She should have messaged us the evening before. Since we were sleeping in from a long evening, the text message woke us up.  She went through the trouble of messaging us when she didn't have to, we knew to check out at 11,  but could not send the same courtesy for the parking outside.  The place is not a five star by any means. It smells like mildew you when you walk in.  Worst experience. ",host

Great location close to venice beach with nice balcony.,location

Studio was very clean and tidy! Pool and jacuzzi were a plus! Only thing was there is no air conditioning and the fan wasnât very powerful so it got pretty hot for me.,clean
Great place to stay for easy  bus and scooter access to Venice Beach and Santa Monica. Really cool courtyard thing with a pool and hot tub. Really comfy bed. Cute little patio.,location

"Fantastic location, walking distance to restaurants and shops.  The neighborhood and building are wonderful.  <br/>The amenities are sparse but the apartment is a bargain. <br/>The bed and pillows are in need of an upgrade.  Bring your won pillows.  A list of how to operate the TV and heating system would have been helpful.  Overall an OK stay and certainly a value for the neighborhood.",location
"Had a great one night stay, very easy and great value.",location
"<br/>So charming...LOVED the beautiful historic art-deco building and the neighborhood is very well situated, quiet, safe and green...<br/><br/>Jay was responsive and helpful though this was an extremely last minute booking fairly late at (Website hidden by Airbnb) was great to pull up and have parking etc handled. <br/>",location
"Great location, vintage building with tons of character. Host is great at communicating and giving suggestions. Perfect location for shopping/restaurants. Overnight parking was a slight challenge due to local/residential restrictions. Otherwise, perfect cozy place for a getaway.",location
"Josh and Ken were really friendly hosts and the place was wonderful.<br/>The location is great because the house is really close to the Wilshire/Western station and Ralph's is also very near. The room was really clean and tidy exactly as shown in the picture and pretty spacious. It was much better than cheap hotel rooms I used to stay. The kitchen was also very well equipped so I could cook easily for my self. The bathroom was also clean and had nice fragrance.<br/>The first day I arrived at the house, Josh was very nice to help me with moving my baggage and stuff. And he showed me the house and explained everything very kindly. At night, after I came back from traveling, he welcomed me again with some wine and we had fun talking about ourselves and the traveling.<br/>Josh also runs another place near the house and I could also become friends with other guys and they were also very nice. <br/>The day I left the house, Ken gave me a ride to the union station. <br/>Overall, I really liked the house and enjoyed the stay. If I visit LA again I will definitely stay at the house again.",clean
Cozy place in amazing location!,location
"Location is great! Jay is very responsive as well... i would say value for money... would choose this place again. The only thing that i hope could have been better are<br/>1. Better pillow (seems quite like a consensus view)<br/>2. There was no soap/shampoo.. o well there were empty bottles, lucky that i usually bring my own when i travel<br/><br/>But location always matter more for me, so a gd place to stay",location

Jay's place was as described! Quaint studio. Great location close to Rodeo Drive. Easy check in and check out. Would recommend for a single person or a couple. ,location

Nice little apartment close to everything in West LA,location

Great communication ,clean
"I loved the location with rodeo drive just around the corner and urth cafe, physique 57 and whole foods in a 10 minute walking distance. The Appartement is nice and very retro European style. Only thing we were missing was a second sleeping pillow and some knifes in order to prepare some food, or at least cut some lemons:) Jay answered always straight away when we had any questions. The parking in front of the house was very much appreciated ! Thank you so much!",location
"Jay's place was in a great location for restaurants and shopping, as well as a kind of secluded quiet neighborhood.",location
"This building is a very quiet building in a neighborhood that's walking distance from all of the Beverly Hills high end shops and restaurants. We never had an issue finding a close parking spot to the apartment- which was awesome. <br/><br/>The only downside was how loud the neighborhood was in the morning. The apartment is on the 3rd floor of the building and there's no air condition in the unit, so we slept with the windows open to keep cool. The quiet nighttime streets of the apartment transformed into loud streets in the morning- fast revved up cars, trash trucks, lawn mowers. There was no sleeping in. I wonder if it wouldn't have been as loud had we slept with the windows closed. But we were just too hot in the unit with the windows closed. <br/><br/>I mentioned already about the initial communication issues with Jay but overall, it was a nice stay. ",location
"Michaels place was in such a awesome location. Just a few miles from Venice Beach and located in a quiet neighborhood. I felt completely safe and the convenience to local shops and restaurants was awesome. There was even a market , gas station, and bank within a mile or two. So all the quick necessities was close by. I fell in love with an ice cream shop down the road called Small Batch. Blueberry pie was my favorite! Michael was a great host and responded so quickly. The place was clean. It did get a little warm throughout the day but we just kept the doors and window open and that worked out just fine :)",clean
"Josh's warm welcome began immediately upon my arrival. He made sure I had secured parking on the driveway, offered to help me with my bags... And walked me to my adorable private bedroom (with a fabulous walk-in closet) where there were fresh towels and soap awaiting and a cute decorative candle lit! He and Ken were extremely hospitable, always making sure that I felt comfortable and safe. My little Busby was just as welcome and comfortable as I was -- Josh and Ken are dog-lovers to the max, which made me feel even more at home. I'm a pretty busy person when it comes to work, so it was nice just being able to come ""home"" and sneak away to my bedroom... And other times it was great hanging out on the outdoor patio with a glass of wine. Internet never failed, the kitchen was accessible, and the yard was enclosed and secure for the little pup to play fetch with Josh's two dogs. Overall, the house was very clean, charming, filled with happy energy and I highly recommend this house to other travelers and people on the go! Just a quick tip to future guests  -- when it comes to the shower, the right knob is hot and the left knob is cold :)",clean
"Michaelâs place was awesome! My boyfriend and I felt very comfortable and cozy. Check in was fast and easy, location was very convenient for all the places we wanted to try out in LA. Personal parking spot was a great thing to have! We also tried out the pool and jacuzzi and even met a couple of friendly people and their dogs. Michaelâs studio was very clean and had many toiletries. There is no AC but we just used the fan and opened the door to the balcony which helped the place get cooler. Definitely recommend staying at his place!",clean
"This was such a blessing to find as it was a last minute booking, literally the day before.<br/><br/>Despite there being no air-conditioning, I was out most of the day so it wasn't an issue since I always came home at night to a cool room, plus coming from the islands, I'm already used to just using a fan and open window when necessary. <br/><br/>Aside from that, location was nice, close to the beach. Plenty of amenities plus the building had a pool and laundry. Spent my 2nd day on a hop-on/hop-off tour which made two stops at Venice beach making it very convenient to get on in the morning and get dropped off at the end.<br/><br/>Michael was so helpful and responded quickly to any questions I had regarding the space. Definitely perfect space for single to two-person travelers.",location
This place was amazing! It had everything we needed. Bathroom a bed to sleep in and a little kitchenette  that had a little oven microwave  hotplate and a min fridge. He also provided things like shampoo condition hairdryer toilet paper I can go on for days you are 100 percent taken care of guys! The place is super duper clean with a TV you can watch Netflix with and a pool and jacuzzi!! We (me and my wife) were thrilled to stay here. It's close to venice beach and everything else we did. We 200 percent recommend this place. Michael was amazing and answered ALL of our question. Enjoy your stay guys you eont regret it!,clean
Michael was extremely quick to respond whenever he was needed! Highly recommend,clean
I stayed at Josh place for 2 weeks in March and it was wonderful. Josh is probably one of finest host you can find in terms of making the effort to make your stay pleasant. The room itself is functional and the bed is comfortable. There are few other airbnb guests in the house and they are all wonderful. The location is safe and convenient. If you need to go to downtown it only takes 10 mins on subway. Overall highly recommendate if you need a convenient location with comfy bed and meet new friends. Good job Josh.,location
"Awesome! I had an amazing stay with Josh and Ken! There's also other  Airbnb guests, they're truly wonderful. The room was nice and the bed was comfy, there's a closet. Everything was clean and neat. I was introduced to really good coffee, thanks Josh =). If you have a car you can park in the drive way which is a plus! You can also walk to many places, the house is close to many things. They are willing to help you with anything so don't be afraid to ask. If you want something centrally located ....Stay with Josh and Ken! friendly. I'll see you guys again =). Thank you for everything! ",clean
Josh was absolutely amazing! I came for my birthday and it was a perfect spot for everything I wanted to accomplish while visiting LA. The room was just enough for myself and the house was spacious. Josh was almost willing to show me around LA since it was my first time visit and I'm so grateful! Anyone would be lucky to stay with Josh. I highly recommend it!,location
"Had an amazing time staying at Josh's place. The room was big, comfortable and looked exactly like pictures. The neighborhood is really quiet and convenient - close to grocery stores, few cafes and public transportation. Josh was an amazing host, eager to help with anything. Definitely recommend! ",location
"Josh, Ken, and everyone else I met have been amazing. I frantically booked a week ago because my original place to stay fell through . Within minutes he messaged me back and I was able to book. He is also pet friendly and welcomed my kitty, which was difficult to find when I was searching for a place. There are not enough adjectives to describe how welcoming they all made me feel. The house itself is very quaint with a nice rustic feel. Its close enough to be in the city, but at the same time you aren't surrounded by the crazy LA traffic. Its a wonderful place to destress after a long day out. Josh continues to improve his place, and is so accommodating - he even moved my car for me multiple nights so that I can easily leave to go to work at ungodly hours in the morning. If i ever need a place to stay in LA, he will always be my first choice as long as he isn't fully booked. Its like staying with family when you are with him! :) ",location
"Michael's place was very convenient location, close to Venice beach with either a quick Uber ride or about a 10 min bus ride with bus stop right outside his place. His communication was amazing and was very quick to respond and also gave me recommendations for local hot spots. The only downfall was the place wasnt as clean as expected. There was dust built up in every room and the shower faucet knobs had some slippery build up.",clean
Michael was really communicative and helpful. He was quick to answer any questions we had.,clean
"Really great value for the location! The apartment is small but has everything you need, and the included parking is really a fantastic plus!",location
"This airbnb was fantastic! Perfect for 1 or 2 people! The building the room is in was so quiet and calm. The parking space was definitely a plus, and the cool breeze that came in from the ocean was perfect.",location
Better than you would guess,clean
Good value in a nice location. Comfortable and clean as well. Can be a bit noisy as the apartment faces a busy street,clean
"This is a nice space for one or two people. The place was very clean in a secured building. There is a balcony with a nice view, the location is not far from the beach or other activities at all. Good wi-fi. Michael is a solid host!",clean
"I was in town on business and really enjoyed my month long stay. Easy check-in, Good location and a super comfortable bed. Iâm looking forward to staying again when Iâm back in LA. Thanks Michael!",location
"I would recommend Michael's place. Michael was very responsive (he usually responded within minutes), and flexible with the dates of our stay. Overall this place is a great value given the location, and that it has a dedicated parking spot. The apartment is cozy, and has a super comfortable bed. It's best suited for one to two people. Also, during our stay there wasn't a kitchen sink. This was a bit inconvenient since we had to use the bathroom sink to clean our dishes, but would not be a problem if you aren't planning to cook much. Also, there are many dining options nearby.",clean
"Michael's place was well-located and close to both the hip areas in Culver City as well as the beach. My only suggestion for improvement would be to invest more into the cleanliness of the unit - the bedsheets had a musty/old smell, utensils weren't properly washed, and the sofa had stains. The TV also wasn't working and didn't work/wasn't remedied for the entire duration of our stay. Also, be aware that there is no sink in the ""kitchen"" area so dishes will have to be washed in the bathroom sink.<br/><br/>Other than that, not bad and we do thank Michael for his hospitality.",clean
This is a small studio apartment in an apartment complex.  The building has an assigned parking lot for a car (though you need to find a street parking for 10 minutes before you get the keys).  It is located near Venice blvd with a bike lane that is convenient enough to ride a bike to the beach or to mid city.,location
The place was great. I stayed for about 3 months for a work trip. It was generally quiet and the neighbors were nice. I loved the gated parking and having on-site laundry. I just wish there was a kitchen sink. I would recommend it for fairly short stays.,location
"Michael was a great hostâalways quick to respond! The area is lovely, which is reflected in the priceâvery close to list of restaurants and the shore. The laundry on-site was also a big plus and the balcony was our favorite part of the space! There is also a great pool and hot tub for guests to use as well. Thank you Michael :)",location
"We were disappointed with the condition of the air bnb. It wasn't as depicted in the pictures and not worth what we paid. <br/><br/>- There is no hand soap in the rooms<br/><br/>- The wooden support slabs under the bed are all broken, falling off, or poorly attempted to be replaced. <br/><br/>- The bath tub was dirty<br/><br/>- The front door knob doesn't lock<br/><br/>- The bed is old (you can feel the springs) and worn out<br/><br/>- The sheets are old and don't match images on your post",clean

Jay was a great host. She answered all my question in a timely manner and her place was very clean and in a great location.,clean
"I had an amazing stay at Josh's place! It is the ideal AirBnB experience for the right traveler. It combines the friendly, it combines the privacy and comfort of a studio with the adventurous outgoing vibe of a hostel.<br/><br/>Josh went above and beyond to be an accommodating host. When I arrived I mentioned that I needed a place to get some work done during my stay... 40 minutes later Josh had built me a vintage chic desk out of wood he just had lying around that would make any hipster envious.<br/><br/>The house is located in a great spot just a few short blocks away from tons of great food (be sure to get some AYCE Korean BBQ) and a short cheap Uber ride away from all that LA has to offer.<br/><br/>During my short 1 week stay I shared a round of drinks with a whole cast of interesting characters. A mix of both long and short term guests including everything from a navy veteran, to a professional skateboarder videographer, to a writer from Indonesia working on a book, to a traveling nurse working at the nearby hospital (the list goes on). One day I walked out into the main hose to get an extremely strong (seriously, watch yourself) cup of coffee and was privy to an impromptu photo shoot that seemed to have broken out in the living room.<br/><br/>Realistically, you could probably just hunker away in your room coming and going, and never even notice the crazy shenanigans going on around you, but you would be doing yourself a great disservice.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that I didn't actually get to see all that much of LA since I was so preoccupied with what was going on at ""home"". Oh well, great excuse to take another trip... I know where I will be staying when I do!<br/>",host
Josh was AMAZING!!! He was super helpful and responsive to any issues that I had during my stay and also even recommended a few residences to check out as I am looking for permanent housing.  The cute little back house was clean and private.  I would DEFINITELY recommend staying at this spot.,clean

"I canât say enough about how happy I am that I found this spot. Josh was super helpful and replied immediately to my inquiry even though it was late at night. I needed a place last minute and he really saved me! <br/>This is better than a studio, with a bedroom(two beds!), living room, and kitchen. The laundry was just a few feet from my door. Josh was awesome and I felt like a friend immediately.He knows a lot about the city and will help you with any recommendations you need, Definitely book this place if you can. Iâll be back for sure.",location

"What an incredible and satisfying experience this has been! This studio has class and warmth. Our hostess Anna was most generous and hospitable, she made us feel at home, yet we felt we were on vacation at this quiet and beautiful studio full of perks (bottle of wine was waiting for us when we arrived and the assortments of teas was out of this world, so much attention paid to details...).<br/>Both my wife and I are professional musicians, we have traveled the world and this enchanting private studio had an artistic aura which is rare. It has everything, comfort and class! This will be a place for us to revisit again and again and again, to recharge ourselves. Don't look any further, if the dates are available, book it!!!",location

The bed was fabulously comfortable -- my first afternoon there after flying from Washington, DC I took the best nap ever!  Anna is a gracious, generous host.  She makes sure her guests have whatever they might need -- plenty of towels, an iron and ironing board, cleaning supplies, laundry detergent, coffee maker, dishes, pots and pans -- you name it, Anna has thought of it!  She also provides healthy snack foods and a bottle of wine which was so appreciated after a long flight.  I would definitely stay at Anna's again and recommend it without reservation.  Thank you, Anna!",clean
"This was the perfect place to stay for a long weekend and has everything you could possibly need for a longer visit. Anna was quick to respond to my request to stay and remained available before, during, and after our visit. She made the home so comfortable and inviting and went way above and beyond by providing fruit, a bottle of wine, cheese, and a variety of snacks when we got there. The bed was very comfortable and the fireplace was a nice touch. There were big outdoor chairs to sit and relax in and the area was so quiet and peaceful. Parking was easy and the area is beautiful and safe. Washer/Dryer is in the unit, small touches like the tea selection were completely unexpected bonuses. There are a lot of great restaurants nearby if you chose to eat out and a kitchen if you want to stay in. I would definitely stay here again, overall it was such a relaxing and peaceful place a wonderful experience. Thank you Anna!",location

"The location was excellent in that it is a short drive to just about anything you could want in Glendale. If you want a quaint street full of restaurants we recommend Honolulu Ave. in the nearby (5-6 min drive) area called Montrose. The Americana Mall and Glendale mall are maybe a 10-12 minute drive. There's a Whole Foods market that's only a 5-6 minute drive. Glendale itself is in a good central location in LA with easy connections to all that LA offers. There is a park with softball fields that is a very short walk from the house, maybe 5-6 minutes. Across the street from the park there is a very nice local grocery store. All in all, the location worked very well for us. The apartment where we stayed was next to the host's house, just on the other side of the carport. I guess you could call it a garage apartment or a cottage. Anna's pictures show it very accurately. It's very comfortable and well equipped. She has supplied just about everything one could want there. The bed is very comfortable- we slept well. The neighborhood is ultra quiet except when the yard man comes once a week and uses a leaf blower for a short while. The cottage and the grounds are extremely well maintained. It is as clean as can be- I'd say 10 out of 10 is how we'd rate it for cleanliness! The bathroom is great and the water pressure excellent. The hot water never runs out because its a tankless water heater. The kitchen is the nicest we have had in the many places we have stayed. It's got everything you need to do all the cooking you like and the fridge is a good size. With the skylights, the place is very bright even though we had our share of rainy days. Anna responded quickly to any need that came up. She is an excellent host! We would love to stay there again. ",location
"Anna's rental was amazing! A bright and open space and stocked with more than I could need during my stay. The property is quiet and private, I spent many days in her hanging chairs and in the lawn.

"We stayed in the guest house for a week. It was basic but perfect for our needs. We left early in the morning and came back very late at night, so we weren't really there long. The space consists of a bedroom with two queen beds, a living room with two sofas, some small tables and a TV, a walk-in kitchen and the bathroom. We essentially just needed a place to sleep, make some coffee in the morning, shower and change, so it worked out great for us. Joshua was super nice and very helpful in offering tips or advice on places to go for dinner or things to see, or helping with some little things we needed. Also, a BIG plus, parking is on the property so you don't have to worry about trying to find street parking, which is nearly impossible in the area. The driveway you're parking in is single-car width and since Joshua does also rent a few other spaces there, some car jockeying is expected, but Joshua will do it all for you, which was great. Right outside the door to the different spaces is a small courtyard. At the time there was only a table there, but some pics showed chairs as well. It would be a nice spot to enjoy coffee in the morning, or a drink or two at night.",space
"I have stayed with Josh each of the last three summers. I keep coming back because he always gives the best recommendations, treats you like family and has the best dogs... Mainly for the dogs.",location

"We stayed at Anna's place during a visit to see family and friends in the LA area. It was a perfect place to stay, and we so appreciated all the lovely extra touches, including all sorts of delicious treats! It was so nice to stay at Anna's, we didn't want to leave - and we would definitely go back another time. Thank you, Anna, for your great hospitality!",location
"Clean, comfortable, very quiet, only the birds woke us up in the morning.  Anna was a great host.",clean
"I stayed at Anna's for about two months while I was interning in Pasadena. It is a perfect little place for one or two people to stay! She provided nearly all cookware and utensils you could ever need to prepare a meal - I cooked for myself quite a few times a week! Very safe location and very near to a nice shopping area (The Brand & Americana) with lots of food and activities, especially hiking, and not too far from other things, like beaches and downtown. Exactly what I needed for my stay in Los Angeles!",location
Anna is incredible. Her place is spotless and could not have been more comfortable. Everything is updated and modern. Her attention to detail in the apartment was outstanding. It really felt like a home away from home. I look forward to booking with Anna again in the future.,clean
"Annaâs place was quiet, super comfortable, and had the best stocked goodies Iâve ever had at an AirBnb! We were in town for a friendâs wedding and the location was perfect. The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen had everything we needed including plentiful snacks and wine. There is also a washer and dryer and plenty of storage space for clothing. Anna is a very generous AirBnb host and Iâll definitely be staying here again if I return!",location
"Anna is a lovely host. We had a great time. The little house is charming and has everything you need.

Anna provided an amazing place to call home for a couple weeks as I transitioned to SoCal.  I was pleasantly suprised to discover the vast spread of amenities available to me and was incredibly grateful for the snack basket and fridge treats.  Anna provided great hospitality and communication; she made me feel like family.  Such a beautiful location and environment; I loved waking up to the birds chirping.  Thank you for a wonderful experience Anna!,location

There is absolutely no way you can go wrong with this Airbnb!! Anna was amazing the experience all around was A1!!,clean
"Anna is a very thoughtful host who leaves snacks, wine, tea, and coffee ready for your arrival.<br/><br/>The place is private with a very efficient heating/cooling system.  The Smart TV is ready with Netflix and Amazon Prime if you have time to sit and relax while you are visiting.<br/><br/>If you are staying longer, there is a washing machine/dryer right in the unit.<br/><br/>I would recommend Anna's place to anyone, for a night or a month.",clean

"Anna's place resides in a quiet neighborhood which offers ample free street parking. The interior is beautifully decorated, clean, and had various amenities that a traveler may need during their stay. She provided us with a bottle of wine and an assortment of snacks which complimented the wine. Her check-in instructions were very clear, which made the whole process easy. Additionally, we had privacy throughout our stay, although she made it clear that she was available should we need anything.",clean
"I made this booking for my mother, who was in Glendale on a family visit.  She had a warm, in-person welcome from Anna who followed up after her check-in to make sure she was comfortable.  My mother found the studio to be convenient, spacious and secure with excellent amenities and snacks provided by Anna.  The studio has as washer/dryer, which she also found handy during her visit.  Overall, she had a very comfortable stay and I would book Annaâs studio again for her without hesitation.",clean

"The place is perfect for a light traveler who focuses on exploring within the confines of Downtown LA! Everything is close by, McDonald's is just two blocks away and Ralph's supermarket three blocks! As a motorcycle rider (although I was with my family [6 ppl] in a minivan this trip) it's perfect for an overnight pitstop! The size of the room is generous, the beds are supportive and the sofas are supple soft! There are many extension cords for your electronic goodies needs!<br/><br/>The community within the area is tranquil quiet despite being in the hustle-n-bustle district within Koreatown! The street may be narrow but it's part of its charm, and Joshua offers a free parking on his premises!<br/><br/>Joshua is a very approachable person! Highly attentive, and very hospitable! He did an awesome job preparing the place for a huge party like us. <br/><br/>I will definitely return to this place again! Highly recommeded!",location
"We were very fortunate to be able to book the guesthouse at short notice. The location was great. We were able to walk to some really great restaurants in Koreatown. We were also very happy that we were able to do laundry right outside the guest house.<br/><br/>My overall experience was ok. Communication through the Airbnb messenger was very slow., and the check-in instructions were very vague.<br/><br/>The cleaniness of the place was ok. It made me feel like we were staying in a fraternity house though. The walls were thin so you could hear people outside/next door.<br/><br/>We also encountered an ant problem in the bathroom and one side of the bedroom (closest to the door).",location
Comfy rooms and great location! ,clean
"Anna's studio was so cozy, warm and comfortable that it felt like home.  She had for us some really cute welcoming items and other special touches.  Anna was quickly responsive when I had a question or a need.  I don't think that there isn't anything I can suggest as Anna is doing an outstanding job as a host and the way she maintains the studio is exceptional.  I would recommend this studio for anyone as it has absolutely everything needed while traveling.",host
"Amazing Airbnb! Itâs on a quiet street off a busy one so our nights were quiet. Anna was an amazing host, always quick to answer any of our questions.

If you need any help finding anything to do, Joshua will take care of you. The place was great, location was great, and dealing with Joshua was awesome!",location
"This is a detached guest house in the back-yard, not very big but quite enough for 4 people. The location is great in central LA, several good Korean bbq places near-by, less than 30 minutes with traffic to Universal Studios which was our main activity. Can recommend it for a place to sleep while vacationing anywhere in LA. There is off-street parking!",location

All of the amenities one could wish for! Anna is a great host.,clean
"This will our second time using the Airbnd and so far is not bad at all.  We stood at Anna's place and it was a nice cozy guest house and we loved our stay.  We stood from 10-08 - 10-15-21 visiting our son. When we arrived, we were hungry and we were so happy to see plenty of snacks, that was our munchies until our dinner.  Any questions we had Anna was there to answer us, the communication was awesome and she was available whenever anything arise.  Also, she had plenty of amenities in case you forgot to pack it yours. We would definitely stay again at Anna's place.  Thanks a lot Anna, for your help and sharing your guest house.",clean
"Five stars across the board.  This was one of the best Airbnb experiences weâve had.  Wonderful studio (pseudo one bedroom) with full kitchen, bathroom and separate living area.  The owner clearly takes great care with the unit -  super organized, very clean, well stocked kitchen and bathroom etc.  The unit is on the same property as the owners house but it felt very private for us.  Plenty of street parking also.",clean
We highly recommend Anna and her Zen Studio.  Anna provided everything that we could want or need.  She even provided snacks and wine which was a real treat especially after our flight.

"There's a reason for the high ratings of this property - its just wonderful! You basically have a little house to yourself. Its comfortable, quiet, and has all the little amenities that make it feel like a home away from home. I gave the location 4 stars out of 5,  just because you're not in downtown LA or within walking distance of many places. But the quiet neighborhood feels like a great getaway. And there's some very good restaurants and shopping right in Glendale (check out Sushi Ahn - shockingly good for a mall restaurant. And The Morrison Atwater Village is also amazing, great burger/beer joint). Next time I'm in LA, I'll certainly stay here again!",location
Anna is a wonderful and thoughtful host! She bends over backwards for her guests. The space is wonderful and private and comfortable. Can not recommend the host or space highly enough!,space
"Anna is the consummate host. She's patient, thoughtful and kind! She went above and beyond at every turn to accommodate us even as we used the property. She is easy to communicate with and the accommodations could not be nicer and more comfortable. If you're coming to Southern California you can do better than her place! She's probably the best host I've ever encountered through airbnb",host

"We had a good stay at Anna's homey little place in the Verdugo Hills.  It's just right for 2 people, and stocked with snacks, lotion, coffee, everything you might need and then some. She even had nail polish!   Check in was easy.  The property was great, there were lots of places to just sit and hang out and listen to the wild parrots.  The neighborhood is beautiful and the location is great, easy access to the Montrose district with all its little cafes and restaurant, Brand Ave in Glendale,  Eagle Rock,  and the newly chi chi neighborhoods in Highland Park.  It's also close to  Pasadena, downtown LA, and Burbank, and an easy escape if you are driving in on the 5.  Anna herself is a sweetheart, 100%.  Thanks again for mailing my favorite thermos, that was truly above and beyond!",location
"Such an amazing stay at Annaâs Zen Studio!! The pictures are accurate and her home is a wonderful place to work, relax and unwind. It is hard to leave! The bed is very comfortable and I found having a washer/dryer extremely helpful when staying longer. Regarding location (in Glendale), it is not far from shopping malls (Glendale Galleria, The Americana at Brand, etc.), site-seeing (Los Angeles Zoo, Universal Studios, Griffith Park) or whatever you may want to do. Having street side parking was also a huge plus! And, I found a delicious coffee shop 3 miles away called Ideology Coffee. Had a great time and appreciate Anna & Tony for all the âextraâ touches â snacks, water & wine! Best hosts ever. Many thanks!",location

"Jay's place was in a great location, close to Rodeo Drive and the centre of Beverly Hills. The apartment was simply furnished but I wouldn't have described it as five star. It was quite expensive compared to some of the other places we stayed at during our US trip, which were extremely high quality and good value for money. Jay was very helpful and responsive but parking was a little difficult as we had out-of-state plates. ",location
Cute and dainty apartment which is suitable for twin sharing. Location was fantastic.,location

Great place to sleep and regroup. Nice Beverly Hills location.  I will be back.,location
Fantastic location in the heart of Beverly Hills. Jay was super communicative and the check in/check out process was very smooth. The studio was very cute - perfect for me and my girlfriend. The location is in a plush and safe neighborhood - a 2 minute walk for the famous rodeo drive.,location
"The building itself was super lovely and in an ideal location for my visiting guest â right next to Rodeo Drive. The entryway was really spectacular â vintage villa style â and there was a neat old-school elevator.<br/><br/>The room itself was a bit smaller than I expected, however amenable and clean. No AC but the window was opened and the fan was running before I got in, so it wasn't hot.<br/><br/>Jay was easy to communicate with and getting in was a breeze. No complaints!",clean

Jays place was great. Just as described. The building is nice and very clean. Checking in is super easy. Parking pass is definately a must if you have a car. The place is easily walkable to shops and restaurants in Beverly Hills. Overall great value.,clean
"Unfortunately, a very disappointing experience. Linen and pillows had spots and stains on them and looked as if they were recently used and not laundered and had a used smell to it. The bathroom also looked as if it hadn't been cleaned in a while. Apartment did not smell clean either and in general had a strong odor. Should also note that aside from a small fan, there is no air conditioning in the apartment, and as it's located on the third floor, it was very warm and uncomfortable. It was too disgusting to sleep here for the night and had to find other accommodations. While communication with Jay was good, it does not look there will be any refund.",clean
"Perhaps some rough edges - no hand soap and some dust - but a great location, a comfortable place, and a killer cool older Beverly Hills building close to everything. We would stay here again, and Jay's communication is excellent.",location
Awesome location in Beverly Hills. Just a small uber fee and you can be at Sunset Boulevard and enjoying LAs best rock music.,location
Super cute old Hollywood-style apartment in a perfect location. Highly recommend if you are here to work or visit in Beverly Hills!,location
Great quiet location. Jay answered every questions we had. Would recommend if you have a car to make sure you have Californian licence plates as we had out of state plates and was a bit of a hassle due to Beverly hills restrictions.,location
Great apartment and location!,location

"We had a wedding in Beverly Hills and wanted to be close to the venue. This apartment was perfect for the location and amenities. It had everything we needed for a comfortable (and affordable) weekend! Check in was super easy and Jay was very communicative. One note: there is no AC, which is stated in the listing description. We didnât think it would be an issue but it was randomly 90 degrees in October and it got pretty hot in the room. Just something to keep in mind depending on what season youâre looking to book for!",location

And you can tell they put a lot of time and thought into small touches, like baskets of fluffy towels, hand-painted furniture, and fresh bars of soap. There was also a sunshiny deck that was perfect for breakfast. A refreshingly simple place to stay away from the crowds in Santa Monica or Malibu, but still accessible to both - we had a great time.

Susan and Kenny were there to meet us and make us feel welcome. They gave us there contact and information if we needed anything at all and left us in total privacy.,clean
"My husband and I have been Airbnb users for over 5 years and this was one of our best experiences yet! The cottage is very comfortable, with gorgeous mountain views from its private yard, and yet it's only a short drive to the beach. Kenny & Susan were great hosts (they let us check in really late since our flight arrived late) and such fascinating folks. The only thing I would say about the location is it can be a bit tricky to find the entrance at dark, but after we did it to once, we were just fine.",location
Susan and Kenny were very gracious and friendly hosts! The location really isn't that far from other parts of LA one might want to see and we even got lucky and saw some shooting stars. The cottage is clean and cozy and has everything you need to feel comfortable.,location
"We had a great stay at Susan and Ken's place.<br/><br/>The cottage is a fantastic place for two people and the photos on Air BnB don't do it justice.  The indoor space is relaxing, with a spacious living room and kitchen, and your backyard is Topanga Canyon itself.<br/><br/>We were looking to disconnect and decompress and this spot was the taste of the West Coast that we were looking for.  With easy access to the West Side of LA and the Valley and, even better, the amazing beaches in Malibu, we were sad to leave.<br/><br/>Ken and Susan made wonderful hosts.  The place was spotless when we arrived, they gave us plenty of space and privacy to unwind in the canyon on our own, but we also feel like we've met friends we hope to visit again.<br/><br/>Our one regret is that we only booked for three days!<br/><br/><br/>",location
"Jay's place was brilliant.<br/>It is situated in a very nice area a stones throw away from the famous Rodeo Dr and other local amenities.<br/>The property was clean, tidy and spacious for a studio.<br/>The Check in process was hassle free and Jay's communication was top notch.<br/>I would recommend staying here and was sad to leave.<br/>It felt like a home away from home.",location
A conveniently located studio space that was a perfect home base for my work trip.  Thanks for everything!,location
"This was the worst Airbnb Iâve ever been in, through and through. I feel duped by the lack of photos; and the claim that itâs a âprivate unitâ in the back is a complete misrepresentation. Walking in through the yard to a smell of trash from full trash bins, through smell of urine to a really worn down apartment with windows that donât lock, windows looking out to a yard that is a complete mess and an eyes sore. No soap or hand towels, dirty pots and pans... Beware of the lack of photos. One ok thing was a comfortable mattress.",clean
Awesome place! Nice surrounding area as well.,location

We went up for pride weekend and our Airbnb that was booked cancelled on us the day we arrived. We frantically looked for a new place to stay and happened upon Joshs listing. He was quick to get us in and the house was amazing. Thank you josh for saving the day! Would definitely stay again :),location
"Josh is an amazing host, we came in late and he was there anytime. Will be back",host
"This was my first Airbnb experience, and it will not be my last.  Susan and Ken were great hosts.  They responded to my initial inquiries very quickly and were very helpful through the whole process.  I found the messaging in the Airbnb application to be a very convenient way to communicate.  I was able to coordinate my arrival time, and Ken met me when I arrived to show me where to park and give me a tour of the cottage and grounds. I was provided with cell phone numbers for both Ken and Susan in case there was anything I needed. Ken provided several recommendations for hiking and other activities in the area.  The cottage is clean, private, very comfortable and has a great view of the canyon.  I felt like I was coming home at the end of the day; so much nicer than being at a hotel!  The location was perfect.  I was able to take advantage of hiking at Red Rock Canyon Park, a recommendation by Ken, in the morning and then headed to Malibu to spend the afternoon.  I also saw a very entertaining show at an outdoor theater called the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum, which is just a few minutes away.  I had a fantastic stay, and I would recommend this cottage to anyone who plans to visit the area.  ",host
"Josh is a kind and friendly host and a prompt communicator. The unit is in the back of a large house, along with two other units, and a shaded little courtyard with a table and chairs for outdoor relaxing. It feels like a mini-motel with lots of friendly guests (often with pets) coming and going. We were there for 20 days, and got the opportunity to really know the place. The location of the house is fantastic--close to bars, restaurants, cafes, etc. You can walk, scooter, bike, bus, and very easily drive all over LA from this central location. <br/>A few things to note--if you have a car, you will be asked to give your keys to the host so that he can manage the line of cars in the driveway. Very kind of him to manage this for the guests, but this was a surprise when we arrived. Otherwise, you can do your best to find street parking (but there is street cleaning twice a week, so street-park at your own risk). The unit itself is very dark and does not have good air circulation, despite having AC in the living room. The unit overall is very rundown, but does have most things you would need, albeit not in very good shape. I'm sure with a deep-clean, fresh coats of paint, more lights, and a fan in the bedroom, it could be quite nice; but in the meantime, you get what you pay for.",location
Thank you so much for letting us stay! We enjoyed the place and definitely recommend to anyone looking for somewhere to stay. Thanks for being such a good host as well.,host
The great parking service helped a lot.,clean
My wife and I stayed at Susan's and Kenny's cottage for six days. They were very welcoming and were prompt in addressing our questions during the stay. Susan even went out of her way to show us the town and hiking trails. The Cottage was very beautiful with great views. The kitchen was fully equipped with quality utensils and appliances. The whole place was airy and had plenty of morning sun. It was a great experience and we already miss being there.,location
"PARADISE! My husband and I were in town for a wedding in the canyon and happened upon this listing literally around the corner. After arriving early from Chicago, Susan and Kenny were the perfect hosts. Beyond welcoming, helpful and full of recommendations and ""insider"" tips for the area. Truly, I cannot say enough about our magical experience here. The property itself was exactly as described. Perfect for a couple, private and fully-equipped kitchen. Honestly, however, the real perks of this place are Susan and Kenny themselves. Between Kenny giving my musician husband a personal tour of his studio, Susan taking the time to lead us out to the very secluded but well-worth it Red Rock Canyon and even offering to drive us to our friend's wedding Saturday night - we immediately felt at ease and, as someone already mentioned, as if we were simply visiting old friends. The Topanga canyon is a magical place and we fully intend on returning to this property one day with our little girl. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! ",location
Kenny and Susan are great hosts.  Whenever we needed something they were available right away and friendly.  The cottage is comfy and country which is a nice change from our city life in New York! ,location
"Had a great stay in Ken and Susan's cottage. It's very well equipped, in a lovely part of Topanga with a really pretty garden to relax in while admiring the views over the canyon. Ken and Susan were most helpful and even left some Irish breakfast tea for us on arrival. The location is great too   - minutes to Malibu and Calabasas, and the 101, and about 25 mins from downtown Santa Monica. Would definitely stay here again.",location
"Ken & Susan were such a delight. Their Topanga cottage was so cute and cozy and very convenient to the wedding we were attending at 1909 (1 minute drive.) I wish we had more time to hike and explore the canyon, as you really feel transported to a serene place when there, and Ken is full of tips and tidbits on exploring the nature of the area.<br/><br/>We'll definitely look forward to a return and will refer your cozy cottage to our friends visiting the area.<br/><br/>Cheers!",location
The cottage was very nice and clean. We loved sitting <br/>on the deck or in the yard in the mornings before we headed out for the day. My son who lives in Los Angeles knew the area so we didn't need much help in that direction from our hosts and they respected that but they responded very quickly when we did have a few questions. Very pleasant place to stay!,clean
"Loved my little weekend here. The canyon is beautiful and the Mazurs were exceedingly accommodating and hospitable. If you're looking to get away, this is a great little spot.",location
"A truly great experience. Alice and Ken are wonderful hosts and the cottage is quite the cozy, magical place. Everything was just as described and upon the moment we arrived, Alice and Ken really made us feel welcome. Warm and friendly and very much the epitome of the Topanga vibe and energy. The views were beautiful and it was such a little slice of heaven to sit and have coffee on the deck/porch in the morning. Exactly what was needed for our getaway.",location
Ken & Alice are lovely people. We really enjoyed the sunny yard and outdoor sitting area -- great views of the mountains. ,location
Ken and Alice are nearly family now! :)<br/><br/>We have stayed there twice now we love it so much. ,location
Alice and Ken made my boyfriend and I feel extremely welcome.  The listing is exactly as described.  Topanga Canyon is a beautiful place to visit.  Overall I had a fantastic experience.  I couldn't recommend this cottage enough. ,location
"From house to outdoor inside each place, you can feel they love here, with the heart of the very create a beautiful environment.",location
"We had a lovely time in this beautiful cottage. Ken and Susan were there to greet us and responsive to our every inquiry. We were at a conference less than a mile away and so the location was perfect. Very restful sleep. Highly recommended for anyone visiting not only Topanga, but LA or the valley in general. An easy ride from pristine wilderness to urban life.",location
"I had a very nice stay in this charming and very clean Cottage. The place is very private inside and outside, you can go and hike directly from the place in the beautiful nature of Topanga. <br/>Ken and Alice are super nice, very helpful and answering your questions or needs very quickly. I had Great talks about music and films with Ken!!! <br/>",clean
"I had a wonderful stay in Alice and Tim's guesthouse.  The unit is cozy and comfortable, and quiet, and has a great vibe.  It is located toward the Valley side, which worked out well for me because my daughter and friends are there and it is fast and easy to get down the hill.   The place has everything you need for a short or long stay.  I was just very comfortable there.<br/><br/>Tim met me and, like the house, he is a good vibe guy.  He made sure I was settled in and had everything I needed.  I will definitely be back.<br/>",location
"Alice and Ken welcomed us to a homey, comfortable cottage in a beautiful location with two outdoor dining tables - sun and shade -, a wonderful garden of many flowers and plants and garden chairs for a restful siesta in the California sunshine. Inside there is all  you need and our hosts encouraged us to ask at any time for anything more. It is a bonus that Alice and Ken are warm, friendly, thoughtful people living interesting lives. We've already booked our next stay. Need we say more?",location
"Gold stars don't convey Ken and Susan's easygoing warmth, friendliness and flexibility. They seem to have a sixth sense about when a bit of help would be welcome yet are respectful of privacy always.  And just hint at something you might like in the kitchen and it appears in the blink of an eye. The cottage is a lovely place to be.  In late summer we'll be back for our third stay. ",location
Wonderful cottage in Topanga that was exactly as pictured. It was very clean and well appointed including a (Hidden by Airbnb) chromecast to use the TV. The house is right on Topanga Canyon so use your GPS to know when to turn off the road into the drive way. It is closer to the Valley side which was very convenient for our trip. We really enjoyed watching the bunnies play in the garden most mornings early and the wifi made it very easy to work remotely from within the cottage.,clean
"The cottage was a great place to come home to each afternoon and evening after a long day at a training!  It was so peaceful and relaxing, my friend and I slept soundly!  It's is accessible to all areas and the views were outstanding!",location
Kenny and Alice were absolutely amazing! Made us feel so welcome. The house was better than expected! Topanga is the coolest place in L.A. This is located on the top of the mountain separating the Valley and the Canyon. Gets hot up there but go down to the beach for a cool breeze and the Malibu beaches!,location
"Alice and Ken made me feel welcome by warmly greeting me, assisting me with my luggage,<br/>And taking me on a tour of the cottage.  My breath was taken away by the stunning 180 degree views of the Santa Monica Mountains from the backyard.  Alice and Ken are extremely responsive and always available and willing to grant requests.  They were respectful of my privacy and proactively gave helpful tips on hiking trails and recommended local restaurants.  They even gave me recommendations on other areas of California that I should visit.  For a luxury cabin feel in the mountains,   I would highly recommend staying in their cottage.  The cottage is spacious, clean, comfortable, and completely private and separate from the main house.  Enjoy the solitude of the cottage by sleeping with the patio door open and experience the clear view of the stars at night.  ",location
"A great spot!  Up on a hill directly off of Topanga Blvd.   You can hear the traffic from the road, but also the wonderful crickets at night and birds in the morning! Very spacious downstairs and cumfy couches.  Fully equipped kitchen but bring all your ingredients. We were very comfortable with 2 people for a week of working, exploring, and relaxing.  Simple and fabulous Topanga!",location
"Alice and Ken made us feel super welcome. They even gave us a ride at 7am to a hidden hiking spot in the area. It was very beautiful. The cottage was very nice. There was lots of vegetation, great views and very clean. I miss it already!",location
"It was very easy to communicate with Ken and their cottage was clean. There are quite a few steps to get up to the cottage from the car, so I'm glad I packed light! It's quiet and you're surrounded by nature. There were two rabbits that visited a couple of times as well.",location
Great Studio. Even better location. Thank You!,location
"The location is superb, close to the famed Rodeo Drive area and, more importantly, So. Beverly Dr. with several cafÃ©s (including Peetâs, always an advantage!), takeaway venues, restaurants, etc.  The apartment is about the size of a hotel room, fine for a single but a bit tight for a couple or larger group.  There is no microwave.  There is also not proper table for eating or working on a laptop either and I missed that (there is a coffee table by the couch but itâs uncomfortable for working).  The bed is very comfortable. The bathroom is not as clean as I would have liked (the sill in the shower was grimy).  The check in times are a bit rigid.  I was worried about the street parking because the permit boundaries are narrow but it turned out, happily, to not be a problem whatsoever.",clean
"Everythingis goodï¼ especially the transportation , it will be nice if the sound insolution is better",clean
"This is a five-star stay with two of the kindest most generous people you're likely to meet. The cottage is complete for a short or long stay and Ken and Alice are always available for a chat, a laugh, or to attend to the smallest request. This is our third stay and we're already looking forward to the next one.",location
"Nice hosts and a lovely little cottage. We were attending a wedding in Topanga Canyon and it was nice to stay just 5 minutes away. <br/>Pros: adorable atmosphere, right in Topanga Canyon, very private<br/>Cons: it's quite a hike up a steep hill to get to the cottage, there's no microwave, some yard work and construction were taking place around our parking at the bottom of the hill, which it made it tricky to load our cars.<br/>Overall, it met our needs well and we enjoyed our stay greatly.<br/>",location
Ken was very accommodating.  My meeting ended early and he met me at the property with minimal notice.  On one occasion there was a problem with hot water.  Ken did the repair within the hour and sent me a text with an update on the status.,clean

Its entire of house but it's like a little house in the back of another house ð<br/>But it great fit for 4 person to stay,location
"Amazing place, amazing hosts! Would recommend!",location
This place is really awesome specially for the price and location. The house is really big and spacious. The host are super nice and accommodating.,location
"This place is pretty great for the most part. The host is responsive, the space is sort of private and the location is great. The only thing that makes me stop from giving it a perfect score would be how everything around the place is also an Airbnb. This led to a lot of people entering and exiting at odd hours and creating a lot of noise. If you donât mind the noise itâs a really nice place and the hosts are super nice.",location
Jason was a great host. Nice and very informative. He was accommodating with our late check in. We really appreciated that. The place is just right. Itâs all you really need if you are going to be exploring the Los Angeles area. They do provide parking on their long driveway so be aware space is limited and you will have to move your car around or they can do it for you. Overall awesome experience and stay at Joshuaâs place.,location
Hosts were super helpful and accommodating with check in times and making sure we had a parking spot.,clean
Wasnât there long to actual give you a 100 percent feedback. But overall it was an ok stay. Nothing special at all.,location
My month long stay at Ken and Alice's cottage was fabulous. The cottage is in a great location in the canyon making it an easy drive to shopping in Woodland Hills and an equally easy drive to the beaches. It is also very close to hiking in Topanga state park. The cottage is very large with plenty of room to roam. A bonus is the beautiful back yard and porch. I had everything that I needed. Ken and Alice are great people that I can now call friends and I highly recommend their beautiful slice of paradise!<br/>,location

Great location!,location
The location of the studio is perfect. Few minutes walk to rodeo drive and Beverly dr. The building is antic and has a very pretty lobby. The stay was comfortable with the exception of the days it was 94 in LA in November. The place has no AC which is clear in the listing but keep that in mind. The apartment gets hot since itâs on the top floor. A fan is provided however.,location
I loved how easy it was to get in and out. Perfect location for anyone doing business on the west side of town. Very quiet at night. I would definitely stay here again!,location
"Cleanliness: when I stepped into the room it looked quite clean overall. However, the fitted and flat sheets looked wrinkled as if someone had slept in it already and upon closer inspection, I found a number of hairs left behind from the previous guest on the bottom sheet. I ended up sleeping on top of the flat sheet because I didnât want to touch the sheets underneath. Even with that I felt the top comforter probably hadnât been washed either and it was just an uncomfortable experience sleeping. I brought my own pillow thank goodness. <br/><br/>Communication: donât expect Jay to get back to any of your messages before the day of checkin. Her policy seems to be to let you know instructions a couple of hours before checkin time. Iâm just used to hosts who responds when I message so after a couple days of no responses I had to follow up and ask if Iâm going to get instructions since it was the day before my checkin day. I had a car and was worried about the permit but apparently itâs information that Jay needs to know only an hour or so before your checkin. <br/><br/>Amenities: there is a tv but I didnât use it because nothing worked. I thought there would be at least local channels to provide some background noise before bed but there wasnât any. I ended up using my laptop to watch Netflix. There was hand soap and fresh towels. I didnât use the kitchen nor the shower. It was a cold night so I turned on the little heater fan available in the corner. It helped. <br/><br/>Noise: the walls are thin so you can definitely hear all the noises especially when others go in and out in the hallway. Iâm very sensitive to sound so I always bring earplugs so I canât say how much noise there was while asleep. <br/><br/>Building: it is old and charming. Location canât be beat if you want to stay close to central Beverly Hills.",clean
"Delightful building, classic styling and easy walk to great restaurants!",location
"Jay's apartment is very well located next to the most famous streets in Beverly Hills. It is also very close to the friends I came to visit, so the apartment was perfect for me: it's big, has good light from the window, and the area is very quiet. Everything is well take care off.",location
"Itâs a perfect spot if youâre looking for the Beverly Hills scene. Walking distance from Rodeo Dr. and other shops and restaurants! Itâs a small space, so if thatâs what youâre looking for, then itâs perfect! Jay is very quick to respond and accommodating.",location
Best location at Beverly Hills. Highly recommended :),location
Jays place was very nice. I loved the vintage look of the lobby area. Kinda old Hollywood type style. Location was right around the corner from Rodeo. I would recommend.,location
"The location is excellent. Just a couple blocks from Rodeo Dr., and tucked away enough that it is quiet at night. This studio is a nice place to crash after a day of shopping, and a night on the town. When in Beverly Hills again, we will likely stay here. Jay was great with communication, and fast with response.",location
The location is amazing! 5 min from rodeo dr but the room is kind of small! If you are not looking for staying in and you want it just for to sleep is perfect!,location
"This place is great, I wish I could Give 10 stars!",location
"Perfect location if you have an event in Beverly Hills. Great neighborhood, parking not too hard to find. Adorable (old) building and quant apartment; quiet. The cleanliness of room needs improvement. Jay was helpful and answered all our questions in a timely manor. Responsive host.",location

"The room was in a cool old building very close to the main drag in Beverly Hills.  I was taking a course at the Beverly Wilshire that was only a few minutes walk away.  The building was quiet, which I appreciate.  My only issue was that the room wasn't super clean (some hair in the tub for example) and there was also an open bottle of wine in the fridge.  Just not at a level of tidiness that I expect.  Other than that, it worked well for me and was a great value considering the neighborhood.",location
Jay is incredibly responsive. The place does not have AC. Though it wasnât uncomfortable it should be noted. Overall though a good value for money.,location
"We had a lot of traveling to do around LA and this location worked perfectly. Easy driving from Airport, to downtown and up north. Itâs a charming vintage building in a quiet upscale neighborhood with restaurants within walking distance from five star to coffee shops not to mention lots of shopping just a couple blocks away. Great communication with host.  Will definitely stay again.",location
"This home is a slice of country near the ""big city"".  Driving distance to the beach, cities, state parks and attractions.  It is difficult to walk to any sites from this home, but driving is not too difficult.  There are quite a number of steps to the home, so be prepared to haul your belongings to the home.  We dearly loved being at the home in Topanga Canyon.  It met all of our needs and expectations.   ",location
"Ken and Alice are awesome people and wonderful hosts. My husband got to chat with Ken for a while and hear about his interesting life as a musician, which was fascinating. They have huge hearts, as seen by their animal rescue work. There was a miniature pony when we were there! Their cottage is lovely and a great option if you want to be near the hustle and bustle of LA but not in it. My biggest helpful hint is to pack as light as you can, and that this place isn't for you if you have knee problems. (Also avoid in late pregnancy!) There are many stairs to get up to the cottage from the parking area, and a set of the steepest stairs I've ever seen to get up to the bedroom. Luckily there's a gate at the top that we put something heavy in front of to keep our toddler inside. The shower has a lot of pressure, the kitchen is stocked with gear but bring all the condiments you'll need (spices, honey, shoyu, etc.) There's an electric hot water kettle, which is great if you drink tea like I do. The space heaters kept the place cozy warm during the crazy storms while we were there. The washer and dryer out back were really appreciated since we use cloth diapers! Ken and Alice were great at communicating and really easy to get a hold of when we needed to. We definitely recommend staying here, and we'll be back next time we're headed to LA. Thank you Alice and Ken for a lovely stay!",location
Lots of wonderful places open late and within walking distance to eat. A few minute walk to The Wiltern and Ralph's.,location

Definitely worth the money and a fantastic stay!,price
"We were so excited to find a dog-friendly stay in LA, but Joshuaâs place is wonderful even for those without dogs! <br/><br/>The guesthouse is fully stocked with towels, extra blankets and dishes/utensils, and Joshua was super accommodating to us arriving earlier than the check-in time! <br/><br/>Joshua also has an adorable pup named Mickey who is the perfect playmate for your dogs! Sheâs well-behaved and gentle, but full of energy or tag or tug of war!<br/><br/>This place is also in a great location- quiet, but close to so many great restaurants and bars, and Joshua is happy to provide the best recommendations!",location
"It was a great location. They have a long driveway so they are able to accommodate parking, which is very helpful since finding parking on the streets in LA is very difficult.<br/><br/>The place had everything we needed. Would definitely recommend staying here.",location
"Joshua and Jason took good care of my family traveling from Seoul Korea and myself with 4 year old daughter. Very quick response, easy check in/ check out, free private drive way parking, full kitchen and lowest price in town. Thank you again for accommodating us with early check in!",clean
"Ken and Alice are great hosts and very sweet and friendly people. Communication was always swift. The location is very secluded and peaceful with free rabbits and gophers to commune with. The Valley is surprisingly quick to get to, which is useful for shopping, and the west side/beach is close as well. A nice place to get away from it all.",location
"Another great stay in Alice & Ken's cottage. Enjoyed it so much we cancelled plans to travel further up the coast in favour of adding more days to our stay at the cottage in Topanga. <br/>Alice and Ken are warm, friendly and accommodating hosts and the cottage and garden are great. Looking forward to the next trip back.",location
Great location... stayed here for 4 nights. The neighborhood was a little loud at times but was able to tune it out. WiFi was great and the tv had Netflix and Hulu.,location
"Place is just as pictured. Located in a beautiful building and even more beautiful neighbourhood. Perfect room for 2 people. Couldn't have asked for anything better for my girls trip! Thanks for your room Jay, and for being so quick to respond to our questions.",location
"Provisions and lack of communication by host was anything but Luxury 5 Star.<br/>Worst travel experience ""ever"".",location
"The general state of the apartment was very dirty and dusty. There were bugs in the bathroom (silverfish?), and hair in the shower. There were stains on the comforter, and we weren't able to find any clean hand towels or bath towels anywhere in the apartment (we did find an old, dirty, crumpled up bath towel in the utility closet). The bed was slanted and uncomfortable. The walls were incredibly thin, and we were woken up by loud neighbors several times during the night.<br/><br/>That said, the location is great and Jay was very cooperative in letting us self check in late at night.",clean
I would prefer to not write a public review. I have already communicated directly with Jay what my concerns were.,location
"Jay is great - this is a great value and location. Yes, it was dusty and a little shabby but for those who poo poo it, 500 wonât get you near as much at Beverly Hilton.",clean
"Honestly.. I had a bad to decent experience at best. Few issues with the place with the main issue being the toilet not properly working. I had mentioned it not working the first night and received no reply. We had to figure it out ourselves by taking off the top lid of and adjusting the lever for the water to flow through. Aside from the toilet situation, we had little interaction with the host aside from the first night texts. We actually walked by the host numerous times outside during our stay and they never acknowledged us aside from saying nice shoes. Lol thanks bro. We thought they were just some random people staying at the other Airbnb's- there are 2 other rooms at this location. It wasn't until the last day I learned who they were when they came to the door to check when we were leaving. Introductions/acknowledgements aren't always necessary but we just found it a little odd especially after walking by them a few times. *shrugs*. Last thing, was getting woken up early in the morning by noise and yard work right outside our window by the hosts. I'm all about getting up and getting work done but felt it was a little inconsiderate- considering you have people staying there that are on vacation. No one want's to get woken up like that on vacay. Some good things though.. good location a little outside K-Town. good neighborhood. Place itself was decent, clean for the most part but could use a real deep cleaning. Heater worked when it wanted to but mostly not. Ehhhh i'ma wrap this up, if you're looking for a cheap place where you're in and out for most of the day and just need a bed to sleep then cool this may work for you. Other than that I would not recommend. Too many issues for me in my personal experience for my needs. But hey, I hope works out better for you. Seems like the host has a better handle on it now, plumbing was supposedly coming later that day as well. Wish y'all the best regardless.",clean
"This is the first time I was truly disappointed with an Airbnb.  Let me start off by stating that I was not expecting a five star hotel but a reasonable place where I can stay three nights without any major issues.  <br/><br/>After the stay, I must say that Iâm still very confused about the ratings that the others gave this place. <br/><br/>Let me explain. <br/><br/>First, the place is just old and not really well kept.  The place smelled old, the bathroom was old, the floors were old, the couch was old...you get the idea.  It could have used a little help from a decent cleaning company before I checked in.  <br/><br/>Second, the walls are so thin that you can hear EVERYTHING from the adjacent units.  The house must have at least 4-5 separate units.  I heard a couple of ladies talking their ears off at 2-3 am the first night.  I was awaken at 8 am from some house construction that the owner was performing right outside of my bedroom window. <br/><br/>The 2nd night was just as eventful as I heard the ladies again along with my wonderful neighbors above me walking around at 2 in the morning.  The other neighbor (not the ladies) also chimed in with the occasional âhey Iâm your neighborâ sounds.  The last night was the best as I heard one of the neighbors blasting their music with awesome bass until 4-5 am.  This made me forget about the first two nights.  <br/><br/>Look.  This place is in a great location.  That is it.  If you donât care about the other stuff and you will be in town just to sleep and shower then I guess this is the place for you.   Please bring some ear plugs though.  <br/><br/>For the price, I hope you can find another place to spend your money. <br/><br/>I picked this place due to the location (very close to my friendâs place) and the reviews that I must say am still not sure of. <br/><br/>I will be staying at a major hotel chain next time I visit Los Angeles.",clean
"Great location, right next to Rodeo Drive.  Make sure you get a car with CA plates if youâre renting!",location
"The place was in a great and convenient location. Jay was always very quick to respond and answered all my questions, communication was easy and fast. Check in and check out were smooth, instructions were provided day-of which was fine. Would definitely stay here again next time I visit LA. Thanks!",clean
"Cute apartment, close to everything, a reasonable price and Jay was super responsive and helpful for anything I needed!  I'd definitely recommend staying here.",location
Incredible location in a classic apartment block. Frustrating parking restrictions and lack of air con meant we felt the heat.,location
We found it quite dirty.  Floors were dirty and gritty so we either feet or socks had to be brushed off continually. Huge dust bunnies under sofa bed (i took photos ).  Coffee maker was covered in dust. Stove exhaust was caked in old grease.  Coffee maker had old coffee left inside.  The window blinds didn't work so morning sunlight woke us. Blind not close-able meant no privacy at night from neighbors. Also two towels for two people for six days seems very inadequate.   This is a lovely old world apartment building which is elegant and in terrific location.  Pretty quiet building with other residents being friendly and respectful of each other.,clean
"Do not expect a ""5-star Luxe"" experience! That being said, it's hard to beat the price and location of this place. It is within walking distance of Rodeo Drive and has all the amenities needed. It is a quiet place and away from all the other tourists which is a plus in my book! The building is also a bit of a historic landmark down to the ancient elevator and paper thin windows. This apartment however has had some modern updates which make it a very pleasant stay in my opinion.",location
"The sheets were unwashed, as my husband and I realized around midnight of our first of our reserved 2-night stay. We left in the middle of the night for a hotel (which was an unplanned expense) for the remainder of our stay. The left-window blind was broken so it didn't come down all the way. Also, there were only 2 body towels provided (which isn't necessarily a BAD thing,) but instead of any hand towels, there was only a face cloth provided. Location is great - walkable to downtown Beverly Hills. No cable, but Hulu and Netflix worked fine and dandy. We communicated our disappointment with Jay but have yet to hear back.",clean
"Ken and Alice were wonderful hosts, they were extremely helpful and kind. The house really had everything, before going we were questioning if the place had a stove and oven because you can't see one in the pictures, but of course they had it, as well as everything else we needed. ",clean
Susan-Alice and Ken were wonderful during our stay! They made our first time experience using Airbnb and vacation rental memorable with their hospitality and always being a phone call away! We appreciate the personal care and guidance from Susan in suggesting the family friendly Topanga state park trails.<br/><br/>Thanks again to Susan and Ken for the great experience!,location
"Alice and Ken are very welcoming hosts and the place is just as described, very comfortable. We had dinner out in the yard one evening and enjoyed the cool evening, sunset, and canyon views. Very nice!",location
"This little a-frame is perched up in the hills, with stunning views and a sense of being so close and yet so far from the city. However, don't expect silence - traffic noise bounces up the canyons and reminds you that you're not as much out bush as the scenery lets you imagine. This didn't get in the way of our sleep or comfort, though. It's just an interesting juxtaposition. <br/><br/>Accommodation was comfortable, but not private for a foursome. A flight of very steep stairs leads to the attic bedroom but as there is no door separating the spaces, any noise travels down. There is a single and double pull out sofas in the lounge room downstairs,  which our 2 teenagers used, and that essentially took up any indoor living space available. But the outdoor space is beautiful, ample, and easy to be in so it didn't really matter to us at all. <br/><br/>One major thing to be aware of is that access to the a-frame is very long and steep. We are all able-bodied so it was not a problem (we did break a sweat!), but anyone with limited mobility would struggle. <br/><br/>Communication was fine, and Ken, our host, was incredibly generous with our guitarist son, loaning him a guitar to play and even showing him his studio and giving him a few master-class pointers. This meant the world to all of us.",location
"Alice and Ken are lovely hosts - very warm, kind and generous people who are happy to help you with anything you may need or want! The cottage is beautifully located with the added bonus of little rabbits and squirrels running around and other animals you can visit by their house which creates such a natural and relaxing atmosphere. Overall, we had a great time and would love to visit again one day :) Thank you!",location
"It's unique and spacious, perfectly appointed, charming and peaceful. Alice welcomed us in such warm and attentive way. The place is a most adorable nest with canyon views from a comfortable patio. All near a great local cafe. The A Frame/Attic bedroom is fun and whimsical. Then Ken shared with us their animal rescue missions by introducing us to some of their ""recovering friends"". Wonderful people. Wonderful experience.",location
"I stayed at Alice and Kens place for a month. They are both warm and wonderful human beings with a genuine care and interest in your well being.  The space was comfortable, well equipped and welcoming.   My time at the cottage was peaceful and relaxing.   Thank you guys !!",location
"I enjoyed talking with Ken about his experiences in the music business, Whole foods and Trader Joes are close and the internet is great, but otherwise I didnât like it here. Itâs hard to park a car because of the hill going up the driveway and then turning off into the parking space. Itâs a long walk up a dusty dirt path. Itâs right on the highway between Malibu and Woodland Hills, its so noisy I couldnât stand outside and talk on the phone. I had problems sleeping. I started looking at other Airbnbâs in the area a couple days after I got here because I was expecting it to be quiet based on the pictures, but its hard when you drive 1200 miles and thereâs a lack of places in LA last minute in December so I decided to stay. But I wished I had canceled my reservation the day I got there as I originally booked the place for 3 months but only stayed for one month. The washer and dryer are outside, it was really windy most of the time I was there, so it was always blowing dirt in the washer. A couple times I washed my clothes and opened up the washer and there was a layer of dirt on them, I had to wash them 5 times before they were cleaner than they were before putting them in the washer. There was no closet or any place to hang clothes. The stove and water heater run out of propane every 7-10 days, so I would turn on the stove and it wouldnât light, so had to ask for more propane. Ken always got it right away, but itâs annoying to wonder when itâs going to run out. The toilet didnât seem to be bolted to the floor. Thereâs no heat, just a space heater, if I turned it on low at night it would get so hot I would wake up and if I left it off I would wake up because it was so cold. If that didnât wake me up the traffic would. They told me I couldnât ship anything to their address, so I used their PO Box for one package that got there 10 days before I left, I asked them for it, and they never gave it to me. I tried to talk to Ken about some of these issues, my dad was in the hospital and I had some business problems so I had to leave early, I talked to his wife briefly and she told me Ken would call me at 4pm that day, he never called or contacted me again. I sent a message through Airbnb and they never responded. I left a day earlier than I said when changing the reservation, I left them a message on Airbnb that I left, and they contacted Airbnb the day after I left and stated I hadnât left even though I was already in Oregon by that time....",location
"House is sweet and warm.<br/>View is breathtaking, colorful sunrise from the mountain view make every morning special.<br/>Ken and Alice are amazing people, I spent hours with Ken and enjoyed so much.<br/>Location is close to the beach.<br/>Have to say that it was more then I expected and I will prefer this place on any other any time I'll go to LA",location
"If you want beautiful views, a sunny, private and spacious yard and porch, and kind, attentive hosts you will enjoy this cottage in the mountains!",location
Fun comfortable stay for the three of us!,clean
Definetly will be right back!,clean
"Jay was a wonderful host! Everything I needed to know was provided to me beforehand and very clearly/thoroughly. Always quick to respond too! The apartment was very clean and the location is unbeatable, highly recommend!",clean
"Jay was very prompt in replying to messages and the location couldnât be better for tourists, the heart of the city. But the room could be better in terms of cleanliness and amenities.",location
Jay's place is an unbeatable location in Beverly Hills. A great deal considering other hotels in the area are all $350+. Jay is very responsible and accommodating. Would stay again!,location
"Great location walking distance to the delights of Beverly Hills, easy parking available too. Bathroom and towels a little dated but fine. Good wifi, small issue with blind partially broken and half drunk Pepsi left in the fridge. Would recommend as an affordable place to stay in LA.",location
The space was incredible. The building had its own retro- Beverly Hills vibe that made living at the property feel authentic. <br/>Jay was an amazing host.  Communication was effective and always timely. Highly recommend!,location
Great location and very quick responses. If you're getting a rental car just make sure you get one with Californian plates,location
Quick response from the host except when I mentioned that cleanliness needs to address to the cleaning person.<br/><br/>The place was visible dusty everywhere. It seemed like it havenât been dusty in a week or so.  Under the bed was super dusty - probably havenât been dust in a couple years? Its a shame because the location was great.,clean
Great location.<br/>Easy communication and check in. <br/>Perfect area - very close to all everything you want to see and need,location
Fantastic place. The location is very closed to the metro. they have parking available. The communication was great and prompt. The room was clean. A fantastic stay I strongly recommend it,clean
Great place to stay. Good location. Comfortable beds and couches. Make sure you stay in contact with them to ensure you get a parking spot.,location
Joshuaâs place was terrific and parking was a PLUS!,location
"I was visiting LA with my family, primarily to enjoy places like Griffith, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, etc. For that, the location of this place was so perfect for me. It was also pretty close to the LAX airport. The neighborhood was nice and cute, a little away from city hustle.<br/> <br/>Joshua was very quick in responding back. Though we reached late in the evening, he gave us the precise location and check-in instructions, so we had no trouble finding the house and getting in. Parking spaces were also available, but you might have to stack your car up in the driveway. That was not big of a deal since they take care of it in the morning, you just have to put your keys in the main house. <br/><br/>My room was big enough to accommodate 4-5 people. I just stayed for one night. But I would definitely recommend this spot for a budget stay in the city with a big group. Would love to come back again.<br/>Thank you Joshua and Tricia.",location
"Guest house was just as expected, small but spacious. Great location, a quick Uber ride away to any destination.",location
"Great place to stay at, great location, right in the middle of everything pretty much,  very clean as described.",clean
Staying at Joshua's place was pleasant. I felt that my car was secure as the driveway is long and gated. The place was clean and comfortable. The host was quick to respond to messages and helpful when a concern arose. Would stay at his place again.,clean
"great place, right in the heart of k town. lots of things to do around the airbnb & a quick drive to anywhere we wanted to go. i loved how we were able to park in the driveway to avoid the struggle of having to find street parking",location
Great hosts that were very helpful and quick to respond. Great location and very clean during this virus scare.,clean
In need of cleaning and a new toilet seat and it wouldâve been perfect,clean
Really adorable The kitchen it separate and a nice big gas stove is awesome I wish I could have used it LOL,space
Alice and Ken's place is great. Nice getaway from the city for us. We have a relaxing time and enjoyed the views and solitude. As hosts they were perfectly accommodating to my hectic/ever changing schedule that was affecting our check-in time.,location
We loved everything about them! They were so friendly and hospitable and communicated efficiently. Couldnât be happier!,clean
"He is super nice host I ever got. House was so comfortable, clean and convenient. Highly recommended for everyone. Thank you Joshua",clean
This is our second time booking with Joshua. We booked last minute and he accommodated us right away!,clean
Great price for the area and good value for what you pay for. Basic essentials are provided but some updating of the âamenitiesâ would go along way.,price
"The experience was absolutely five stars! It was gorgeous, comfortable and sparkling clean. It was a perfect location as well! Thank you to the fantastic hosts.",clean
This place was AMAZING!!! great host! Very clean and very attentive. Would gladly stay here again,clean

Great place in the district center<br/>Subway is just couple blocks away,location
I love the private parkingit was very useful the place was very clean and nice I would stay again and itâs close to everything about a 20<br/>Min drive,clean
Wonderful and comfortable stay! Great location!,location
The place was very clean and the host responds very quickly. It was a pleasant stay.,clean
"The host was sweet to let me check in early, which I appreciated. However, if you are a single female traveler, I would recommend staying here, as two of the windows did not have locks on them (nor screens) on this first-floor home.  If you're looking for a place to crash that's relatively clean & walkable to restaurants on a tight budget, this would suffice...but it needs many repairs/touch-ups/upgrades & isn't somewhere I would recommend relaxing.",location
Nice enough people. Space was a bit oversold compared to what we actually got. More thorough cleaning and some updated amenities would be a big improvement.,price
"They are super nice people ! They are understanding and show you everything and where everything is. They are super nice and the only issue was parking, other than that 10/10",clean
This is my second time staying with Josh and it was amazing! This is my go-to place because he is so friendly and accommodating. Definitely stay here if youâre visiting!,location
House is very clean and tidy. Better than pics! Hosts are very nice and accompany. Nice view. ,clean
"we LOVED staying at alice and ken's sweet cabin.  we live in the canyon and had to move out of our house so we stayed her for a short term temp stay of about 2 months.  the place is cozy, light, comfy and cute.  we loved the outdoor patio area where we spent a lot of time and some of the best hiking spots in all of topanga are walking distance away.  i have never lived in this part of the canyon before and it's honestly now my favorite part of topanga.  <br/><br/>alice does animal rescue and is such a kind animal-loving person and ken is really personable and friendly too.  any time we needed something or if something needed to be fixed they were on it.  <br/><br/>we loved staying here and calling it our temporary home.  thank you!",location
"This is an adorable cottage up in Topanga. The morning and evening views from the garden are great, and thereâs a wonderful breeze that catches the porch. It is up in the mountains, so you may see a spider or hear a coyote, but for us that just made the whole thing better. The place is beautifully decorated and very cozy. You can tell the hosts care a lot about their guests. They were also so kind, taking time to chat with us, suggesting outings, telling us the spots to eat... we felt so welcome. ",location
"My partner and I loved staying at Ken and Alice's beautiful Topanga cottage. The space was super cozy and very clean. The location is incredible! We were in the area for a family event in LA and even with a busy schedule, had time for tail runs and climbing in the neighboring state parks as well as downtown sight seeing. There are amazing hiking and running trails just around the corner. The views of the mountains from the back porch are stunning and offer a wonderful way to relax with your morning coffee. Ken and Alice have a wealth of knowledge about the local attractions and are happy to give recommendations. This location was exactly what we were looking for, a short commute to the city while also being a quiet retreat in the mountains. We will definitely stay here again next time we are in LA!",location
"If you want peace and quiet without sacrificing the convenience of city amenities - this is the place to go!  The scenery is beautiful, and both the beach and pretty much everything you can think of (groceries, restaurants, cinemas, shopping) is 10-20 minutes away.<br/>Thanks Alice and Ken, we had a great time!",location
Alice and Ken are wonderful and responsive hosts and it was a pleasure to stay at their cottage.  The cottage is very private and we truly enjoyed the lovely garden where we were greeted by bunnies each morning.  We would look forward to staying again in the future.,location
"This is our fourth stay but it sure wonât be our last.  Ken and Alice are sweethearts, always ready to address any small thing. That and the lovely garden makes this property the best buy in LA.  You may need some cooking consumables but there are paper goods and cooking equipment so a three course meal is easy.  Susan provides an cheerful assortment of towels, cotton sheets and brightly colored plates and bowls that put most Air BnB hosts to shame.",clean
"Spectacular view over the mountains and far away from the traffic jams, that steal your time in the city. Alice and Ken always had an ear for me and help me a lot with some personal things to organize. The place has everything and is so nice to either get sunburned or watch the sundown. Unfortunately I havenât managed to visit the park just a few minutes away. For me everything was perfect and Iâd return any time.",location
Everything was amazing,clean
"Alice and Ken were extremely hospitable, and the location and access was perfect. The cottage is beautiful and would highly recommend staying with them.",location
A lovely garden setting & a cozy cottage in a fantastic location to everything.,location
"I've stayed at numerous Airbnbs all over the world and this is my first negative review.  Overall, it was a pretty crappy experience.  Parking could barely accommodate a compact car.  Path to cabin is VERY treacherous and steep.  Cabin layout very funky.  Head space in bedroom (upstairs) ridiculous due to roof pitch.  Literally had to crawl into and out of bed.",location
"We enjoyed our stay at this sweet cozy cottage very much. It was well equipped, with a wonderful sunny yard and very welcoming hosts. Will definitely stay here again in the future.",location
"We loved everything about our stay at Ken and Alice's home in Topanga. The location was perfect for our needs -- a beautiful, natural setting, close to the ocean and several state parks. The sweet home fit our party of four perfectly. The living space is colorful and cozy, and the outdoor area has a couple spacious seating areas, beautiful native plants and flowers, hummingbirds, even a few friendly lizards. We loved it. Ken and Alice weren't intrusive, but were very attentive to our needs. They responded immediately when we had a couple requests, and Ken provided interesting information about the history of Topanga and local attractions. It couldn't have been better!",location
"Highly Recommend!! <br/>There arenât enough stars available (well maybe in Ken & Aliceâs backyard there are!) to give the number of stars this location and hosts deserve! Yes it is just like the pictures, but pictures can't convey everything-When you arrive there...there is a warmth to this stay, cottage, grounds and hosts that just say, âhome.â What a great place to relax, unwind and unplug (even though you can stay as plugged in as you want to with lighting fast internet and cell phone service). Ken and Alice are generous caring hosts, their cottage, with its private grounds is just spectacular. They give guests their space but are right there if you need them!  Inside, there is everything you need for your stay, cooking utensils, pots, pans dishes and a great array of soaps and lotions in the bathroom. You are away from it all and yet all of Los Angeles is right around the corner, city, beach, mountains and hiking trails. A little bit of heaven here on earth. Highly recommend. Donât forget and sit in the backyard at night. You might even see a meteor shower!!",location
I spent 3 months here while transitioning in So Cal and wanted to experience Topanga before I committed to a more permanent place. I went in with the mindset that I would be glamping and country living..that is exactly what i experienced. It was a beautiful experience in an amazing location that is super close to 101 freeway in one direction  and PCH in the (Website hidden by Airbnb) was an extremely grounding and earthy experience and if that is what you are looking for I highly recommend! Ken and Alice are very kind people and very knowledgable about the city. The terrain is spectacular and much canyon magic! <br/><br/>Thank you Ken and Alice for making Bo and I feel so welcome!,location
"I loved this cottage. Alice snd Ken were quick to respond and always helpful and supportive. <br/>My friend and I were staying there together and she had the bedroom upstairs while I slept on the couch downstairs. I never had to pull it out into a bed and because it was incredibly comfortable to sleep on as a couch. <br/>Because it was winter it was a little bit cold at first but they provided us with space heaters and tons of the softest fluffiest blankets ever. It was very comfortable and we enjoyed our stay. They were helpful and responsive to all our needs. I love the neighborhood and the view, the tall ceilings the wood floors and that there were some natural products available for dish soap but there was no shampoo in the bathroom FYI so you will want to bring your own like we did. I would stay there again it was a lovely place to be.",location
"We enjoyed our stay at Alice and Kenâs place! It is right down the road from pure land farms, where one of us was attending a workshop, and we think itâs the closest Airbnb to that spot. <br/>We got to meet two donkeys that Alice and Ken are hosting, and we even got to pet one of them :)<br/>If youâre into Topangaâs vibe, this little home will be just right for you.",location
"The Topanga Private View Cottage ran by Ken and Alice Mazur is a terrific place to stay. The accommodations are quaint and cozy, with amenities that were better than all the hotels that I am familiar with in the area. I stayed for an entire month for work, and felt like I was in a home away from home. Ken and Alice are incredible hosts, and they bent over backwards to make sure my stay was pleasant. Not once was I uncomfortable or displeased with my stay, and I would stay there again in a heartbeat. The views are gorgeous, lots of food options around within 5-10 minutes, and if youâre a musician or in the industry, Ken is a guy you want to talk to. Heâs seen it all and met everyone, and it was great hearing his stories about the music industry, as well as getting insight from him about music in general. Heâs a musical treasure!<br/><br/>Beautiful people, beautiful spot, wonderful experience!",location
"We've been living at Alice & Ken's place for over 4 months now, when our initial plan was to book the place for just 2 months. We loved the space so much, we extended our stay. <br/><br/>My wife & I have been working remotely out of this place and we love it. The WiFi is even better than what we were getting in San Francisco and the place receives a lot of sun; so it's bright throughout the day. Our golden retriever spends most of his day in the front yard chasing rabbits and squirrels. The house is located very close to the road; so its easy to get in and out. Doordash delivers to this location and Calabasas is just a short 10 min drive for any purchases. There are a ton of great hikes around the house and we spend evenings taking those. <br/><br/>Alice & Ken are very thoughtful in making sure that our stay is super comfortable. They are always a call / message away if we need any assistance.",location
"This place is a gem. A quaint home built by Ken that can easily accommodate a family of 4. We have a pet and we moved out of San Francisco and we loved the place. Our initial plan was to spend only 2 months at Ken & Alice's place but we ended up spending almost 6 months here. <br/><br/>Ken & Alice are super helpful and made us feel very comfortable throughout our stay. There is a beautiful outdoor cafe that's walking distance from this place where you can work remotely. This place has excellent WiFi (can manage to handle 2 concurrent Zoom calls without any issue). There are a ton of places one can visit around Topanga and if you love hiking, this is a great centre point. Overall, we highly recommend staying at this place short or long-term.",location
This was a fantastic place to stay! Itâs a great cottage in the canyon and the backyard is dreamy. Ken and Alice were wonderful hosts and also great to chat with. I was there for a month and would definitely go back - highly recommend!,location
"Nice little ""rustic"" style cabin nestled in the canyon. Not the closest to downtown LA if you're looking to go into the city frequently, but a quaint place with a huge patio area with hammocks and chairs with a beautiful view of the Santa Monicas.<br/><br/>For the house itself: My friend and I worked remotely while living here for a few weeks and the Wi-Fi was strong enough for simultaneous Zoom calls. Good kitchen for cooking on your own, strong shower, spacious bathroom, and extremely comfortable bed (although it's on the ground). Alice and Ken were also very welcoming and communicative.<br/><br/>There are definitely ants and plenty of tiny bugs that get into the house, but not sure that can be avoided in the mountains. The washer and dryer can also be a bit tricky to get items clean / dry after just one cycle. Finally, FYI that there's a trek up quite a few stairs and a mulch path from the parking area to the house that can be daunting at night.<br/><br/>Overall, however, good place for a long term stay and would recommend.",location
"Alice and Ken were amazing and so welcoming upon my arrival , they explained everything in detail and made me feel at home . The cottage is up the hill with some steps up and has incredible expansive views of the mountains peaks. I truly enjoyed  their garden and plants every time of the day. Thank you so very much !",location
"This was absolutely the best Airbnb cottage weâve ever stayed at. Other than the steep walk up the stairs, once youâre there the views are great, the air is clean and you can watch the sun rise and set. The lights in the garden really add great character to the place.  Ken and Alice are wonderful hosts.",location
Alice and Ken's place is beautiful and beautifully tucked into the heart hills of Topanga.  We are grateful for the opportunity and will be grateful to stay here again in the near future.,location
"Beautiful, private cottage in Topanga Canyon! You cannot beat the location and the private patio / yard. <br/><br/>We spent an entire month here and loved every minute of it! You are surrounded by nature and amazing trails but also only 5 minutes to some great restaurants in both directions. <br/><br/>Ken and Alice are both lovely and great hosts! They were very accommodating and quick to respond to any requests we had. Our car battery even died while we were there and Ken spent an hour with us trying to jump itâ¦talk about kind people! <br/><br/>We would definitely visit again and think this is the perfect short term or long term stay for all  travelers.",location
"Ken and Alice are responsive hosts who are very knowledgable about the area. They have a beautiful setting to relax in both inside and out, minutes away from trails to explore.",location
"My first airbnb experience. I loved it. Screw hotels. Ken is an amazing host. Unfortunately we didnât get to meet Alice, but they are very busy people who are doing great things with animals. Their place is very cool in a great spot. Just far enough away to not feel the stress of the city, but close enough to have the convenience of living in a city. Looking forward to doing it again. Thank you Ken!",location

"If you're looking for a nice, scenic place to stay where you will be undisturbed by the usual craziness of life, you'll enjoy Alice & Ken's place. It sits in the hills of Topanga with a view of more beautiful hills.

The home was a great space, clean, has great amenities, bedrooms were clean and comfortable and the outdoor patio was nice to relax when the weather is nice.  Great view from the front patio.

Overall, we had a great stay. My family would love to stay at their place again in their next visit. ",clean

"I was looking for a place to stay big enough to accommodate my family that were arriving from Virginia, Pennsylvania & Florida. I was impressed with the pictures shown & as we arrived to check-in, it was exactly as how it looked online. Richard & Valerie were very understading of our situation & definitely accommodating. The house is very neat, loved the decor, location is close to all the good restaurants & markets. I would most definitely recommend this place.",location
"The home is located in a very nice and quiet area.  Upon entering the home, the overall condition looked great.  There were a few issues here and there but Valerie and Richard quickly resolved them.  It is worthy to note that, although we rented the entire home, Valerie and Richard both live in the home with us, in an adjacent connected room by the kitchen.  The walls are also quite thin and we were able to hear each others conversation who were in separate rooms down the hall. We did not stay at the home for the entirety, usually just to sleep but I can see this as a potential privacy issue.  ",clean
"we had live in this house for about two weeks. A very nice, quite place to live at. The house has great view and  convenient location. You can get to restaurants, gas station and shopping centers in just 10mins. Valerie & Richard are very nice landlord. They always make fast respond for all our requirement and questions. In short, five stars place that we are looking forward to stay again in the future!",location
"Jayâs place was the perfect place for the weekend. It was spacious enough for my friend and I, clean, and had everything we needed.

Tracey was a great host!  I would definitely stay at her place again. She greeted us at her cottage and showed us everything we needed to know about the house. Gave us tips about the neighborhood and even drove us around the neighborhood to show us where the main streets were and where we could find restaurants and grocery stores. Her guest cottage is a perfect spot in a beautiful setting. It was very quiet and close to everything. We went out to eat several times in nearby studio city. Hollywood is just down the road 10 minutes away. The views from her place were awesome!,location

had a wonderful time staying here with my family.<br/>the house is clean and valerie was quick enough to respond to our needs.<br/>you need a car to stay here...lots of different restaurants/shops around.<br/>a tranquil place to stay with the hustle and bustle of LA.<br/>would love to go back and stay here again.,clean
"The hostess was there upon our arrival and gave us a tour of the house. It is located in a quiet neighborhood. The house itself has 2 parts/living quarters that share a kitchen wall and dining door. It is possible to hear groups on either side of the wall, which is why there is a curfew. The house itself was quaint with just enough amenities to keep me and my friends satisfied. The beds are big enough and very comfortable.<br/>The hostess was nice, but a little too attentive during our stay. People can take it as either positive or negative, but for people in our 20s trying to sleep in, it was not positive.<br/>This place is good for renters who won't be at the house long (only sleep), have a family, are old(er), or don't mind the hostess having so many rules. <br/>The hostess has had problematic renters in the past, which she informed me and my friends of constantly during the tour. <br/>It would be better for both parties if the renters are not in their 20s.

"We had a very good welcome. Valerie answer very quickly at our resquests. The aera was very quiet. There is a lot of good asian restaurant and shops around. The house is very well maintened, exactly like described. Just to know it's very far from the major point of interest like Hollywood, because of the big traffic jam.",clean
"We really enjoyed our stay at this vacation rental for so many reasons and to make it easier on the reader, I will put down our feedback in points:<br/>- House: It was exactly like the photos. Super clean and beautifully decorated. The best thing however was the awesome view of LA (both day and night) from the patio, dining area, and sitting room all of which overlooked the city; s (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) beautiful!!!<br/>Commodities: It had basically everything we needed. The only thing we kind of missed was cable TV but we were out most of the days so it didn't matter that much in the end.<br/>House location: We love LA and have stayed at different locations in this big city a lot throughout the years but out of all of them, we really loved Rowland Heights. It was apparent that this community takes great care in keeping its community up to the best standard from its streets, to its malls, to the friendliness of the people living in it! <br/>Valerie and Richard: Two very helpful hosts that did everything to make our stay comfortable.<br/><br/>We will definitely stay at this accommodation again if we are ever in LA.<br/><br/>Amel ",clean
My family's experience was great. The place had a great view and was very comfortable.,location
Tracey's cottage was a real treat. Tracey was there for check-in to make sure we have everything we need. The house is very quiet and private and we spent most of the time on one of the patios that are both shaded and private and have stunning views. It was also very clean and the fresh flowers were a lovely addition. We tried to extend our stay but unfortunately the cottage was already booked. ,location

"Jay's place is super convenient in Beverly Hills. I was able to walk just about everywhere, from Barney's to Chipotle, Santa Monica to Venice Beach. Her studio was clean, stylish, and properly furnished. Jay was also kind enough to let me check in early in addition to being responsive. All in all, I felt this was the perfect way to visit southern California.",location

"Excellent location - just a few minutes walk from Rodeo Drive and some fantastic bars, restaurants and cafes on S Beverly Dr. <br/><br/>Nice and quiet in the evening and mornings too. <br/><br/>Property was exactly as shown - in a secure building - and host very quick to respond to questions before and during our stay. Really good value.",location
"The Hollywood Hills Cottage exceeded our expectations and providwd everything we were looking for. Tracey was very friendly, responded quickly, and made us feel welcome. The cottage was charming and close to attractions, shops, and dining. We would enjoy staying again...",location
Tracey's home is a gem in the hills of Hollywood! She was more than helpful with directing me to places around town and her home has the most breathtaking view. I will definitely be staying again!,location
"Hey sorry for this belated review.<br/><br/>My father and I enjoyed the house very much, it's very spacious clean and comfortable. The view off the hill was very nice. Almost everything you need is provided in the house, and it's very close to the town centre if you travel by car. A+ rating house!",clean
I liked the house very much. It was clean and they were nice to us. I hope we have chance to live here next time.:) The view from the house was great.,location
"We stayed for a month and it was great. <br/>The house was clean and well  equipped with anything you might need.   It is very spacious and comfortable.  The location was ideal for us, right off the 101. <br/>Our host Tracey met as when we arrived and was very informative and always available. <br/>We loved our stay and look forward to booking for next year!!",clean
The property was in a superb location and looked great with our Mustang GT parked outside. Jay was excellent in making us feel welcomed and her comminication with us was excellent as this was the one thing worrying me before the trip. Would I stay at her flat again? Yes I would 100%,location
Awesome location at a great price.,location
"Location cannot be beat. One block from Rodeo Drive on a quiet, beautiful upscale residential street in a restored hotel from 1924... walking distance to pretty much everything Beverly Hills has to offer. We did have an issue with the TV and the owner promptly sent her manager to replace the remote control. One word of advice, however: if you rent a car, make sure the car rental agency gives you a vehicle with California plates. We got one with Washington state plates, meaning we could not use the parking permit the owner provided without fear that we'd get ticketed. It's a local ordinance in Beverly Hills (and maybe other jurisdictions as well) that cars parked on residential streets must have CA plates. On the other hand, the Saks 5th Avenue parking lot is just down the street and it's only $10 per 24-hour period, so no big deal if you have to pay.  All in all, I would highly recommend this place to anyone!",location
Valerie greeted us and gave us a brief tour/info about the house. She was welcoming and made sure to see if there was anything extra we might need. The neighborhood was quiet and felt safe. The house was clean and recently remodeled - the beds were very comfortable! Would definitely stay here again!,clean
"This studio is charming, full of natural light, and extremely well located in the heart of Beverly Hills. A great spot from which to explore the neighborhood with many cafes and restaurants within walking distance. The bed is super comfy and we loved the hardwood floors and the view from the third floor. The building is unique and architecturally interesting as well. I had a great stay here and recommend it!",location
"The hosts Val and Richard met my husband and sons at the vacation rental.  They were very friendly and accommodating.  The house was very clean and beds super comfy.  They made themselves available for any issues that would arise.  My husband and sons traveled to Southern California from Nevada to enjoy a family event and chose the Airbnb location due to its proximity to the event.  We encouraged Valerie and Richard to expand the television channels from one English channel as all others were only in Asian languages.  We also encouraged them to include a percolating coffee pot, and an iron.  Washer and dryer was not available unless you stay for 4 days.  Not really sure why they cannot be made available even on short stays.  And finally, there seems to be some sewage issues related to flushing your toilet paper down the toilet.  They asked we dispose of toilet paper in waste basket.  This issue seems to be something that I believe most would like to see resolved and it sounds as though they are working on it.  Other than that, a good stay in a clean and comfortable home.<br/>",clean
"Place was clean, tidy and in a great location.  Communication with Jay was really quick and check in was easy.",clean
"Hopefully the host will change and update the bedding to clean bedding, new towels and a doona as there were no blankets to keep warm.  The floors were dirty and I had to vacuum. So hopefully everything will be updated.  The location was perfect!",clean
"Valerie ( I didn't get a chance to meet Richard) was an exceptional host. She made sure everything we needed was there and ready when we arrived and made sure everything was going well during our stay. All around fantastic experience, and the house itself was phenomenal. ",clean
"My family stayed for 2 months at the house, so we had a concrete experience. First of all about Valerie & Richard they are indeed a super host there response time is quite fast and they are very cooperative, we requested a lot of stuff due to our long stay and they complied to everything. During the stay when ever a problem arises they always act fast to solve it.<br/><br/>For the House its truly amazing. Enough space for a medium sized family. The Beds are quite comfy and the house has everything u need for your stay. The neighbor hood is perfect for a family stay. Its quite quite and relaxing. The best thing about the house is the view and and the outside patio, we used to have our breakfast in the sun outside (atleast in the days where we had sun). <br/><br/>For those who we were wondering yes the house consists of 2 parts the Main house and the guest and they are connected at the kitchen wall. We didn't face any privacy or noise issues during our 2 month stay so it shouldn't be an issue to anyone.<br/><br/>So in general if we were in LA for another long stay we would love to stay here again.

"A quick stay, but clean, great location, and comfy bed! Would definitely stay again.",clean
Great location. Nice apartment that could have been cleaner. Difficult communicating with the host at times.,location
The room is great. Was clean and spacious. Parking is a little tricky since you have to be careful to park in the correct zone. Otherwise everything was amazing and I really enjoyed my stay here,clean
Would definitely recommend this place for the price. Location couldnât be better! Great stay.,location
Do not stay there. It was a nightmare.,location

"Jay is easy to deal with, quick to respond, helpful and provides lots of local tips. The Airbnb is exactly as described. <br/> The location is unbeatable and the parking pass a great help (be sure to read and follow his parking directions: if you leave your car parked on street cleaning mornings you will get a ticket, so read the signs). <br/>We would definitely stay here next time we are in town. It's a good base to explore LA.",location
"Cozy, clean, and comfortable. It's in a nice area, and a short walk from a lot of good restaurants. Would for sure stay again if I'm in the area.",clean

"Jays place was perfect. Great location, great value, and great hospitality. I would highly recommend for a work trip, or if you just need a place to crash while visiting LA.",location
"The place looks nothing like the photos. There is no white bed, no carpet, nor that marble looking table that's pictured, not even vases or anything that's in these photos on here.... Apartment is actually a ran down sort of scary place with a METAL bed, black dirty looking sheets, mattress that feels & looks like it's been picked up from Goodwill .. Sink knobs in the bathroom are broken... It's the first bad airbnb experience I've had and I've stayed in airbnb worldwide for years....",clean
Great location. Nice place to stay.,location
"I thoroughly enjoyed the place, what a nifty little bedsit that came equipped with adapter and hygienic wipes (my favourite!). Portable heater came in handy on those few chilly nights, and that duvet was just the right thing to sink into at end of day<br/>And the welcome bottle - a lovely little gesture that added to that personal touch. <br/>Thanks so much for being such an easy host to work with from beginning to end",location

"This was our second stay in Phoene's home. The house was lovely!  We especially enjoyed spending time together in the patio area watching the amazing view of city lights.  The house is better than the pictures on Airbnb as it has been remodeled with new floors and updated bathroom.  The location is perfect and near everything.  The neighborhood was very quiet and peaceful.  Overall, I would certainly recommend the home to anyone traveling to this area.",location
Fabulous! Convenient clean and great communication from host. Highly recommend.,clean
"Small but clean space , great location for meetings and work around Beverly Hills and sunset Blvd.",location
This stay was a nightmare!!!!!!!! Room looks NOTHING like on pictures!!! I have traveled so much and always had beautiful experience but this host ruined for me! Was no accommodative at all which was not a problem. The problem was when I entered the room that smelled like smoke! There is NO AC instead there is old broken fan. Room looks nothing like on pictures! There is an old metal bed with a stained mattress. That wasnât an issue still until I realize the sheets werenât even changed and there were hair from whoever slept there! I immediately started trying to teach host. After multiple calls and texts I had to open a case that took hours to hear from host !  Still in a process of trying to get my refund! I spend in room 6 hours and at night my reservation was canceled due to no help from host! First night in LA I had to spend in car after surgery! Shame on this host! Be aware!,clean
"I've never given a bad review of an Airbnb in my life until now. As a host myself, I like to think that I'm easy to please as I understand the other side of hosting and how easily things can be missed - it happens! No big deal. I chose Jay's place because on the front page of the listing it states ""We are taking every precaution necessary to sanitize everything"". Prior to booking, I also enquired with the host if it would be ok to bring my registered + trained service animal who goes everywhere with me. The host's response was ""Great!"" and then she invited me to book. Sounds good, but unfortunately neither of those things were true.<br/><br/>Check in was a breeze and the host offered to let me come an hour early. I came a little bit after checkout and the code was accurate. When I walked into the apartment the bedding was clean as well as the couch cover. But upon actually unpacking, I began to notice how dirty the place was. There were long black hairs on the floor and sticky spots. I went to reach for the mircowave and noticed sauce covered fingerprints on the handle. I went to check for cutlery, and not only was there only butter knives in the drawer, but a stack of food soiled napkins and old soy sauce packages that had dried and actually stuck to the drawer. I tried to wash my hands, no hand soap in the whole apartment. No hand towels in the bathroom or kitchen. When I went to put some prescriptions into the fridge, I noticed that the freezer was full of frost and the door was broken open so it wouldn't close. It seemed as if the whole kitchen was missed in the cleaning. I text Jay and kindly mentioned that the cleaners might have missed a few things. She offered to come re-clean it for me which I was grateful for. It was annoying to have to eat my dinner on the rooptop (which is an awesome bonus btw!) but like I said, I understand that things can me missed - no big deal. When I came back in she was just finishing swiffering, I noticed that the host has long black hair herself although she said she had someone renting it prior to me coming? Who knows. <br/><br/>After her re-clean I noticed that things had been wiped down but unfortunately the freezer door was still broken and when I followed up with a text she told me that ""it should stay on and one day she'll have to unplug it to melt the frost"". Kinda just told me to deal with it. Queue me spending an hour trying to break off the frost to ensure that my prescriptions stay frozen. This obviously left a pile of frost on the floor which I proceeded to clean up and I was shocked with how entirely dirty the rag was. I began to actually look at the floor and it hadn't been mopped at all. There were sticky spots all over the floor as if it hadn't been properly cleaned in ages. I went to grab a glass of water and the glass was covered in fingerprints and lipstick?! At this point I began to be really concerned with the overall cleanliness in the place. No hand soap? Drawers and dishes dirty? No cutlery except for knives?<br/><br/>To top it all off, there was a RAGER next door until 3:30 am. I informed the host around 12:30 and at 1:30 there was a knock on the door where the neighbour apologized for the noise, but it continued until about 4am. I was totally done. I called Airbnb and explained the whole situation to them and told them I'd be checking out the next day.<br/><br/>When I informed Jay I was checking out she just told me that I need to submit an ""alteration request so she can re-rent it out again"". Of course, she just didn't accept it and kept stalling. I checked out the next day and I have yet to get a refund for the days I didn't stay there, let alone the money I lost from my prescriptions being ruined from the freezer. When I got a response from Airbnb's help centre after submitting all my evidence, I was told that ""the host said that you brought your PET which is against her house rules"" and they closed the case. What a scam!! <br/><br/>I was so dissapointed that Jay would lie to them like that when all of the proof is in our message thread. It's now 2 weeks later and I'm deep into a investigation with Airbnb and Jay is being anything but responsive. What a nightmare. This has been a terrible experience and it's hosts like these who give hosts a bad name. The location is great but staying here really isn't worth the headache of a dishonest host.",clean
"This is a very sweet and practical space. The  building is clean, quiet and centrally located. If you need a simple, quiet, sweet spot this studio apartment is a perfect fit. Even thought itâs small it has big sunny windows that allow a nice breeze and light to come through and the bed was super comfortable too! Thanks again!",clean
Clean apartment and excellent location. Will book again in the future.,clean
"This location was fantastic for exploring Beverly Hills! We did have a few issues though. The wifi was absolutely horrific and did not work AT ALL so we couldnât watch Netflix and my friend had to use a hotspot for work, the place looks nothing like the pictures, the towels/blankets seem old and the cleanliness of them was questionable.",location
Great place for friends visiting LA as the location is perfect! Safe and quiet neighborhood yet right off one of the biggest streets in the city! The studio itself is small and clean with a cute colorful bathroom! Definitely recommend this place!,location
"Jayâs place was lovely. I booked it for my sister who was recovering from surgery and Jay was incredibly responsive, kind, and accommodating. It was also located in a great area central to Beverly Hills.",location
I have stayed in this unit before. I booked it again last minute (so lucky it was avail) as I was having work done in my house and needed a place to stay asap. Jay made some design changes since my last stay which were really nice. It was super (Website hidden by Airbnb) important detail during the current climate. Very happy I could stay here again! Highly recommend!,clean
Great communication!,clean
Awesome host! Was able to help me with a last min booking! Super helpful and friendly! The place was perfect and she made sure that I had a comfortable stay,clean
Jay was a great host. Very attentive and communicative and the stay itself is great and in a very good location. Highly recommend this Airbnb stay!,location
"This studio is an amazing little gem, in what I would consider the best neighborhood in LA. Be careful because you are  only steps away from Saks and Chanel. I was worried about parking, but the street permit provided by the host was very simple once you figure out the days<br/>and streets. The apartment itself is super cute,  perfect for one person (maybe even a coupe). I used to have a favorite go to Airbnb spot in West Hollywood but it has now been replaced by this location!! I hope to go back again and again! Super clean and the host is very responsive. I slept like a baby there. Very peaceful and I think a great deal. Highly recommended! ð",location
"Well worth the booking! Detailed instructions, smooth check in, and a nice spot to stay at!",clean
Really beautiful historic building within steps to shops and restaurants. Definitely check out the rooftop views. I would stay again.,location
"Booked this room because it looked clean and location was good. When I arrived I received a long paragraph of instructions of what not to do. Never saw any host or person to greet and ensure place was up to par. Usually I rent an Airbnb a nice greeting from host is common. Upon arrival, bed and couch was different furniture from photos in listing. But I didnât think any big deal, and quickly got dressed for dinner. When I arrived back to the room I noticed several things that disturbed me. Bed linens werenât clean and had white spots all over sheets. Couch was covered with black cloth that had traces of animal hair. Throw rug was rolled up and placed under tv stand. Towels in bathroom smelled moldy and not fresh. Kitchen utensils such as forks, had specks of food. The remote for tv did not work, so I never turned it on. WiFi password given was incorrect, I was notified of the new one and I still couldnât log on. Overall smell of apartment was dingy and needed extensive clean. Which would explain when the gentleman that arrived to clean room informed me he was new, and it was his first time in the building. The condition and communication from host of this unit was something expected if it was booked in a not so prestigious neighborhood equivalent to Beverly Hills. When I contacted the host, via number listed, there was no answer, so I left a voicemail. And I messaged Host through Airbnb app. She responded four hours later. When she did, I told her about rooms condition, and she was apologetic but offered to refund a cleaning fee and free night of stay. Due to travel obligations and uncomfortable experience I declined offer. I donât like leaving bad reviews, but as someone who has worked in hospitality for over 15 years this wasnât a good experience, especially for Beverly Hills.",clean
"great location, perfect to relax in, clean quiet and comfy!",location
"Jayâs place was greatâa nice, central location in Beverly Hills in walking distance of all the stores, restaurants, and coffee shops. A beautiful, quiet neighborhood! If you plan to stay at Jayâs and you plan to rent a car, ask your car service to give you California license plates. I guess Beverly Hills only allows CA license plates to park on the street, so if you have out-of-state plates, you need to pay for parking in a lot. There are a few not too far from Jayâs place ranging from $10-$15/day, otherwise Jay would provide a parking pass to borrow for your stay. WiFi was a bit slow.",location
"Jay's place was sparkling clean and just as advertised.  The historic building was quiet and its location is tucked away just off of Rodeo Drive in a lovely tree-lined residential neighborhood. Jay was an amazing host whose communication was prompt and tips/recommendations were fantastic.  I would highly recommend staying at Jay's place if you are wanting to see Beverly Hills or any of the many sights that the neighboring regions have to offer (LaBrea Tar Pits, Hollywood Bowl, Universal, Westwood/UCLA, Bel Air/Brentwood, Beach Communities such as Santa Monica/Venice Beach/Manhattan Beach, etc...).  <br/>In the event that you are heat sensitive and travelling during the hot weather season, I would note that the unit is without air-conditioning, but is cooled with a fan.<br/>I would highly recommend Jay's place and look forward to visiting it again the next time that I am in the area!",clean
"Jay is truly an outstanding host. I stayed at this beautiful apartment while visiting family and the location and price was unbeatable. Plenty of shopping and sightseeing nearby, very walkable but parking is also accessible. The space is equipped with everything you may need during your stay. Jay even left a bottle of wine and suggestions for where to catch great views. Jay offers plenty of privacy, and at the same time is available for anything I needed at any time. There is a lot of attention to detail and I really felt right at home. I canât wait to come back! Take care Jay and thank you for the wonderful stay!",location

Location was perfect for foodies like us. Tons of restaurants in the neighborhood. It was a great stay AGAIN!",location
The house of Richard and Valerie is perfect from the inside out.  The house is complete for a comfortable stay for the whole family.  The view is spectacular.

Great place and a great host,location
"Jay's place is great, sparkling clean, and gives you everything you need to lay your head for a few nights as you move through LA. Centrally located in Beverly Hills the location is great and in a pristine neighborhood. Only issue is the parking, beware those street signs, Jay provides a parking pass but even with a pass you have to dodge street sweeping penalties on Wednesdays etc. Lovely space overall.",clean

"Jay is an awesome host.  She was cheerful and extremely accommodating.  I was incredibly surprised to see how extravagant and historic the property was!  Staying in her building was such a pleasant experience, and I was genuinely impressed by how close she was too one of the toniest parts of Beverly Hills!  I canât wait to book with her again. I am brand new to CA  and am navigating a lot of new things.  Jay listened with compassion and understanding, and I will always appreciate this.  She made me feel right at home!  I cannot wait to book another stay with her again. I hated leaving!! lol",location
The house is very cozy and nestled in a great neighborhood with spectacular views that can be appreciated from both patios as well as the bedroom. The neighborhood is quiet and located near the popular Runyon Canyon trails as well as a quick 15 minute ride into central Hollywood. <br/><br/>The place came with lots of convenient amenities that worked for me as a longer term guest. The Washer and Dryer and the dedicated parking spot was key for me as well.  <br/><br/>The host was very responsive when I needed to address any concerns. <br/>I would highly recommend to anyone staying short or long term. Will stay again!!!,location
"Spanish Manior is gorgeous and in a great central location! Everything is high-end, from the appliances and linens, to the amazing entertainment system. Absoluty stunning bedroom and bath spaces and the kitchen and family room area was fantastic and comfortable! Loved the pool and hot tub---and not to mention the outdoor fireplace and Tiki bar. Bill was a great host, always available by text and checked in on us often to see if we needed anything. It was an amazing home overall and a great place for friends to reconnect. Would absolutely stay here again. We had a wonderful time!",location
"If your looking for a taste of the Hollywood Glamour life with all the homey touches of comfort and the perfect location for a family or small group stay in Beverly Hills, Hollywood, Los Angeles and the beach than this is your PERFECT destination.  Bill is a fabulous host and provides everything you will need for a fantastic stay, cook inn his beautiful kitchen, relax by the pool and mix up a cocktail in the backyard Tiki bar.  The linens and towel provide the perfect setting for the amazing bedrooms and bathrooms.  There is nothing left to want if you stay in this house!  I give it a 5-Star rating.",location
This property is amazing! The owner is awesome and friendly! Two thumbs up!!,location
Bill's place was more than spacious for me and my family's needs! Their home has all of the right modern touches and the downstairs lounge was our favorite place to hang out. Communication was great and so was the location (very central!). I couldn't be more grateful for allowing us to stay here for my birthday weekend!,location
We had a girls weekend here for my cousin who is getting married and it was absolutely amazing! The house is very spacious with a lot of bedrooms and bathrooms. The pool and hot tub are an awesome place to hang out and spend the days. Everywhere we went for dinner or night life was pretty close. Itâs a great location on a quiet street. The owners are also super easy to work with and very accommodating. Loved their beautiful home!,location
Bill's place was as advertised- spacious with endless amenities for the perfect Los Angeles get away. The backyard was perfectly manicured and ideal for a lovely Sunday BBQ by the pool after a long weekend. We appreciated Bill's attention to detail and responsiveness. The location is also ideal for anyone trying to be close to all that local LA has to offer. Thanks again Bill!,location
"Bill's place was amazing from start to finish. We were there for our daughters graduation from USC. He had flowers and a nice congratulation sign upon arrival! The house was spacious for my family of 4 and the grandparents. The location was  great for getting to USC, downtown LA and Hollywood. The backyard and pool were spectacular, it was a bit cool so we didn't get as much use of it as we would have liked, however the house was cozy. The beds were so comfortable and great showers with plenty of towels. Check in was easy and the house book he provided was  helpful. We all really enjoyed the place, thanks Bill!",location
"Billâs home was beautifully decorated, comfortable and had lots of charming details. The backyard is so beautiful and relaxing! We would definitely stay here again. ",location
The location of this house is ideal. We were able to walk to LACMA and a few places to eat nearby. The backyard is perfect for entertaining a few or a lot of friends. It is ideal because there are several different spots to enjoy the space. We spent most of our time in the backyard! The kitchen is well equiped with everything you could need. All the beds are kings with everyone having a good nights sleep! We had 2 grandparents with us so the 2 bedrooms on the lower level worked perfectly for us. Would definitely stay here again.,location
"Bill is an incredible host. The house is beautiful, clean, and spacious. It was perfect for our family of 7. So pleasant of space that we found it hard to leave and explore the surroundings. The home was absolute paradise. Hope to be back again someday sooner than later.",clean
"Bills home is nothing short of amazing!  It's great for hosting and is very spacious.  The backyard is awesome and great to BBQ and lounge in the pool on a hot summer LA day.  You almost forget you're right in the middle of LA, to be honest.  Oh and the basement is the icing on the cake!  I would say the only tough part is the permit parking.  Luckily you can find parking fairly easily on Wilshire Blvd. and just walk though the small alley way San Diego Way and you'll be right next to the house very quickly.  <br/><br/>The check-in/out process was great and Bill was extremely responsive and was very nice over the phone.  He even has a little welcome folder full of information about the house itself as well as things to do around the area.  We stayed at his house for four days to use is as a home base on my wedding weekend and even hosted our dinner rehearsal there.  All of my guests loved the house and were very impressed.  <br/><br/>I would definitely recommend!",location
Another great stay with RVB.  All their houses have spectacular view and very private. The place was incredibly clean and so comfortable. We would highly recommend staying here and plan in being back! Working with RVB was a breeze.,location
"Bill was great!  The house was amazing, Accommodated our large family, and we certainly loved the outdoor Space and the downstairs. It was a great place for us to come back and unwind after being out on the town or at the beach all day!<br/>Location was perfect!!<br/>Love tat everyone had king size beds, too!  No complaints!!",location
comfortable home.would recommend friends.,clean
Awsome view and very clean as describe. Can't wait for next stay,clean
Hosts were easy to communicate and assisted us with all of our questions. Views were truly amazing and offered a great background for some really nice pics. Space was just right for my sisters baby shower. Would recommend property to anyone.,location
The place has a gorgeous view in a peaceful and quiet neighborhood. It provided me a holiday with great relaxation and peace of mind. <br/><br/>The house was not only spotless but also provided amenities that are new. <br/><br/>The location is very convenient to get to many popular LA attractions such as the Disneyland. <br/><br/>I will not hesitate to stay with RVB again. <br/>,location
The house was so clean with a very great view. Valerie was also friendly and very communicative. We had a good stay and we recommend this place. ,clean
great well decorated unit in rowland heights lots of asian eating places nearby,location
"RVB's place is perfect for family trips. The house is very tidy and clean, has a lot of space and a fantastic view of the mountains. It is located in a quiet neighborhood which is perfect for relaxation from the busy LA lifestyle.  Richard is the perfect host. He was very friendly and helpful and gave us tips on what to do and where to go in LA. We would definitely recommend this place to others.",location
"We loved RVB's place - it's difficult to find a place for 3 couples to all stay together where one couple doesn't have to sleep on twin beds or on the couch!! RVB's place has 3 bedrooms with 2 queen beds and 1 king bed. Everyone had their own bathroom. The place is very nice, updated decor and appliances, comfortable and quiet. We LOVED the outdoor seating areas and the fantastic view. RVB were  great hosts, communicated clearly and were available whenever we needed something. Highly recommend and would stay here again.

"Place was clean, modern, and very comfortable. Best part was their very responsive communication, which made booking and check in extremely easy. Super nice people and I would highly recommend this rental.",clean
"Richard was very attentive to all our needs, and was flexible with our check in time. We had a great stay, and would definitely recommend this Airbnb.",clean
"Good place to stay, clean, wifi works, just a lot of rules nothing too crazy",clean
"We absolutely LOVED our stay here. We have friends and family in different parts of greater LA and wanted a place where we could comfortably host a few people at a time. This was perfect for that. It is comfortable for one big family or a few smaller families to travel together. There are plenty of different spots around the home to hang out, and the backyard is spectacular. The amount of detail and thought put into each part of this home is remarkable! Also, the location and the communication with Bill were both excellent. I would definitely stay here again.",location
Landlord Bill is very nice and almost prepare everything you need. The yard is fantastic with a lovely pool & jet. We do really spent a beautiful week in Spanish Manor and wish to come back again next year.,location
"This has to be the coolest AirBnB in LA. Not only is there an EPIC salt water pool and hot tub; but there is also an endlessly entertaining JOHNNY MNEMONIC pinball machine downstairs!!!!!!!!! Everything about this place is awesome! This is probably the coolest place to stay in LA, I will definitely be coming back with my friends and would highly suggest it to anyone interested in staying here. Bill is a great and responsive host, Iâve had nothing but good experiences here after staying on two separate occasions with friends.",location
"Our group (4 work colleagues) had an amazing stay at Bill's house this past week. We were in LA on a work trip to do research and installation work at LACMA and our stay at Bill's house was perfect -- we were able to walk to the museum everyday, prepare breakfasts and snacks together in the mornings, and have late night work meetings throughout our stay. There was plenty of space for us to spread out, have our own space in the bedrooms and use the dining room to lay out our papers and notes in the evenings. We got a lot of work done while staying there as a group!<br/><br/>The beds were very comfortable and there were plenty of linens. While it worked for our group of 4, the house easily could have accommodated more people provided they shared beds. The outdoor space was beautiful and well integrated with the indoors, it felt like we were hanging out outside even when inside and visa-versa! The kitchen was well stocked for preparing group meals. The neighborhood was beautiful for evening walks.<br/><br/>Our only issues were related to the fact that this is someone's home, which is to be expected on Airbnb!!! There were a number of air fresheners which were a bit too much for our group. Additionally, a couple of the bedrooms's closets were too filled to be useable by our group. But of course this is to be expected as we are guests in another person's home!<br/><br/>Bill was very communicative throughout the stay and any gaps in communication were easily remedied and addressed. Thank you for a great stay and for accommodating our group on short notice!",space
"Bill and robs house was nothing short of amazing. Bills hospitality canât be matched- met w us when we arrived to show us the beautiful house. Great location, great hospitality, beautiful house, comfortable beds, enough linens for everybody, a fully stocked kitchen to cook anything, plenty of board games, etc. the outdoor space is fantastic. We ended up ordering Ubereats a few times and just eating out back because it was so beautiful. Thereâs a laundry area so you donât go home with dirty clothes, the hot tub heats up super fast and is easy to use and overall the house is perfect. Four couples can easily stay here because thereâs 4 king beds. Zero complaints here. I wish I could move in. We will absolutely stay here if we come back to LA w a big group. I highly recommend booking w bill as I have never had such a warming person and house with any Airbnb.",location
"This home is great for families. We traveled with grown children and our grandchildren.  The two bedrooms downstairs and the two bedrooms upstairs was very convenient.  <br/><br/>The backyard area with pool, eating area and fireplace was a great for outdoor family time,",location
Amazing location. Great neighborhood. The house was clean and we had a great stay. Thank you Bill!,clean
"completely beyond my expectation, this is the best interpretation of vintage style. it has clean and dream location",location
"A very clean place, but the House rules were very controlling.",clean
This was my first airbnb experience.  Coming from Florida I loved being in the hills and the view.  I loved that each bedroom had a sliding door that you could have open when you slept at night without any worry of someone breaking in.  The area felt very safe.  The only thing to take into account is that the bedrooms do not have TV's.  But all in all the house is very nice and centrally located to access LA and Orange County.,location
"The location is amazing, the home is beautiful, but the host is extremely strict and rigid and has a ton of rules. I do not recommend anyone to stay here if you are looking for a homey welcoming experience. This place Iâd only recommend if youâre just coming here to sleep and nothing more. Personally I had a bad experience with the hosts and it caused me to get physically sick from all the stress they put me through. Take these considerations before booking.",location
good attitude with amazing house view,location
"Make sure you communicate clearly with the owner.  They are responsive and reasonable, but you should have some clear understanding in advance of your arrival with respect to sleeping arrangements and cooking requirements.    The home is clean, modern, and quiet with Mountain views.  My family enjoyed our stay.",location
RVB were great hosts. They went out of their way to accommodate us. Awesome vibes. Thanks for everything!,clean
OMG I loved this home. Perfect. Will definitely book again with Valerie. She was so welcoming and an amazing host. I loved the showers the most. View was so dope!,location
"It's our 3rd time to use RVBs house and it's as always a very pleasant experience.  The house feels like our second home in the US.  The place is perfect in every way that we can hope for.  The house is super clean, complete with amenities, it's stylish and spacious and is in a great neighbourhood.   Valerie is a great host and is helpful in every way.  We will definitely consider staying in the house the next time we're in the city.",clean
Host was accommodating. Place was clean and comfortable. ,clean
We stayed for 6 days and loved the experience. Check-in and check-out was a breeze. I can tell it was a quiet neighborhood and as the name suggests home has a spectacular view of the mountains. Disney is about 40 minutes drive and shopping (grocery and food) is ~10 minutes drive. <br/><br/>Would love to repeat the stay if we come to LA!,location
Extremely spacious. Each room gives a couple more than enough space to be comfortable and spread out. The house was very clean and every thing was up-to-date and new. The view from the patio was outstanding!,location
I nice house with a terrific view and very responsive hosts.,location
"Richard and Valerie, you two were incredibly accommodating from the moment we requested to book this airbnb! It was very last minute but you two were quick to recommend places to visit and the entire place was cleaned out and beautifully set. The only slight quirk was the other couple set in the adjacent guest room-it scared one of us in the middle of the night as we had not known in advance about other guests that separated only by a wall. Otherwise, thank you so much for letting us stay: itâs a beautiful place with a great view of the bright hills!",clean
Wonderful place to stay,location

Great place!  When i return to los angeles i want to stay here again,location
"Jay is the best host.  I really can find no fault in her, so I shanât look for any ð.  The space is divine.  The location is priceless.  The overall experience was simply wonderful.  I stayed for a month (in between residences), and I would stay again.",location
"Jay's place is in an amazing location - quiet, reaxing, but only walking distance the hustle and bustle of rodeo drive.  Having all of that plus a parking space was a gamechanger.<br/><br/>The apartment itself was clean, had everything I needed, and has a very interesting design and comfortable at the same time.  <br/><br/>I would highly recommend this place and will definitely stay the next time I am in LA :)",clean
"What was not to love about my stay at this beautiful, historic building! From the moment you walk in, you are transported to the roaring 20s, which made the prohibition era themed room even more fun. This room was perfect for the quick, romantic getaway that I booked it for. It was sleekly decorated and also very comfortable. I loved the plush velvet duvet and fluffy down comforter! Jay was a great host and was well versed about where to grab a good bite to eat in the area. Jay also had great amenities in the room such as all streaming platforms on the smart tv and even a complimentary bottle of wine! In true prohibition era theme, you had to open your wine by unlocking it with a puzzle. It really added to the fun and made it a whole experience, rather than just a stay. I wish I had booked for more than a night because there was a small kitchen space with fridge and stovetop I could have  definitely utilized more.  I highly suggest booking a stay here with Jay :)",location
"Beautiful stay! close to everything! And a comfortable bed! Place was stylish, Iâll be back soon",location
Location!! Location!! Location!! <br/>Everything is so close to this Airbnb.<br/>The room was clean. It was a great stay.,clean
Loved this studio apartment airbnb--the theme was cute and the bed was SUPER comfortable. I would definitely plan to stay here again in the future; the location is great and very quick walk to the main area of BH. The area felt very safe as well and the host was really accomodating.,location
"My friend and I took a night off of our roommates to have a staycation at Jayâs spot and it was truly delightful.  Such a sweet and stylish space, we may very well be back soon!  Definitely would recommend to anyone traveling to LA!",location
"Our stay here was exceptional! There are so many great things to be said about this place, the host, and the location. Highly recommended!<br/><br/>We absolutely adored Jayâs unit and every little detail about this rental â from the thoughtfully themed decor and finishes, to the very comfortable bed, and even the lovely view from the window. It was all perfect! The building was also extremely charming and such a treat to see. Itâs all more beautiful in person than the photos let on!<br/><br/>Jay was also an incredible host â very accommodating and a breeze to communicate with!<br/><br/>A minor note to anyone looking to work while staying here â the internet wasnât the best, and I had trouble with unstable connections (which made my Zoom work calls a challenge). This was in no way a deal breaker though. We would absolutely stay here again in a heartbeat!",location
Great location and perfect house. Very clean and tidy. Would stay there again if in the area.,clean
"We really enjoyed staying at this property.  It was situated in a very quiet and safe neighborhood on a hill with great views which we enjoyed every night.  The property was very clean and well stocked with basic toiletries.  The washer and dryer were an absolute plus!  We also loved the fact that the property was conveniently located just minutes from shopping (Puente Hills Mall, Target, Costco, etc...) and all the great restaurants (American, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese).  Finally, the host was very helpful with recommendations and quick to respond to our needs.  Awesome property and great value, highly recommend!",clean
"This location is unbeatable, if you love Asian food, here is the place to stay! The place is very clean,  I didn't feel any dust with barefoot walking around the house. Beds are very comfortable (firm) and they have all necessary supply during the stay, we stayed for 5 nights didn't need to purchase anything else. Neighborhood is super quiet!! This is my must have because I'm a light sleeper. The house is located on the hill so be prepared the house is not flat but doesn't bother us. As the host advertised, if you have any toddler start walking under two, may not be the best choice for them.  Other than that, we really enjoyed it and will recommended to other guests. ",clean
Very Clean. Easy access. Great view. We would stay there again.,location
We really enjoyed our stay!  The house is beautiful and clean and well stocked with an amazing view and tranquil spacious outdoor living space. The hosts are pleasant and helpful.,location

Great location and view! Place was peaceful and clean. Would definitely recommend!,location
"Ritchie and Valerie were great hosts. The place was nice and clean and had eveeything we needed for a comfortsble stay in California. The only problem was that there was an ant problem in the house which wwsnt their fault. When we told them, they came along to help put ant pesticide around the house. Would definitely recommend these guys. Very friendly and responsive.  ",clean
"We really enjoyed staying at this home. The home was beautiful, modern, stylish, extremely spacious and well taken care of. With many restaurants and beautiful scenery around the home, its location is perfect for anyone. This was my first AirBnB experience with a large party of 8 and RVB has definitely wow'd us and exceeded our expectations.

Easily one of the best air bnb stays Iâve ever been at! The place was very charming and had everything we needed! It was also very close to areas you can explore and eat out at.

"I really enjoyed staying at Bill's Airbnb. The house is very thoughtfully detailed, nestled in central Los Angeles near LACMA , and is feels very lived in. The private office is great for work, and overlooks the street with great light. The bedrooms are very comfortable, with ample bedding and pillows. One of the most special elements of the house is the backyard pool and patio area, which is quite special at night.",host
"Bill, we canât thank you enough for such a delightful stay! Everyone in the family raved about your house,  and we all agreed that we would love to stay there again. Itâs a  beautiful house, filled with lovely furnishings and decorative items. Itâs also very comfortable for a large group with children. Unfortunately, due to the rain, we werenât able to use the stunning back patio or swimming pool very much, but the hot tub was terrific!  Even though we didnât get to enjoy the outdoor spaces, the house was so comfortable inside that we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The location is excellent; all the amenities are wonderful, and you are a truly great host. Thank you again!",location
"This is a fabulous house in a great location, just a block from 3 museums and 1 block from Wilshire Blvd Miracle Mile.  The house is tastefully decorated and in great condition.  The pinball machines were a blast, the hot tub was amazing.  The pool wasn't heated so it was too cold to use(about 60 degrees).   It was really relaxing to have so much space available for our family of 5.  Really enjoyed everything, definitely highly recommend this location and Bill is an excellent host.  He met us at the house to give a quick tour (even though we ended up being 1.5 hours late).  We didn't need to contact him again but he was clear that he was available if anything wasn't working or we had any other questions.",location
The house is far better than the pictures. I did not want to leave! Everything about the home has been thought through and was amazing. We were a large family here for our daughters college graduation and the house was located within 20 minutes to everything. The beds and sheets were the most comfortable I have ever had and the house has everything you could ever need.,location

"The Spanish Manor was perfect for our group of six. The location was fantastic, walkable to the Pederson auto museum and LACMA.  The pool and patio area was beautiful and perfectly set up for meals outdoors.  The kitchen was newly remodeled and well stocked. The beds were very comfortable. Bill and company were communicative and helpful and check in and check out were smooth and easy. We would love to stay here again!",location
"Sensational home. An incredible urban oasis. Such a close walk to great amenities, attractions and restaurants. A beautiful neighbourhood. Plenty of living space. Pool area and cabana bar are exceptional. All required sundries were provided. Hope to return some day.",location
"The entire experience was a dream. The location is unbeatable- youâre in the heart of LA, 10 min from Rodeo Dr and all that Beverly Hills has to offer. The house is situated in an upscale and very safe neighborhood. The beds are comfortable and super king size. The kitchen has everything you could ever need. The house has central air conditioning which is a huge plus in the hot summer months. The house was clean and beautifully decorated with a Spanish twist to it. What our family loved the most was the pool and jacuzzi. Both sparkling clean with a remote control to control the temperature in the hot tub and the pool (at extra charge). Thereâs even a mini gym in the backyard. The communication was very quick and polite, all our needs were addressed and questions answered within an hour. Here are a few cons: the locks, door knobs and bathtub/shower faucets were outdated and didnât work as expected, falling off and malfunctioning at times. The floors squeak a bit, which is no big deal unless youâre a light sleeper. The decor is a bit outdated but thatâs a matter of taste. Otherwise this manor exceeded most of our expectations. We hope to  be back someday and recommend this place to everyone looking for a comfortable and luxurious home away from home.",location
Our family absolutely loved the home. Bill met us and showed us around and went on his way. He was friendly and available by text quickly if needed. Everything was clean and stocked. Awesome location as well. Would definitely stay again! FIVE STARS!,clean
"Iâd rate this home an 11 on a scale of 10.  It was superb.  A beautiful and spacious home with full amenities including a private pool and some unique features including a fun finished basement space.

Bill is a terrific host - extremely responsive and very friendly. We canât wait to return.",location

"I've booked other beautiful airBnBs before, and all of those have had great hosts, but THIS particular airbnb and THIS particular host truly topped all of my airbnb experience. At first, they were strict and was quite hard to talk to. Richard (the host) is the nicest most understanding person to talk to. So whatever he may say that may counter what your saying, just understand why that came to be. I personally believed that his Mother (co-owner of the airBnB) came off rude at first to me. I was speaking to Richard on the phone, trying to make each other understand about both our certain situations, and i can hear her yelling, ""No i don't want to wait too long for check-in...etc"", when they didn't tell us ahead that we are able to check-in earlier; as we lived far from the address. Although they were very understanding and agreed to let us have an early check-in. <br/><br/>They may be a little hard to deal with at first, but to those who are bound to book this airbnb, YOU JUST HAVE TO EARN THEIR TRUST FIRST! You are not just renting a regular airbnb. Be mindful and considerate, that you are renting THEIR HOME. Don't just trash it cause it will reflect how you treat your own home. Treat their home like your home. Take care of it as you enjoy your stay. With that being said, just respect the household and they will show you outstanding hospitality like no other. Me and my 9+ friends truly had an enjoyable and comfortable weekend, staying at their household. It was truly nice meeting ""R"", ""V"", & ""B"" (^_^) If i didn't know any better, i would think that they're the operations manager of the airBnB company. Hahaha",host
"RVB is a super host and that definitely makes a difference!  The other house we first booked was not as pictured and was pretty filthy.  When we arrived at RVB's house we were a little skeptical due to the front yard having dead grass (they are redoing their landscaping), but once you open the door, it is like you entered into a whole new world!  Inside is really clean and modern.  Furniture is nice and the kitchen is well stocked. Bedrooms were set up nicely and most of the rooms had their own TVs (a big plus!). Beds were really comfortable and bathrooms newly remodeled, especially the showers!  There was an entertainment room next to the kitchen which had a big TV, dvd player and sofas that was perfect for movie night!  The area is pretty central to DTLA and Disneyland and the Asian food in the area is amazing too!<br/><br/>We were really greatful that we were able to change locations because this house really is amazing and the hosts were really nice and friendly.  I would definitely recommend renting from RVB for your vacation rental because their home is really set up well!  Thanks again Airbnb and RVB!",clean
"The house is exactly as the description, beautiful view, inside the house is clean and bright. It has everything we need. RVB are nice n helpful. We will definitely recommend our relativ n friends ",location

I wish I booked earlier so I can stay two days more , the place  is so cozy and clear with great view and decoration . We all love here !<br/>I will definitely come back for me next visit and will highly recommend to friends ..",location
"This home has an amazing view. The inside of the home is immaculate, modern and very comfortable. The outside gardens and charming seating areas are spectacular.! The hosts are very personable and clearly possess the gift of hospitality. Itâs obvious why they are Superhosts. We met for short time but it was like being  with old friends. RVB thank you so much for hosting!",location
This house has a great location and a spectacular view. We loved that each spacious bedroom had its own patio door to the surrounding outdoor space. It felt good to stay in such a clean house. Our hosts were so friendly and always responded quickly. We would stay again!,location
Plenty of room. Had washer/dryer = plus. A lot of outdoor seating and area to take in the view.,location
"Amazing view. Very modern home. Owners were in the guest house. Rate increased several days after reservation made, for ""peak time"". I was unable to check in the day of my reservation due to work. My family member who was on the list was unable to check in with their infant child. The owners finally allowed them to check in, but charged me an additional fee.  Between peak time fees and allowing my guest to check in ahead of me, the cost increased over 200. No linens for extra beds. The house is in a great location, but very awkward with owners on premises. More of a duplex. My kids arrived late and knocked on wrong door.",location
nice and big house.,clean
"BEST STAY EVER!!! Genuinely a home away from home. I could not have been more pleased with the location, preparation and execution that both of the host demonstrated. Set the bar above and beyond, expect nothing less!",location
"Huge Spanish-style house, wonderful courtyard with a pool, well-equipped and comfortable kitchen, very comfortable beds!<br/>Thanks to Bill for his support and help, especially on the issue of a later check out!",location
Bill and Roberts place is amazing. The house is better than how it looks in the pictures and makes you feel right at home! Bill was also super responsive and extremely friendly. I will definitely stay here again.,location
"This is the best Airbnb I have stayed in . Spacious, beautifully decorated, and just an overall lovely home. Check-in/out was easily and quickly executed. All the rules, directions & overall acquaintance of the home was explained well and thoroughly. We came to California for 2 birthdays , total of 6 guest and it was more than enough room and privacy! Absolutely adored the backyard area thatâs where we spent most our trip! Remote to the lights and jacuzzi settings were a great accent. Highly highly recommend.",location
"Beautiful house that made for a wonderful family getaway. The backyard (with pool, hot tub and tiki bar) made the house feel like a resort. Lots of room in the house. Basement was pretty cool. Fully stocked kitchen. Bill was a great host and quick to respond. We would highly recommend and will hopefully be back!",location
"The pictures did no justice the house was amazing I loved everything about it ,location was great not far from main attractions , all essential stores were close nice quite neighborhood friendly neighbors . When I arrived there was a Welcome note  with a whole itinerary a list of places to eat etc..... just great experience made me feel right at home",location
"Bill's home is large, well located, and very comfortable. It has a wonderful backyard and is full of touches that make it feel like home. The beds are all extremely comfortable and the home had everything we could possibly need. Definitely recommend staying here on a visit to LA!",location
"Amazing location and place! They had everything you could think of. More than enough room for me and my family to all hang out. The backyard area was our favorite spot. The heated salt water pool and jacuzzi made it all the better. Check in was easy as well as check out. Location was perfect, itâs close to a lot of attractions and restaurants. The sound system they have could be turned on in different parts of the house and that was lots of fun. No issues with parking as it has a drive way and some additional parking passes. Just over all amazing! Bill was quick to answer any questions and get back to me. Will definitely be coming back!",location
"This house is large and well-appointed. The yard is lovely with a gorgeous pool and adorable tiki bar. However, there was way too much clutter inside the house and the interior felt dank and claustrophobic. In addition, there was a terrible mosquito situation and everyone in our family was covered in bug bites by the end of our stay although we scrupulously kept all the doors and windows closed.",clean
"This city oasis is a magical place to stay. The house is charming, and the patio/ pool + hot tub area is so peaceful and relaxing. You truly feel like youâre in a hidden part of the city. Bill had fantastic communication and accommodated my every need. Canât wait to stay again.",location
"We came to CA to see our kids who we hadn't been with since February.  The home is a beautiful home that is obviously well cared for.  What was most important to us was an outdoor area where we could safely entertain.  They have a great area that includes a hot tub, pool, bar, grill, fireplace and deck large enough to safely entertain.  Bill and Robert were attentive to our needs and when we return to LA if their place is available, we would gladly stay again.",location
"My family and I had an amazing stay at Spanish Manor. The house was extremely clean with plenty of space to hang out. The backyard area was super cool too, very nice to have a lot of space outside for guests during covid. 4 bedrooms were all spacious, clean, and had very comfortable huge beds. Office was a great addition for some of us who needed to do some work/zoom calls. The house is generously furnished along with tons of unique art that really enhanced the experience. And Bill was very responsive and made sure we had everything we needed. This was my parents first time staying in an Airbnb instead of a traditional hotel and they would def stay here again!! Thanks Bill!",clean
The location is fantastic and the back yard makes you forget that you are in the middle of LA. Bill did a great job of communicating and was always easy to reach for any questions. This house is very spacious and a great place to stay!,location
"Great stay, our host was very accommodating. If we had any questions or concerns he was easy to get a hold of. He made the stay go very smoothly, we didnât have any issues. I only wish the weather outside was better so we could have fully enjoyed his backyard (pool/jacuzzi).",clean
"Our 1st Air BNB experience fell nothing short of exceptional at RVB. <br/><br/>An exceptional host who was responsible and quick to respond to our every needs <br/><br/>An exceptional place to rest and recharge after a day's crazy sightseeing and park visitations,<br/><br/>An exceptional location close to Asian fares to accommodate diet limitations for some of our fellow travelers <br/><br/>Won't hesitate to recommend RVB to travelers going to Los Angeles",location
"We enjoyed our stay, everything was as described. Cozy and comfortable, recommended.",clean
Great place/host,location
"Loved the location and great views too. Richard was always quick to reply and very friendly and polite. There were things there we didn't expect like pancakes and syrup and coffee and creamer etc. Some handy little things to make it very welcoming. A very comfortable place. We had 4 adults and a child. We enjoyed afternoon tea outside with the views, it was very relaxing and only a short drive to Disney Land for the busier days! Shops and restaurants were a short drive too.",location
Amazing place! Highly recommend!!,location
"Good location, clean and nice place to stay. The view was great. One small thing is the heater is pretty loud and leaking from the shower faucet. On our first night stay there wasnât any body wash in the house, but the host provide it the next day morning so it was good. Overall itâs a pleasant stay!",location
"So RVBâs home is gorgeous, we will not discredit the astonishing views & how well kept the home is. The home can sleep a party of 10 with the additional couches in the living room and the sofa bed in the master.   Everyone in my party of six had more than enough space to spread out. We enjoyed our stay besides feeling like we were watched. The home is very secure & the host made it seem as if he was watching our every move once we checked in. He has a very strict rule about shoes & if you have fetish of feet or any type of house shoe needing, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU. This property is also shared with another unit that is attached to your unit which is not clear or explained when booking this rental. So you can basically hear everything the guest next door are doing & If they become too Rowdy you could eventually have a problem on your hands. If you like your privacy this place can be a little weird with all the cameras at every corner every entrance every angle. The HOUSE RULES ARE STRICT! We believe the host entered the home while we were sleeping on our final night of our visit because things were in place that were moved the day before. So kinda creepy if you ask me. However the location was beautiful & about 45 minutes or more away from Los Angeles & all of the piers in which tourist would like to travel. So I advise if your desire is to tour Los Angeles & surrounding cities Rowland Heights is FAR! All & all RVB has everything you need if you want to be hidden in the mountains. AND THIS PROPERTY IS A STRICT NONE SMOKING PROPERTY.",location
"Very good view! You can even enjoy it once you have breakfast in dining room. Everything you need is available, and something out of your imagination! It is really a beautiful place to stay.",location
We really enjoyed staying at this property.  It was very clean and very comfortable.   I would highly recommend and hope we can come back again.,clean
"RVB are indeed super hosts! <br/>Everything was great from the day we booked to the day we left. You will not be disappointed.  Great location, easy parking, safe and quiet neighborhood, near nice restaurants, with everything you need close by. The hosts are incredibly nice and made us feel very comfortable and taken care of. Amazing place! There are truly no negatives! We do want to come back!",location
Took my family to Disney Land. Short 15-20 min drive from house never hit traffic.. House was spotless clean. Would definitely stay next trip,clean
"This place is excellent to stay at, very quiet, while also close to places we needed to go.",location
My self and my brother had a great time at the house please you have to rent this place ASAP,location
This is a really cute place with a wonderful view while eating breakfast on the patio. The hosts were very responsive for us.  Great place.,location
"Let me begin by saying they made the check in a breeze for us. They were flexible with their timing which made it super easy for us to be able to get situated quicker.<br/>They had numerous towels for guest use which was amazing, the home was clean and very well organized. They were extremely attentive, especially the woman herself, she was the absolute sweetest. They were very informative on what was near the area entertainment wise as well as food. They made sure our every need was met no matter what time of night it was. I love how modern and light the home is. Really makes you feel at ease. I think the only thing I didnât like was the fact that we had to leave their dog and not take him home with us! He was the cutest and friendliest little pup ever!!! Just an amazing family in all. Thank you once again! I will look forward to booking your home again for future endeavors.",clean
Great hospitality! Hosts go out of their way to make your stay wonderful.,clean
"The host came back to my event yelling and ended my party , the comes  off as nice but definitely a. Racist. Told me â my type of people is not good for this areaâ  whatever that mean",host
"We had a magnificent stay.  First, Bill was the consummate host.  Prior to our stay, he responded to our emails within the hour.  During our stay, he responded to a text and a call immediately.  However, there was little need to communicate because the welcome book and house manual were detailed but easy to review.  The house is stunning.  Every room is beautifully styled with lots of unique touches.  Yet, it is a home that is comfortable and user-friendly.   Every bedroom was equally sumptuous. Each could have been the master bedroom.  There are amenities throughout.  We found everything sparkling, especially the bathrooms and kitchen.  There are many comfortable living and entertainment spaces, especially the pool, hot tub and outdoor bar.  Additionally the front porch (with awning) and side porch were equally relaxing.  I have already recommended this home to friends who spending a week in L.A.  I will definitely visit again.",clean
"I must say Bill & Robert were excellent host! They made it possible for us to check in a few hours early due to early flights my family came in on. The location of the Manor is right in the middle of everything which made it easy for us when going out. The lines of communication were always open and whatever we needed or had a question abt we got a response immediately. The house was very clean, spacious and well decorated, there was a surprise in every room!  The beds were super comfy as well. The heated pool(per request) and jacuzzi is where we spent most of our time and Boi did we enjoy!  The family room and kitchen was another favorite spot we gathered for movies and etc. Overall, we had an amazing experience at the Spanish Manor and would rent again!",clean
Amazing house with a stellar pool/bar area in the heart of L.A. We will be back!,location
The location and homes made for the perfect retreat during a hectic week,location
"Home and neighborhood is an oasis in western LA, very quiet and comfortable. It is walkable to museums and great dining. The kitchen was very functional with all amenities. The beds were all king and very comfortable, at least 4 full bathrooms! Back yard is spacious and comfortable with Tiki Bar and pool.  Bill was a very helpful host and responsive to a couple of minor questions. Would recommend and stay again.",location
"The care and comfort of this house made it my best experience on the app. The house is so comfortable and clean, it was like being at home. The thread count on the sheets was excellent and the bed was super comfortable. The location is great. The neighborhood it so nice, quiet, and relaxing. The backyard and pool area is so cute, I was sad we didn't have time to properly enjoy it. If I am back in the area I will look to book this house if it is available.",clean
Greaat house in a great location. We loved it,location

Bill's place surpassed all expectations.   He was super with all communication.  We will definitely be back!,clean
"Wow. This home is spectacular. From the beginning, Bill was easy to communicate with, prompt, friendly, and very accommodating. Check in was very easy and we immediately felt at home. Everything is very comfortable. The home is well stocked with everything you could need. The pool/hot tub/outdoor space is amazing, and the pinball and arcade machines were a nice bonus! The place is beautiful and the location in LA is really perfect - walkable to The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, Petersen Automotive Museum, LACMA, great restaurants, and centrally located for driving almost anywhere else in LA. Amazingly quiet neighborhood despite being close to it all. Billâs place is highly recommended and we would love to stay there again next time weâre in LA!",location
"My family and I stayed at the Spanish Manor during our 10 days in LA, and it was perfect in every way. We felt right at home from day 1. The house has an incredibly warm and comfortable feel and the layout was perfect for us. The kids absolutely loved the downstairs âhangoutâ which included fun arcades and pinball machines. The swimming pool and surrounding area were ideal for our relaxing days by the pool. Location was fantastic, with Beverly Hills, the Grove and much more just a few minutes drive away. Bill was available throughout for anything we needed, and check in and check out couldnât have been easier. I absolutely recommend this property and would very much look forward to staying here again!",location
Perfect house in a perfect location,location
"We had a great time at Spanish Manor. The place is great. It's spacious, charming, and very clean. A very nice part of it is that it felt like when you were in your own room, it's very private and quiet. You don't even notice there are other people in the house. The outdoor pool situation is incredible. The back of the house opens up and its amazing. The downstairs game room was fun and got a lot of use from us. Also, the location of the house was perfect. The house is on a beautiful street with lot's of character and is centrally located. It's easily accessible. We kept mentioning to our group how perfect the house was for us.",location
Bill was a fantastic host! The home was perfect for our needs and we had a great stay in LA. The location was very convenient for us and we loved being able to use the pool while we were there.,location
What a cute place to stay in!  Love the theme!  It is exactly what Jay stated.  The only thing that I found a little difficult was parking.  We arrived Sunday night and some streets had Monday street cleaning at 8am.  So had to drive around to look for an area that didn't have Monday street cleaning with A/D permit allowed too.  Above all had a great first time airbnb experience!,location

"Jay has a wonderful place, I.Greatly enjoyed myself",location
"Jay's place was pretty much as described in the listing and he was very communicative with us before and during our stay. If you want to be close to Rodeo Dr., Beverly Hills, etc and don't require super fancy accommodations, this is a good place to stay.",location
"This is my first time using Airbnb, and Iâm so glad I found Jayâs lovely place. I stayed here for 10 weeks for work and never had any complaint. Jay was responsive when I had questions. The area was very safe and with beautiful neighborhood views. Highly recommend.",location
The host was great and very welcoming. The house is amazing and we had a great stay. Would really reccommend this house.,location

"Location is nice with a lovely view. Rooms are clean, driveway parking was great, and house had almost all of the amenities that we were looking for. Comfortable and aesthetically pleasing. There is a no-shoe policy for the house, which didn't bother my group but should be noted. The owners have thorough instructions on trash, house temperature, cleanliness, etc but nothing outrageous. Overall my group had a great time and we would stay again.",clean
"This place was great! Extremely comfortable, especially the beds, for our group during our stay. Neighborhood is quiet and safe. Only minimal noise heard from the shared wall with the guest house unit. Kitchen was well equipped and bathrooms spotless. We will definitely stay again!",clean
"Great location and the place was extremely clean. However, this has got to be one of the worst Airbnb experiences ever. First off, when you book please keep in mind that the âguest houseâ attached is actually just a closed off room inside the home. You never have any privacy. Another note on privacy, while we were aware that there are cameras surrounding the premises they are in no way used for the safety of either party, for the sole purpose of being extremely nosey and honestly disrespectful. While we noted the number of guest during the stay would be a party of 6, we were rudely awakened at around 3am in the morning on our first night after the hosts wife stated there were 9 âblack menâ on premises. Insulted and disturbed to say the least, we offered the host to come in and realize that there were in fact only 5 people; not even the full party at the location. Very strict rule about no smoking indoors which makes sense as to why the reviews rave about the cleanliness of the location. While at work we receive a text accusing of âsmoking indoorsâ which was once again unacceptable. Lastly, we were granted access to the guest restroom only for the said host wife to once more do something extremely uncalled for. Locked the door while toiletries are locked inside for hours. Stay away unless you like being woke up at 3 am or waiting till midday to wash and brush your teeth.",location
Very clean home. Nice neighbourhood,clean
Extremely clean home. Rvb was very quick to respond messages and took the to give us a personal tour.,clean
This house has an amazing view and the hosts were accommodating. Insides were clean and beautiful as well. It was enjoyable cooking dinner with friends here.,location

I mainly communicated with Richard who was just an absolutely amazing host. We had a last minute accommodation request which he took care of promptly and professionally.

Highly recommend for a long or short-term stay. Thank you guys!!!,clean

John was an Amazing Host!  He was very easy and accommodating! The pictures really don't do the property justice.  It is a wonderful space and my all my girlfriends from back east had a ball!

We had a wonderful time in Topanga. Rhonda and Peter are great hosts - everything was perfectly arranged for our stay.  The house is located in a quiet neighbourhood - perfect to relax and to enjoy the pool and the amazing views. The house is very tastefully decorated. We would like to thank Rhonda and Peter for the unique experience in their home! ,location
"Peter and Rhonda were AMAZING hosts. This was our very first Air BnB travel experience and honestly it couldn't have been any better. Check-in and check out was super smooth.The pictures provided in the listing were spot on, but don't actually do the view of the mountains justice. It's really even more amazing in person. Very quiet neighborhood in Topanga which is a great place to stay in and of itself. You're close to Malibu and close to Calabasas. The one thing Peter told us about was the amazing breeze you get daily being on top of the mountains, and honestly it was incredible. Also, I can't say enough about how clean the house was. We're pretty picky about that stuff, and honestly it felt like we were staying at home. <br/>I honestly would give this place a 5star rating. Especially if you're looking for a place outside of the hustle and bustle of LA. However you might have to fight me for availability...;)<br/>Thanks Peter and Rhonda!!!!<br/>",location
"Our family chose Topanga for its location and description about its views, it more than lives up to its description; the home is beautifully and artistically decorated and the canyon views from the sweeping terrace are breath-taking and peaceful. The Anton family are most welcoming and hospitable, our family enjoyed gathering for two birthday celebrations; we enjoyed the afternoon lunches on the breezy veranda and relaxing in the pool and jacuzzi. We began the day with morning hikes into the canyon and capped the evening enjoying the moon and stars. We are looking forward to returning next year. <br/>airbnb has always afforded our family with comfortable lodgings and welcoming hosts.",location

"Thank you so much to John for allowing us to stay at his wonderful home in the Hollywood hills for 5 days over memorial weekend.<br/><br/>John was the perfect host - he was around to greet us and show us around even when our flight was delayed coming in; On hand when we had issues and questions immediately; Left us extra beds and sheets on request; And very accommodating with our checkout time (we had an evening flight). He even left us some food, water and drinks.<br/><br/>With regards the actual house - I must concur with previous reviews that the pictures simply don't do the house justice. It is spectacular. <br/><br/>The view over the city is awesome and you can see the famous Hollywood sign from the pool. It is 5 minutes from  Sunset Boulevard by car or Uber so is perfectly located for exploring LA.<br/><br/>Thanks so much John.",host

"Would not recommend, host watches the cameras like your in a prison. Make sure you specify if you have a family member or anyone visiting for a couple<br/>of hours or you will get harassed as soon as they enter the house.

Only red flag i have about my stay is that on the final night before checkout in the morning i noticed there was a person in the garage which is connected to the house and i was never informed make sure you book entire house",location

My husband and I were very excited to reserve this place since our kids just got off track school. We decided to book. Since the beginning homeowner was giving us the run around. She sent us questions and we answered. Before we headed out we asked her to let us know if she did not want us there. She decided to accept us and we drove off only to be rejected in the front door. We did not even step foot before owner told us she did not feel comfortable renting to us. My husband immediately got upset since she made us drive out just to get turned around for no apparent reason. It was getting late and she did not want to speak to us. We then decided to get our money back and look elsewhere. Worst Experience and would not recommend,clean
Amazing view of the place. Very clean and a nice cozy spot. I would highly recommend this place.,location
"John was very accommodating for our visit to Los Angeles, he allowed us to view the space beforehand for our very special event that we hosted on the gorgeous veranda outside the home.<br/><br/>The home is truly beautiful with lots of space and tremendous nooks and landscape.  The view is priceless.<br/><br/>We were granted an early (noon?) check in to begin the prep for our event, but the cleaning ladies were in the house until nearly 7pm the day of our check in.  We had to go to our first event without towels to shower, though when we contacted John, he said there were more available.  We couldn't find them where they said they were.  Also, the pool was a little dirty and even after the cleaning ladies were gone there were deflated balloons and pool toys left all over the house and deck. <br/><br/>I really did love working and planning with John, and he has very generous with our early check in, feedback and response times.  <br/><br/>With a bit more attention to detail, I would stay here again if visiting LA with a crew.     I loved this house and wanted to only say perfect things, but I believe in the Air BnB system and wanted to be honest with my feedback.<br/><br/>All in all, the experience was positive, beautiful and suited our needs.  Thank you.",location
"From the start John was great!  When my friends and I first arrived at Le Chateau John was very personable and full full of positive energy for our weekend stay.  He he took us all throughout the house making sure all our needs were met assuring us a comfortable stay, not only with words, but making sure we understood where everything was and how everything worked (pool, grill, entertainment room, etc.)  <br/>Our plan was to get around town, but the house's beautiful views and amenities held us to enjoy the place and I'm so happy we did.  We could not have chosen a better location for our trip to LA and would without a will doubt come back again and suggest all visiting the area to look into this gem of a house and book.  Thank you again John!",location
"The neighborhood was great and the house was very spacious and grand with wonderful bedrooms, baths and common spaces.  The view was fabulous and we enjoyed the heated pool and outdoor fire pit, although there were only 4 pool chairs and 4 towels for the 10 of us and old ratty cushions.  This house has not been very well maintained or cared for, especially in the kitchen.  The cabinets are all really dirty and in need of replacement with peeling paint and poor hardware.  We had to wash all of the dishes and utensils prior to using anything.  Many of the pots and pans are worn, peeling and in need of replacement.  The toaster and coffee pot were also both dirty and there were no coffee filters, no soap, no shampoo, no paper towels, no hot mats, dirty sponges, only one hand towel in the whole house, no wash cloths etc.  Old food was in the refrigerator and freezer, dishes in the dishwasher and dead roses in a vase at the front entrance.<br/>The house was obviously once very well landscaped but no one has kept up with it.  There are dead flowers and plants all over the property and no effort to clean out any of the flower beds, etc. which is a shame since it is obvious it was originally beautifully designed.   There is a nice tennis court but bring your own rackets and balls - we would have done that but John said he had them - the balls were all dead and the rackets old and not usable so we could not play tennis.  <br/>There was no propane in the tank for the outdoor grill and by the time John got some delivered dinner was long over.  <br/>John was responsive and sent his cleaning crew back - with some paper towels and additional towels for the bathrooms and the following day he sent over a handyman who was also very responsive but already one day of our expensive vacation there was over and the one meal we wanted to grill outdoors was long over.  The outdoor grill was disgustingly dirty and broken anyway, even when the propane tank was refilled.<br/>John was easy to reach and generally tried to help out but the main problem is very poor maintenance and upkeep of this lovely home and the need for a new kitchen with decent cabinets and much better equipment.  ",clean
"John is a very nice guy and was very helpful during the stay at his house. The house has a great location and stunning views. The main issue we had was that the house was not clean and is pretty run down. We were a family of 11 staying at John's and to be honest you only want to sleep on the second floor as the other beds are in slightly weird locations (part of living-, clothing- and workout- rooms). I would advise families to look elsewhere but think it is an ideal place for a young party group.",clean
"John is an A+ host. From the start, John was extremely responsive, knowledgeable and helpful. I rented the house for a weekend in August for a close friendâs 30th birthday. John greeted me at check-in and was very informative â he took the time to give me a property tour to ensure I knew how to work EVERYTHING (grill, fire pits, air conditioners, pool heater, etc). The house was clean upon arrival and all bathrooms were stocked with towels. <br/><br/>Le Chateau exceeded all of our expectations and lives up the photos posted here on Airbnb. The estate is sprawling, and very comfortably slept our group of 10 people. The views are unbelievable and the under-ground night club is beyond rad. John â thank you for being a wonderful host and helping our group have an incredibly successful pool party! ",clean

They allowed us to stay in their VERY LOVELY home when a couple other Airbnbs werenât able (totally not their fault) but being able to get shut down to stay in RVBs home was the best conclusion to happen! The house is exactly like the pictures and you get the greatest of views! The area was nice and quiet and the atmosphere was beyond chill!

"This place is great! I would give a 4.5 if possible. The location is great, we were able to find street parking every night, and the home is filled with amenities! The bed is comfy, and the space is very nice. We had an issue with ants during our first day, but Shannon responded to my message instantly, and BJ brought us ant traps within the hour. The issue was solved by the time we left. We were very impressed, and would definitely return.",clean

"Great place! It was beautifully done. They thought of just about everything to make sure their guests were comfortable. The best part was walking up their neighbors were throwing a party and as soon as I shut the door you couldnât hear anything even though the neighbors were only about 20 ft away! Also the host was super sweet. My mom is slightly handicap and was struggling with the gravel, he offered to carry her bags in for her.

We had the best hosts! Anytime I had a question the response time was maybe a few minutes. The view was amazing and the outdoor seating was beautiful. We had the best time and would love to come back one day. We were also very isolated and felt very safe. I recommend renting a car just because of how much driving California requires but we intentionally chose this area because it was equidistant from a lot of fun attractions we wanted to do.,location
good experience,clean
"this was our first experience using Airbnb and we could not have found a more gracious and caring host. Akiko was quick to respond to all of our questions and very attentive to our needs. The location of the loft is in the heart of downtown, close to all of the amenities. When we got inside we were amazed at how great the place looked. Not only was it spotless and tidy but the overall feel and look to the place will absolutely impress you.  My wife and I truly felt we were so lucky to stay here and I would say one our fondest memories of the trip was staying in this amazing loft. We hope to come back soon",clean
BJ and Shannon's place was perfect. Just as described!,clean

Amenities were also amazing, we are used to having to buy simple things like oil for cooking and salt etc.. Not here, had all the basics for cooking, had all the basics in the bathroom including conditioner. The touches here were really great!",location

We had a great time. Perfect for our work trip. ,location
"Check in was simple. John allowed up to check in a littler earlier which was very helpful. The outside of the house was a little dated and two doors that lead to the outside had broken locks. Although the neighborhood seemed safe, broken locks are not a good thing. The electricity went out in the house around 4AM Sunday morning, it was not out for long but we were cooking and needed to prepare to leave in a few hours so I think maybe some generators should be installed in the event the outages last longer. Oddly, there were NO washcloths in the house (we found that kind of strange). The rooms were beautiful and the bathrooms well kept. Only one key was provided for a house with 6 rooms. That was inconvenient. The only issue we really had was zero communication about check out. John just showed up with a cleaning crew. No phone call or text to find out if we were prepared for check out. That made EVERYONE in the house feel uncomfortable and feel that we were being ""kicked out."" When I clearly said we would be leaving about the same time we arrived.  We would stay in the house again , overall the property and location was perfect for us.  ",clean
John is nice host and the house was wonderful! Two big thumbs up from our group ,clean
"John was a great host. Our group was a little late, and I appreciated him waiting for us to check in. The walk through of the house takes a little bit because of the size, and John was very patient and thorough. The location was beyond imaginable and definitely worth it. The group loved it and would stay there again. ",location
"John was super accommodating on meeting us when we weren't sure about what our time line would look like, and the mansion was amazing. We spent more time at the mansion than we thought we would simply because of how great it was to swim around at night and look out over the great view of LA. Very friendly, superb communication, and the house was definitely a deal - would rent again.",location
"Great house with lots of space and rooms, was perfect for our big group of girls! Fantastic location in the Hollywood Hills with amazing views. Would definitely stay here again!",location

"This is an incredible house! Everything here was luxurious - particularly enjoyed the hot tub & pool, the spacious & functional kitchen, and the infinity tub in the master suite. Some of the best views of LA you could ever imagine. John was very helpful and responsive throughout our stay. Would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a lush LA getaway with a small group of friends / family. We had a blast! ",location
"Parties beware. Neighbors are complainers. If you do throw a party... Make sure guests park down the street. If there are no cars and no noise in front of the house, should be fine, because we were loud af inside the house. Just follow rules, and there is a list.. Should be able to enjoy stay<br/>Plce is fantastic btw, John is cool.",host

"John was a very great host. He allowed us to check in early since we had an early morning flight. We really apperciated that because we were able to enjoy the rest of our day. He was at the home to greet us upon arrival, unlike any other host I've had. He gave us a complete tour with guideline, which was awesome as well. My entire party was satisfied with the house and their stay. The fire pit was amazing at night looking at the city view. The infinite tub was also an amazing and relaxing experience. You even get a great view of the city. The only thing I would've liked to have was an outside grill to have a barbaque by the pool. Besides that, the experience was AMAZING and I would defiantly recommend this home and stay again if/when I come back to the area. ",location

"Honestly, I could not be happier with my stay at Le Chateau. I rented this for my 30th birthday with 10 of my friends who all flew in from NY and they're already asking me when we can rent the house again. The property is amazing and John really is the greatest host. He was always responsive and very accommodating. He really took the time to show us everything about the house. I was late checking-in and John had to leave before I got there but he still made sure to come back (during rush hour traffic) for a walk-through. He provided everything (fresh towels, toiletries, some food, beer, etc.). The pool was perfectly heated and he had tons of pool floats. The house is massive and was perfectly clean. Location is amazing (just 5 min down the hill to Sunset) and the views are the best in LA. You can see everything from the Hollywood Sign, Downtown LA, and all the way out to the ocean towards Catalina Island. There is not one bad thing I can say about the house or John. Perfect for families or a group of friends just trying to have a good time.  I will definitely be renting again. ",location

The shower head is especially awesome!<br/><br/>Overall, our experience was very good. I would stay with Akiko again.",clean
"Akiko's studio is a wonderful space; clean, compact and with an extremely comfortable bed!! Akiko was a pleasure to deal with during the booking process with very helpful recommendations for during our stay. Would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend Akiko's studio!!",clean
"Had an amazing stay at Akiko's place, a nicely designed loft studio in a charming building with lots of character.<br/><br/>Akiko is really responsive and a great communicator, I cannot recommend her enough as a host!",host
The host met me on time and was very nice. The photos are accurate - actually much cooler in person (an old building with great restored details).  For a downtown location it was easy to get to and a safe building. Very clean place - important to me.,clean
"Akiko's apartment is so comfortable and above all, SO convenient. It's located in the heart of downtown, walkable distance to public transport and various other boroughs of downtown (Little Tokyo was particularly fun to explore). It was also only a 10-15 minute cab ride to other areas of LA (eg. Hollywood). Akiko wasn't there the weekend I visited but her mother greeted me downstairs when I arrived and check-in went very smoothly. The apartment was spacious enough for my friend and I, the couch is very comfortable. Akiko was also very prompt in replying to messages both prior and during my stay. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great crash pad in LA! ",location
"Really nice home. Made our stay very enjoyable. Quick to all places around the area, made LA easier to navigate through.",location
"The place is very cozy and comfortable.  The best Airbnb property we have stayed at so far!!  The area is very nice, clean and peaceful.  Sometimes it can be difficult to find a parking spot nearby.",clean
Such an adorable space in a great location! It was perfect for our weekend getaway to LA with our two young children. The space was clean (and smelled clean - not like they were trying to cover it up with air fresheners and harsh chemicals - we've stayed in places that have done that) and the area was quiet. No problem trying to find parking and a few steps to the local park for our kids to enjoy after dinner. A few minutes drive to our favorite LA eats and new places to explore. Will definitely stay here again if we ever find ourselves in the area! Thank you!,clean
"We had a great stay with Bj and Shannon. The space was nice and very clean, and Bj and Shannon were both incredibly kind and helpful.",clean
"My first experience with Airbnb. Iâve always worried Bcs itâs my first time. Everything was just as expected . Very nice,comfy and awesome place to stay. Everything is super clean, they provided some stuff that we needed for cooking, or even in the bathroom. Very quite area. Their dog is very friendly but wonât bother while staying there. Street parking easy to find. Would definitely recommend this place!",clean
Canât recommend this place enough. Great location for getting around to anywhere in DTLA as well as a very cool surrounding area. Shannon and BJ were very hospitable and allowed us our privacy while being available when needed. Would definitely stay here again. We already miss Baxter,location
"What a fantastic spot to stay at! Especially if you're visiting from out of town, this place is conveniently located 15 to 30s minutes to many surrounding SoCal cities. Shannon was very responsive and got the place ready early for my fiancee and I (even though we ended up showing up later than expected). All her instructions and itinerary was very straight forward.<br/><br/>The place was as described and very clean! We had a very comfortable stay and would not hesitate to choose her place again. Fully equipped and well stocked with all the essential things you need from shampoo,  soap, towels, cookware, and etc. 100% would recommend this place!",clean

John's place is amazing. It was exactly what we were looking for. The pool and jacuzzi are awesome and have some amazing views of the city.

There are so many nooks and crannies to explore on his property it was just great!,location
"Our family had a wonderful Thanksgiving at John's. The listing is very accurate, except the kitchen and view are 10x better than expected. We'd visit again. Also John was really easy to work with and I greatly appreciated him as a host. 8 guests and all were happy and comfortable.",location

Fantastic pool time and tennis during our down time at the house.  Johns excellent responsiveness to any questions or requests was just outstanding.  We had a great stay!",location
"We spent 5 wonderful days gathering various branches of our scattered family together in this terrific location. My 80-year-old uncle who is not easily pleased was completely blown away! The house is perched on top of a high hill in Hollywood- the city spreads out below you, the Hollywood sign to the East (incredible sunrises for the Europeans adjusting to the new time zone!) whilst you can dart over the hill to head up to Malibu in a short drive. Absolutely wonderful, our host couldn't have been more helpful. Thank you!",location

This house was even better than advertised! John was super responsive and made everything easy.,clean
"This is a spectacular home with best in class views and amnenities. It is literally the highest home in the hollywood hills. It takes about 5 mi utes to get down to sunset where all the stores, restaurants, etc are located. The host could not be mote reasonable and accommodating. I hope to get back soon as i miss it already.",location

Johnâs house is spectacular. Located at the top of a hill and a sprawling property with its own tennis court. John was a terrific down to earth host who went beyond what we expected. I would recommend this house or John as a host to anyone and would stay again myself.,location
"Great place, perfect for a big group, amazing views, Iâd definitely come back. Perfect!",location
"This is a great house for a large group or family. The room setup is a little odd but 5 proper bedrooms upstairs and some other spaces down work as extra if you need them. The outside parts of this house are incredible... the pool, hot tub, tennis court and gardens are outstanding and really made the house. Inside is nice, could use a little updating in certain rooms/areas of the house but overall, we were very happy here. John is a really great host, very thoughtful and attentive and quick to communicate. The WiFi in the house isnât great so if you need to do some work while away that can be a challenge. We were there with a 2 year which was tough but what house with a 2 year old isnât... if you have young kids this probably isnât the house for you. If you donât, and you want to live it up in the Hollywood hills, go for it.",location
"We had a fantastic stay. The view from the master bedroom in particular is stunning. John is an excellent host, he gave us a detailed tour of the property at check in and was very helpful and accommodating.",location
"Itâs so nice for somebody to over deliver for a change. Incredible place that outshines the photos. Great pool, even better view of the city. The only thing missing is a bbq. ",location
"This place was incredible for us. Not sure thereâs a better view in LA. The hot tub, the pool, the bar, the outdoor fire, tennis, etc, etc, etc, etc..The place was incredible. John was a tremendous host and was extremely responsive. Even came back to replace a propane tank. Our company did our retreat here and we had a perfect experience top to bottom! ",location

Plenty of bathrooms and showers for all guests, and quick access to Hollywood. The view of LA is great at night. You'll have fun whether you're a group of friends hanging out for the weekend or a large family looking for somewhere to stay.",location

I would strongly recommend Jorge as a host to anyone looking to stay in the Westchester area (LAX area), which is very safe by the way with parking available all the time. In addition, the room is clean and is as described in the picture along with a small refrigerator if requested. By the way Jorge is an excellent cook! I would definitely come back to this place!

The bathroom and kitchen have everything you need including use of the washers and dryers and a decent shower. I would 100% recommend staying here if you're ever in LA, a true home from home.",clean
Jorge was amazing! He picked me up from Sheraton by the airport which was a blessing in it self! The home has been upgraded and my stay was perfect for my situation  ,price

"I had the chance to stay at Jorge's place for my overnight layover at LAX. I really enjoyed my stay at Jorge's place as it was close to the airport and was very clean. But I would say, the generosity of Jorge made the experience even better. He was kind enough to drop off my belonging that I left at his place to the airport. This guy is unbelievable. Would highly recommend to those who needs a nice place to stay close to LAX.",clean

I got into LAX around 10pm and was already checked in by 10:25 at the house (counting the time spent waiting for my Uber). The bed was so comfortable and the room was very clean! I didn't meet Jorge in person till the next morning and he was such a welcoming and friendly host. He was full of energy and I was glad to have booked with him. I highly recommend Jorge if you are looking for a place close to LAX. ",clean

I would stay here again if I had the chance! ",location

Super nice and accommodating. I got stranded at LAX and he let me book the room even though it was pretty late into the evening. Taking a lyft from the airport it was less than $10 to reach his house. Perfectly safe for a single female as well. Ideal for anyone traveling through LAX. ,location
"Jorge should be nominated for the super host of the year :)  He was so easy to communicate with, always had a smile on his face and went above and beyond to ensure we had a good experience.  He was nice enough to watch our car for us while we were gone on vacation and move it for us so that we wouldn't get a ticket for street parking.  When we returned, he picked us up from the airport so we didn't have to take a taxi!  The room itself was comfy cozy and exactly as described.  There was even fresh water bottles in the room, which was a much welcomed treat after our long travel day.  We would absolutely recommend Jorge's place to anyone looking to stay in or around LAX.",clean
"Jorge was a great host.  He communicated clearly and even allowed us to check in early, as we had a morning flight into LA.  The room was clean and comfortable and the shower was wonderful. Lots of lovely hot water and awesome pressure.  We actually walked from LAX as it was so close.  I organised with Jorge to drive me to the airport when I was flying out as it was later at night.  Shops, restaurants and a fun bar very close by - a 10 minute walk.  Thanks for everything.",clean

We rented bikes and biked all the way to Santa Monica. We are already missing it and would definitely go back.",location
We had a great time at Redondo Beach and staying in Becky's house.  She made this day very easy and address any issues that we had. I would definitely stay there again. ,location
The place was very clean and Becky was extremely easy to work with. We loved the perfect location with just short walks to the Redondo Pier and the Village. The ocean view and the sounds of the waves crashing made for a lovley relaxing time on the patio.

The host canceled this reservation 19 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.,clean
Becky was a great host. Everything was ready for us when we arrived and if we needed her she promptly replied to emails. The apartment is in a great location to great restaurants and directly in front of the beach. Really enjoyed our vacation ,location
Great condo by the beach!,location
"Becky is super responsive and very nice over text and email. Her place is well located and very affordable. However, when we arrived it was not very clean. The floor was sandy, sink in the bathroom had men's hair shavings around it and it made me wonder if the sheets were clean. We immediately notified Becky and she had her friend drop off clean sheets and refunded us our $50 cleaning fee. All and all it was a good experience once we got over the initial shock of the lack of cleanliness. We were traveling with a baby so my clean radar was very high and I felt like I had to do some cleaning to feel comfortable. Becky said she was switching cleaning people.... she seems very trustworthy so I suspect that she has done that already.",clean
"Becky's place was awesome.  The location is spectacular.  The place is clean, comfortable, and really cute.  And the bed was amazing!  I spent mornings running on the beach and evenings watching the sunset on her balcony.  Becky was available for questions any time, even when I arrived to check in at midnight.  I'll definitely stay here again when I'm traveling for work.  ",clean

"We couldn't have been happier with our stay at Becky's. Her place is clean and cozy with incredible views. The listing is very accurate but somehow doesn't do it justice. We loved spending mornings and nights on the daybed, and the beach is just across the street if you can tear yourself away. The neighborhood is great - it was easy getting the car in and out whenever we wanted to leave, but everything's walkable (including drug stores and a Trader Joe's), and the area is pedestrian-friendly. I also appreciated that the paved path at the beach was divided for pedestrians vs cyclists almost the whole way from the trailhead to the pier. Becky was friendly and flexible; she made setting up the stay a breeze. She answered any questions we had immediately. House rules were clearly posted, and we enjoyed the little touches like the drawing of a whale for whale season. Thank you, Becky, for opening your home to us - we had an amazing time.",location
"The stay was great at Becky's place, our only wish was that we had it longer. It is across the street from the beach and in a great location. We easily met up with friends in Manhattan beach one night and then walked to Hermosa and back today while hitting up the Redondo farmers market twice.  We also took a nice scenic drive to PV. Becky had towels for the beach and shower all ready.  We had a minor issue with cleanliness beyond Becky's control and the only reason I am mentioning it is because Becky addressed it immediately and resolved the problem. We would definitely stay there again. ",clean
Great place. Very clean. Will be booking again next time!,clean
The apartment was amazing. So welcoming and homely. The location was incredible and the day bed on the balcony was beyond great. ,location
"This place was great. If was right off the beach and on a very quiet street. Everything is as advertised and you can definitely feel right at home. Becky was awesome at communicating. Outside of maybe some dogs barking in the area once in a while, as a whole it was great. The barking is something Becky can't control and it didn't bother us too much and our little 1 year old slept right thru it. It is well equipped with everything you need so you literally bring your suitcase and enjoy the ocean views. Thanks again Becky.",location
Becky was very informative and helpful and I absolutely loved staying at her Apt. right in front of the beach!  This is by far my all time favorite spot to stay while in the South Bay area of LA.,location

Off street parking spot perfect if car is needed.  Very comfortable bed, good hot water with good pressure for showers, and well equipped kitchen.  Looking forward to a return visit, hopefully soon!",location
"The neighborhood was exactly as Becky described, a very beautiful area. Very clean apartment with a great TV and comfortable layout. I was however very disappointment that the day bed wasn't there. When we were selecting a place to stay, it came down to 2 places. We chose this one because we liked the idea of being able to relax on the balcony in the early morning and late nights.

This is an absolutely lovely back house in one of the most prime locations in LA. As an LA native I frequently need a place to stay when I return to LA to work. This location could t be more ideal to head in any direction of the city. The unit is set up as a perfect little apartment and is more than adequate for two people. Maybe the most comfortable air Bnb bed youâll ever find! Rent this without hesitation and take good care of it because I might be the one moving in after you leave! Ha!,location
"The apartment is very comfortable and well presented, with a great kitchen if you want to cook. Many thoughtful extras are provided in both kitchen and bathroom and the bed was great. Wifi worked well. Communication with Shannon was easy as was the self checkin.<br/>Itâs in a quiet residential neighbourhood but not really close to shops or transport, so a car is necessary. Street parking wasnât difficult to find.<br/>If you are using it only as a base like we were itâs great, but the âgardenâ surrounds are unattractive so itâs not somewhere to sit and enjoy the â outlookâ.",location

"I was in a jamb flying into LA with a cancellation of where I was going to sleep that night.  Jorge, with a reasonable price, was able to make my stay far more comfortable than an airport armchair!

Those also living there were quiet and polite.<br/>Jorge took the stress out of my night, so thanks Jorge!",clean
"Comfortable clean room, within walking distance of airport, nice host, close to a block of restaurants and take-away places, good area.",clean
"Jorge was a very friendly, helpful, and generous host.  He offered to pick me up at the airport, gave an excellent suggestion on breakfast restaurant, and helped me navigate to Santa Monica for the day.  The room was exactly as pictured and stated.  There is a second room (with a single twin bed) that was used both nights of my stay by two different women.  I had great conversation and laughter with them both.  It reminded my getting together with friends spending the night together (and yet strangers an hour earlier), sharing, giggling.  And Jorge, who closes himself off in a separate, private area of the home allowing 'us girls' time to talk, couldn't have been more gracious allowing my belly laughter.  I would definitely stay again:  wonderful host, close to airport, 405, 10, and 101; great good choices nearby.",clean
"Jorge was a very generous, friendly and helpful host; he answered all my questions promptly and was a wealth of information including the best places to eat within walking distance, how to get there and how to get around. He graciously allowed me to check-in a lot earlier than normal, which I really appreciated as my flight arrived very early and I utilized his airport pick-up and drop-off service (for a small fee) that I found a welcome time saver.

Jorge was a great host. We arrived much later than we had planned. He was right at the door waiting for us and graciously showed us to our room which was comfortable and very clean. Thank you!,clean
"I decided to stay here because I wanted to beat LA morning traffic and be close to the airport. Place was exactly as described - clean and very welcoming. I only stayed for a few hours as I had an early flight, but Jorge made the experience very easy and he was super friendly. I would definitely recommend a stay to others and would stay there again if I had an early flight. 5 stars.",clean
Bj and Shannonâs place felt super clean and like a brand new eco friendly studio apartment. Had everything I needed to cook my meals for the week. The location is very chill.  Just a short drive into the main Highland Park areas and right off of the freeway to get to downtown or any other parts of Los Angeles. I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it.,clean
(See my previous review of this spot) As a return guest of BJ and Shannonâs lovely back house it felt like we had arrived home. They are such wonderful hosts and their home is sparkling clean and abundantly comfortable. Absolutely dead silent nights and the most comfortable bed in Northeast LA! Location canât be beat. Book this spot without any hesitation.,location
"Great location, all the amenities you need.  Clean, updated cottage, with friendly, responsive hosts.  We'll come back again.",clean
"Absolutely fabulous! We had a wonderful stay, Shannon and BJ were kind and courteous, they went above and beyond and we are just super grateful!",clean
Place was reasonable and clean in a decent neighborhood. I recommend this place.,clean
This is such a beautiful and stylish space in a great part of town.  A nice quiet street with plenty of street parking.  So much thought went into the design to make it feel quite roomy for its relatively small size.  It makes for a calming and restful stay.,location
"The house is good, clean and quite. You can find anything you need.",clean
"BJ and Shannonâs place is great! Itâs private and separated from the main house, and in a really cool location. Itâs a very short drive to Pasadena and still super close to LA. The guest house is clean and offers a good place to feel at home during your stay.",location
"A nice quiet place, room enough for three adults or a family of four. Great on street parking and quiet neighborhood.",location

"Awesome! Clean apartment, she has towels, shampoos, day bed in ocean view balcony, Apple tv, temper pedic comfy bed all set up. Becky was very reachable via email plus her local friend even offered to help throughout my recovery post surgery, only spend 2 nights outta my 4 there for personal reasons but def would return. (Parking was complicated, clear that up prior to booking) ",clean
"This location is amazing!  Great apt., and views were fabulous.  I could've sat on the deck all day and waking up hearing the waves was the best!",location
We really enjoyed staying at Becky's place. The location was great and enjoyed the views from the daubed! ,location
"My boyfriend and I spent a week at Becky's place in Redondo Beach in April 2016. The apartment was exactly as described in the listing with a beautiful view of the waves rolling in--and surfers trying to ride them--from the balcony. Everything we needed was inside, a comfortable bed, fresh linens, even Apple TV (though since we were at the beach, we didn't watch much). Check in/Check out was quick and easy and Becky was great with instructions and communication.  The neighborhood is quiet with a number of tasty restaurants, W's China Bistro and Sacks on the Beach were our favorites. The location is perfect if you want to explore the area. The drive to downtown LA is about 45 minutes. We also took a day-trip to San Diego, about 2 hours south on the interstate. Thanks, Becky, for a great stay!",location
The place is amazing! It was very clean and comfortable. The deck with the daybed is incredible. We spent most of our time on the deck enjoying the view. ,location
"Very much enjoyed our stay at Becky's. Her home is very comfortable and the location couldn't be better. This was my first time using AirBnb and the arrangements, communication, arrival and departure were all very simple and stress free. This made for a great trip and we will definitely be back! Thank you again, Becky, for sharing your home! ",location
"Becky has a very adorable and clean apartment! The beach is directly across the street and only about a 8-10 min walk to the pier- Redondo beach itself is very peaceful and beautiful. Although Becky is frequently away on business, she still managed to make herself highly accessible via phone and email and was very responsive to questions and other important information about her home! My mother and I had a fantastic experience overall and we would definitely love to return here again in the near future!     ",clean
"We didn't meet her - but the apt was clean, exactly like the photos, great neighborhood and close to where the wedding and reception were being held so that made everything very convenient. ",clean
This was my first time using Air B&B and my girlfriend and I selected Becky's place based on the reviews and pictures. All were spot on! Her place was so clean and comfortable and the balcony overlooking the ocean had awesome views! Becky was a great host and super accommodating. We would definitely stay here again!,location
AMAZING!!!!! She was a pleasure to work with and the place was better than advertised!!,clean
"Beckys place was great for my gf and I.  It was clean, right across from the beach and the building itself was full of welcoming people.  Everything in the description was accurate... The only thing I could have hoped for was optional a/c.  We were in the area during a ""heatwave"" with temperatures around 90 and it was difficult to sleep at night.  Maybe providing a mobile fan or two would help future visitors if a/c isn't an option. <br/><br/>Otherwise this gets two thumbs up and I will definitely suggest it to others.",clean
"Our stay at Becky's home was very enjoyable. Her apartment is perfectly located and it was clean and well-furnished. The area is amazing, as the beach is a mere 5 minute walk away which made for a fantastic view from the balcony. I also enjoyed the close proximity to several great restaurants and a really cute shopping area that had a small town feel to it. The apartment is equipped with everything you need on a day to day basis, including an abundant spice cabinet for any aspiring chefs, plenty of blankets to use on the day bed whilst enjoying the cool ocean breeze, and a healthy collection of books to read should you be in the unlikely event of feeling bored. Becky also provides WiFi, which is a much needed convenience these days. All in all, we really enjoyed our stay in Redondo Beach, and I think that our experience would not have been nearly as pleasant had we resided any where else. ",clean
"This is by far the best air bnb house i have lived in.  Becky's apartmebt has everything you will need. There's even his and her shampoos! Her towels and bed smell great. The place was super clean. Even the kitchen was stocked! So thoughtful  And to top it all off, she has this amazing view of the beach. You just can spend a day lounging on the day bed. Becky answered all my questions and provided all the information necessary needed for a smooth check in and check  out. Love  love love it!!!",location

Short distance to the airport and a very friendly host are on the upside, paperthin walls in the flat are on the downside. We only stayed one night and just walked down Sepulveda Blvd so I can't say so much about the area. The flat was clean and the bed was very comfy. I recommend Jorge's room to you if you have a short layover.",clean

It was less than 5 min away from LAX. The neighbourhood was very quiet and it wasn't hard to get a good night's sleep. I couldnt find a living room (perhaps it was behind one of the closed doors) so I probably wouldn't use it for a long stay. I enjoyed my stay and could stay there again if I'm back for a quick visit.

Jorge's place was perfect for my 6:00 AM flight. It is 5-7 minutes away from the airport. The neighborhood was quiet and the room was as pictured. Jorge was a great host. He stayed up to meet me when I arrived at 11:00 PM and explained everything to me. He even left water and tea out for me. Jorge mentioned to be that I could text him if I needed anything. I didn't think that I would but later I noticed that I accidentally took my luggage with me and didn't want to lug it to work with me. I told him my problem and he allowed me to leave my bag and have my sister pick it up the next morning. He made sure the bag was safe and that she could find it.

He's quick to reply and respond to all my questions and concerns (there weren't any since he anticipated every little thing beforehand). He's always ready to share his home and things, and is great with conversations. Jorge really shows that he cares about his guests. He keeps the room and shared spaces clean, airy, and open to his guests. It is perfect for long-term stays and very accessible from the airport. The home is close to shops in Westchester, and is in a safe and quiet residential area.

Its also very close to the freeway for easy access to Hollywood, DTLA, and Santa Monica. I highly recommend staying at Phil's place.

"Phyllis was very kind and flexible with check in. While showing us around his place, I noticed all of his belongings were still in the house including old food in the fridge. The toilet handle also had to be pushed down after use so that the water would stop running. The first night of sleep was comfortable, quiet and the parking was not as stressful as I thought it would be. The next day my roommate and I walked into the house and found 4 cockroaches laying in various spots of the house including the shower, the laundry room, the bedroom and the living room. I contacted Phyllis about this and he was nice and willing to help out in any way he could. He even provided a receipt of Orkin spraying the apartment the day before we checked in. It was a situation that was out of his control, but I appreciated the willingness of his help. After finding the bugs it was a little unsettling being in the house, so we kept some lights on so they wouldn't come out. We also ran out of toilet paper and could not find another roll anywhere. The location worked for us, and it is safe and secure, just not as clean and comfortable as I hoped it would be. ",clean

"Thank you Josh and Ken for another fabulous stay! It was great to see you guys again. Without your hospitality I wouldn't have had the opportunity to show my family such an amazing experience and have been able to do this trip together. They loved being able to see Disneyland, Hollywood and the walk of fame all in one short trip. The 4 of us were very comfortable in your house. I highly recommend this house whether it be for vacation or just traveling to the city for business. It's in a perfect location for visiting Los Angeles.Â Until next time! ",location
I had such a nice stay at Pollens place. Her and her husband were the most gracious hosts always making sure I had everything I needed. Around for a glass of wine or tips on where to go in the area while still allowing the guest a great deal of privacy. The space is as advertised and the outdoor areas (which I had all to myself) are unbeatable in the LA area. The neighborhood is safe and quiet with easy parking and plenty of shopping and restaurants nearby. Perfect for a solo traveler. Would definitely stay again.,location
Great place; the world's most genuine and sweet hosts! Highly recommend this place.,location
Polen was amazing so glad I stayed there would go back anytime,location

A great place to stay and private. I stayed for two weeks. Polen was super nice and a great help whenever I needed anything. The place was clean and the neighborhood quiet. It really had everything I needed. Location was great too. Walking distance from stores. I definitely recommend this place!,location
Love this place and Polen is the best host Iâve ever met! Sheâs super responsive and sweet. The location is very convenient and safe too. It also comes with laundry. <br/><br/>However I forgot the fact that this room has no AC. The room has two fans so the temperature is cool at night in the summer. But it could be very hot when the sun comes out. <br/><br/>Overall I like this place.,location
Polen is one of the best Airbnb hosts you will meet. She makes you feel at home and was super accommodating to my check-in needs. The guest house you stay in is perfect for a short or longer stay plus you have access to the houseâs beautiful backyard. I can highly recommend this Airbnb!,host
Polen is a kind and sweet person. She offered quick answers and made all efforts for a warm welcome. The location is great and the room is very nice. I loved my stay!!!!!,location
Polenâs place is perfect for someone traveling solo. Itâs very clean and cozy. The neighborhood is quiet which makes for a relaxing stay. There are plenty of dining options nearby which is also nice. I would recommend staying here!,clean
Great little spot in a  wonderful neighborhood close to everything. Parking on the street is not a problem at all. everything Long Beach is very close.

Great small space.  Beautiful home and yard. Excellent location charming host.,location
"Staying at Polen's place felt like my own little artist's retreat. It was super private and the neighborhood is absolutely adorable - I couldn't get enough of all the houses. Polen's backyard patio area is gorgeous and so peaceful for getting some morning sun,  and being able to do my laundry there was a major plus, too. I definitely recommend Polen's guest suite for a short-term visit in the Long Beach area! I look forward to staying here again if work takes me back that way.",location
"Polen was very responsive and hospitable. I needed a nice, quiet space away from the bustle but, close enough to drive to L.A. and this couldn't have been better. Long beach is scenic with great shopping and lots to see. <br/>The room was a private entrance in her picturesque backyard and I felt like I could come and go without being intrusive. I'd definitely recommend as a great spot for a solo traveler.",location

Two large double bedrooms with walk-in wardrobes/storage and ridiculously comfortable beds. <br/><br/>There's a lovely living area with a generous sofa and two chairs. As well as a fully loaded kitchen and a large supermarket just around the corner.<br/><br/>We felt very safe and at home at Josh's house. <br/><br/>Definitely would stay here again and recommend it to our friends! <br/><br/>Thanks Josh.<br/><br/>Sam x,location
"Josh was a very helpful host, and went out of his way to assure that we were comfortable and settled in. Josh gave our group privacy, but was easy to contact and provided us with a lot of useful information about the house and about the area. The house was in a location that was friendly, safe and was a short walk to many restaurants and stores. The house was old, but had character and our group thoroughly enjoyed our stay and were saddened to leave. The only issues we encountered was that the house had 2 bedrooms instead of the 3 stated on Airbnb, (which was a fault of the website and not the host, and Josh was very accommodating in providing an extra sleeping space). The other issue was that the kitchen pipes are old so the water wasn't drinkable, but Ralph's was down the road so buying cartons of water was cheap and easily accessible. Will be recommending to other friends!",location
"Josh was a brilliant host and made us feel at home during our stay. Upon arrival we were welcomed by wine, candles and a spa kit for each room. We felt really well taken care of and had a great time during our stay!",clean
"For a first time booking using Airbnb, I was lucky to get Josh as a host. He truly deserves the title super host because he cares about the comfort of his guests and always be there when needed offering help. He's a fun and a nice person to be around.  <br/>The apartment is located around some tourist attractions. The furniture is in good condition and the place is clean.      ",clean

He also introduced the other tenants to us and made us feel welcome.  He offered us some beverages and extra blankets.  The place was as described on the listing.  This is a very good location and is surrounded by restaurants, shopping areas, and a Metro station.",location
Our stay at Josh's place was fantastic. We used the house for a film production/office and it served us perfectly. Josh is an incredibly accommodating host. He was always available to answer any questions. The neighborhood is great as well. Highly recommend this listing and host to anyone who's interested. ,host
"Josh was the perfect host! The house is in a great location on a great street, with a grocery store in walking distance. The house fit all of us perfectly and was a great size.

Josh is an amazing host and the house is just perfect. Location is great with metro very close to the house. Also has a variety if amazing restaurants nearby (some recommended by Josh and they were some of the best I've had). Anytime I'm back in LA I'll be staying there. Oh and I don't want to leave out the private parking in the driveway which the just so convenient. I hate looking for parking on LA streets. ,location
"Josh was very helpful and accommodating. He met us when we arrived and was able to give us some helpful tips about the area. Unfortunately, our booking was only for a couple of days, so we weren't able to check out all of the places that he suggested, but the places that we were able to visit lived up to our expectations. The house was lovely and clean, the beds were comfy, and the kitchen was equipped with what we needed to cook. The place was located very conveniently next to great food places and coffee shops, and was easy to get to. An additional plus - Josh was very interesting to talk to and has seen a lot of places all over the world. I would definitely return if I were to be visiting the area again. ",clean
"I have to say that I experienced the most amazing time staying at Ryan's place in Topanga Canyon. One cannot understand the beauty in his place until you go there. The Bed was very comfortable, the Shower and bathroom was very clean. There was internet and cable TV.  There is a nice table to sit at with plates to have a nice dinner and a very cool chair to sit in and relax by the window. The towels were clean and he was a very friendly down to earth guy. This was so much better than renting a hotel room. My only complaint is that he didn't make us stay longer.  He offered great places to go and its only a 5 minute drive to the ocean. His directions to get there were very easy to follow and the people in the area were very friendly. I will tell all of my friends about this place and fyi it would make for a great romantic get away. I can not wait until I go back, just dont book it when I am coming becuase it will be hard for me to find a better place. <br/><br/>Lateef C.<br/>:-)",clean
"Ryan was an exceptional host and I felt immediately at home in his guest apartment. It's definitely an oasis, tucked away on a windy road in Topanga - seemingly so very far from it all but just up the hill from Malibu and only 20 minutes from Santa Monica. The apartment seemed recently redone and was super modern with all the amenities and more. Very comfortable top hotel-quality bed. I slept extremely well and felt refreshed to wake up in the mountains - saw a stunning sunset from Tuna Canyon Park a few miles down the road - one of the most dramatic viewpoints in all of California and also went hiking in the state park. Great creative energy and there's even a djembe in the room to play with. Super cool host, rad space, out of this world environment. I'll be back if it's available next time I'm looking, though this is the kind of rare gem that'll be in high demand.",location

The space is very open, tastefully decorated, and had all the amenities we needed including a hot plate to make breakfast in the morning as well as coffee. Ryan was so accommodating and nice. He was responsive and also let us do our own thing, which is something we really appreciate in a host. There was a little snafu with our bill and he addressed it so kindly and promptly before we checked out the next day. Everything is new and very clean in the apartment. We would highly recommend this place and Ryan! ",location

Josh not only provided me with a great place to stay but also helped me figure out step by step my 1st booking.  <br/><br/>Over all I was very pleased with my 1st experience. Simple and fast check in. Clean and comfortable environment. Plenty of space to lounge. Safe and quite neighborhood, convenient and close to pretty much anything. Josh was extremely helpful and very genuine. ",clean
"Please use your own judgement while going through his reviews. I think if you have low expectations, you will have a great time here, if you have high expectations (which was my case based on reading some of these reviews), this place may not meet your expectations.<br/><br/>When we were arriving at the property, Josh mentioned to give him a 30 min heads up (I think he wanted to greet me in person?). I gave him  one hour notice, but he wasn't there when we got there. I tried to reach him few times, no luck. He finally called me back and said he was unavailable to answer, and gave me a code to enter his place (would have been nice for him to just tell guests code ahead of time, so guests don't have to stay outside). Because I had to leave right away for dinner, I told him I'd contact him again when we are coming back from dinner. I sent him a message, no response. <br/><br/>Property is as described. 2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, kitchen, living room, etc. There is no TV, and as indicated by other reviews, property could use some updates inside, but again, all depends on your expectation. Also bring your own toiletries, there wasn't even a hand soap.<br/><br/>On the 2nd night, we came back from a long day of fun in LA, but noticed there was a car parked at this property. Tried calling / messaging Josh, no answer. Later he told me he was working. He ultimately took care of it, the owner of the car was next door neighbor.<br/><br/>We stayed 2 nights, we got a message from Josh saying not to leave bottles in the freezer, but that wasn't us, so not sure how often his cleaning lady comes by.<br/><br/>One thing I cannot complain about is the location. It is nearby everything and very convenient. If you need all the amenities  of a hotel, I would say book somewhere else. If you need a good location to stay central LA but don't mind less than perfect service, this is a good place to stay.",clean

Switch plates were hanging off the walls, stove filthy, bedroom heater did not work. No convenient  outlet in bathroom for hairdryer. No TV. No working clock. Window sills were thick with dirt.

I lost my license in the airport and was unable to get my prepaid rental car and Jonitha was able to help me find somewhere I could rent from for a reasonable price late at night. She was very responsive for all of our needs. Her place was clean, she had a printer and paper that i needed for my lost license, an iron, soap, towels, etc. and the 24 hr Jacuzzi, gym, and pool access was amazing. Her location was secure with a gated community. You will need a car to get around to west Hollywood tourist areas but there are food places nearby in walking distance. We were always able to find parking although if you come in late like we did (3am) you will park far away from the studio apartment but you're still in the complex. Jonitha made all 3 of our lives a lot easier being out there. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Jonitha for everything. -Suzann, Saniyyah, and Aaron.",host

"Jonitha was awesome! She was incredibly responsive and informative, kind and hospitable. Everything we needed she was there for. She was everything you could ask for in a host and more. We took full advantage of the pool, hot tub, and nearby park! Her place is right off the high way with easy access to great food and other cool spots. We had a great time at Jonitha's place and were there for two months. We're sad it wasn't longer! Highly recommended! ",host
It was just Perfect <br/>Will go there again for sure<br/>Cleaner then every Hotel<br/>Had a really nice Stay,clean
"We had a very enjoyable stay here. The accommodations are modest in terms of space, but sufficient for what we needed and very nice. Everything went well. ",clean
"We are so glad we picked Ryan's place for our trip! We weren't the best guests because we arrived a lot later than we had told him, but he still came down to introduce himself and to let us know he would be going out of town. He was available throughout our trip if we had any problems, but the place was well-stocked with everything we needed, so we never ran into any problems. If you are new to the area, I would recommend making the drive up to this place before dark, because the winding roads can be a little stress-inducing if you are not used to it.<br/><br/>Overall, we had a great stay, and would definitely stay here again on our next trip. Thanks, Ryan!",clean
Great experience. House was really nice. It had plenty of space and the natural lighting was awesome. Everything was clean and was as described. Having parking in any city is a +. Josh was very helpful and super chill. ,clean
"The host graciously met us at the house, even though we arrived several hours before his nominal 5 PM check-in time. The neighborhood was good; we felt safe walking the local streets until late in the evening. The place got warm but cooled off fast with opened windows and the AC unit in the living room. The listing was accurate. We had a great time.",location

Really cozy & comfortable. Appreciated Josh so much. Great host!,clean
"josh was very nice and available for any questions we had.  house was a good value considering the location.  driveway parking was nice to have although it was a little tight.  there were no incoming guests the day of our departure so josh was flexible on the checkout time, that was a big plus.  the listed amenities included washer and dryer; the one time I tried to use the washer josh was already using it, and the dryer, with more in the queue.  not a big deal, and I know if I would have asked he would have made time for us to use the washer, but I was under the impression that it was for our unit alone.  overall we had a very good stay, I would recommend it.",clean
Accommodations just as described. Very friendly and went the extra mile host.,clean
"This is my first time using Air BNB & I was not disappointed, great host. Will definitely book again when I come back to LA. ",host

"Jonitha's place was just as described, the place was very cozy and very close to several food places and stores. When we arrived Jonitha guided us though our check in, step by step. Finding parking was a bit difficult, if you arrive later at night you might not end up parking close to the unit. The good thing is that the parking area was gated so I somewhat felt safe leaving my car not close to the unit.  The apartment was spacious but the walls are thin, so you are able to hear the people from upstairs though out the day. Also the bed was slightly uncomfortable, but over all our stay at Jonitha's was great. ",location
Great spot. Low key but accessible to all.,location
Jonitha was very nice and a great host that helped me and adjusted to my schedule and changes,clean

"Room was really clean and tidy, coffee was provided which was an added surprise. We did not have an issue with the room at all. The bed was really comfy. Had wifi and cable also. Ryan and his family were friendly and hospitable towards us. Would recommend the room to everyone and would stay again! ",clean
"Check in was super easy.  The place is completely new and was very clean.  The bed was comfy.  The small kitchen provided space for us to have coffee, and fix our own breakfast in the mornings.  The bathroom was small but quite nice and the towels were plush.   There is only one concern if you are the type that likes to go to bed early.  There is a child in the family, upstairs, and lots of running around well into the evening.  If you don't want to go to sleep before 9 p.m. then this won't be a problem for you.  All in all we would recommend this place.",clean
"Enjoyed staying at the suite in Topanga. Awesome setting, descriptions were perfectly accurate. Communication with Ryan leading up the the visit was great, and his wife (and their friendly dog) warmly greeted us when we arrived. <br/>I'd happily return next time I am in the area.",location
Ryan's location was gorgeous. You have the benefit of the quiet mountains while still being a short drive to the beach or Santa Monica. The suite was clean and comfortable. We visited the Topanga Farmer's Market on Friday and highly recommend the experience- Get the sheep's milk yogurt and visit the coffee guy! ,location
This place was really great. It was a smooth checkin and check out process. The place is very quiet. It was close to a lot of places. It is a very safe place due to it being behind a gate and security patrolling the place. The host also responded quickly to any responses that we had.,location

If I have the opportunity of returning to the area, there would be no question that I will most certainly plan to stay at Ryan's place again. Everything was within close range (the beach, delicious food options, hiking, and touristy things) and the space made me feel right at home. Thanks to Ryan for being such a great host! ",location
"Ryan was extremely helpful with directions and prep, and was also really prompt with a request I made when I arrived. The setting is great up in Topanga, and the lodging, amenities, facilities are terrific. My caveats--it's below the main house so there is some noise sometimes, and if you're wary of steep windy roads or happen to be driving there drunk this may not be the place for you.",location
"This place is perfect located close to the beach, Santa Monica and everything els you want to exprience in LA. <br/><br/>The room and bathroom is privet with its own entrance. Everything is clean and worked out perfectly for our 11 day stay. Ryan is also helpful and just a text away if you have any questions. I truley recommend this place for your stay in LA.",clean

Great place - description was exactly as described and the host was very active in communication.,clean
"We loved our stay with Josh! The home is beautiful and very welcoming of our puppies. Location is excellent and I am an LA native so you can trust me on that. The home is gated and has parking available. Super clean and lovely decor. Josh was an excellent host, he welcomed us late at night and even brought his puppy over to play with ours. I think the price is very fair for the location and the home. Hope you choose to stay at one of Josh's many great listings.",clean

"Great place, really spacious and secluded",location
"Great host.  Josh is a very kind man and very open and friendly if that's what you like.  Dog-friendly was a big plus for me!<br/><br/>Charming house, safe neighborhood.  I learned not to judge the city because K-town is pretty cool and very walkable.   <br/><br/>Bring your fav toiletries, filtered water, coffee- especially if you're particular, like me!  Also, it's LA but it's a little chilly at night.  <br/><br/>",clean
"We stayed in the middle of the worst storm in years (LA style)-sink holes, downed trees and no power (due to the storm).  Josh had all the candles lit when we got there and helped us find our way in the dark.  It was a wet and wild night-so we were glad to have a place to stay.  The beds were comfortable, the house well-located and a grocery store within walking distance.  The yard will contain a medium to large dog-I was worried about my 15 pounder slipping through the gate.  However, it was so wet he wasn't inclined to wander.  LA is congested with limited parking, so happy for the driveway parking that could fit two cars.  Front yard is also gated.  Stove is gas-so that helped with the power being out-still able to make a cup of tea!",location
"We were in L.A. for one night to celebrate my husband's birthday and Josh's place was perfect for what we needed. He was great at communicating, which is much appreciated in the back and forth of checking in, etc. The house was cozy and clean with a cute porch to hang out on. We appreciated his warm greeting when we arrived and letting us know he was laid back, which is comforting to hear when you are staying in someone's home! We will be back next time we are in L.A.!",clean

Nice place to stay... practically near everything if your target place is Cedars-Sinai Hospital.,location
Awesome place!,clean
"Hillaryâs place was terrific--very comfortable and a great location with all kinds of services an easy walk away--practically across the street is a whole gamut of modestly priced food, but within a few a blocks there's a whole range of restaurants both on Third Street, Robertson and San Vicente.  I particularly enjoyed breakfast pastries at The Henry on Robertson one day, but thereâs also a Trader Joeâs a few minute walk away for food to eat in the apartment, and Hillary cleared a whole fridge shelf for me.  Didnât get a chance to use the building amenities but they looked good and parking is very secure.<br/><br/>And Hillary was a gracious host throughout, but after my first day there it felt more like visiting an old friend rather than just a place to stay--and for me thatâs AirBnB at itâs best, so much better than an impersonal hotel or motel.  Would be happy to stay again in the future.",clean
Brenda was very welcoming and accommodating both upon our arrival and throughout our stay. She contacted us to make sure we had everything we needed and of course we did as the cottage was well appointed and equipped. It was clean and fresh. The cottage has a lovely covered patio with a large fig tree in the corner along with other flowering landscaping. It is in a quite neighbor with easy access to the freeway. We will definitely book again upon our next return to LA!,clean
We enjoyed staying here! It's in a good location and has everything that you need. The driveway parking is nice because it's guaranteed parking. Josh was there when we arrived for check in and gave us great suggestions for restaurants and activities. He was also easily reachable by text or phone call. We really enjoyed meeting him and hope to come back soon!,location

Ryan and his family have been amazing!<br/>Also the area where the suite is located is perfect. It was really quite and save there also the suite was so nice and clean.

Ryan was a cool host. He left us a booklet in the room with restaurant and sightseeing recommendations and was open for any questions. The room was as described and very clean and spacious.

We would have no hesitation in recommending Ryan's place to others. Thanks for having us. ",clean
"We had a great time staying in Topanga at Ryan's home!  Topanga is a great jumping off point for exploring the LA area.  For hiking you are a mile from Topanga State Park where there are lots of trails to choose from and for beaches you are a 10 min drive to Topanga State Beach and conveniently located to access all the beaches in Malibu.  Super close to Santa Monica too.<br/><br/>The studio is lovely and comfortable.  It's a really nice size for 2 people with a comfy bed, TV, kitchenette and a Keurig coffee machine for the morning :)  It also has a nice covered porch area you can relax and read or just enjoy the lovely weather.  Host leaves some info about the area in the studio which is helpful when finding local places to eat and drink.  We met the host when we were arriving from a day trip and he offered good options for dinner and beaches to visit.  One of the best AirBNBs we've stayed at.  ",location

"A nice apartment, small but comfortable. We were there with a 10 month-old baby and found everything we needed.

"I rented this Villa because of its proximity to a hospital where my daughter was having a medical procedure -- and because it had a lovely and private back yard.  That said, this little place was a HAVEN.  My daughter and I absolutely loved it!  It was meticulous in every detail -- so clean and quiet!  We couldn't have asked for a more perfect environment to meet our needs during our stay in LA.<br/><br/>But what was even BETTER than the Villa were the owners, Brenda and Martin.  They went above and beyond to accommodate our special needs and to make sure we had MORE than we could have asked for during our stay.  They were truly some of the most caring people we have ever met.  WOW!  Will we be back?  ABSOLUTELY!  Our experience was 5-stars PLUS.  Thank you, Brenda (& Martin)!! ",clean

Josh was an excellent host. We arrived late that evening and he was there to welcome us. He made sure my family was comfortable and that we had what we needed to rest well that night. Josh is just one of those hosts that goes above & beyond to ensure his guests have what they need to feel at home. The next morning I requested more towels and within seconds henresp ok nded and was there.  I appreciate his flexibility the most with my family and I as we were traveling for a medical procedure.

Even though Joshua was not in town the day we checked in his friend who lives next door was helping us moving the luggages inside and show us the house. It's very easy to get  a hold of the host and his friend whenever we needed anything. The house itself is at the center of Koreatown, 5 mins walking to Wilshire Metro station. There's plenty of Korean restaurants, desserts, and buble tea houses around. 2 bedrooms were big for 4 people. Very nice kitchen and bathroom. I love it that they have a small backyard where you can chill in the morning and at the end of the day. Great place!",location

"The location is great, and that combined with the flexible check out are great reasons to choose this place. The apartment is spacious and reasonably equipped (just a few things missing, which Phil was very quick to address), although it's dark and the lack of window blinds means you'll probably have limited privacy in the kitchen/living room areas. The building is great and has everything you'll need for long-term stays. The pipes on the ceiling make the place look cool aesthetically, but they can be a bit of a nuisance at times, specially if you are a light sleeper. Overall a good place to stay in!",location
"Phil was a great, flexible host and made us feel very welcome. Left plenty of amenities (water, paper towels, toiletries) for us on arrival and gave us good information about the area.

"This was my first AirBnb experience and I truly enjoyed my stay there in Topanga. The studio room is neat, clean, and has plenty of comfort and amenities. Though I was there for work, I was hardly in the room, but Ryan and his family were always a phone call away if I ever needed anything. I highly recommend this studio especially it is near to all the great areas such as Santa Monica and Malibu. Thank you Ryan for the enjoyable stay.",clean
"I enjoyed my stay at Ryan's beautiful house. The apartment was cosy,  clean and had everything one would need. I loved the piece and quiet around the place and the closeness to the beaches and hiking trails in the mountains . Car parking onsite is very convenient. ",clean
"This space is exactly as described. A great private space in the hills of Malibu. Great location for hiking, food and beach. We were able to see Malibu, Santa Monica and LA. Ryan was a great host who checked in on us to make sure we were good but gave us space and privacy.  Highly recommend this property but keep in mind it is a windy drive into the studio so drive slowly especially at night. Will definitely stay again. ",location
"Susan and Philip were so gracious with everything.  Such a great experience.  They had both made my fiance feel really welcomed as she was getting ready for our wedding.  The house was nice, cozy, and plenty of space for everyone to get ready.  They just provided such quality hosting for my fiance that I can't express such gratitude.  ",host
"Ryan was an exceptional host. This was our first Airbnb experience, and it definitely set the bar high. While we never got the chance to meet our host - which was totally fine for us and made it seem even more like a private getaway - he was always within reach and prompt to respond to messages. The cozy oasis was exactly as pictured - beautiful, comfortable and clean - and tucked far away into canyons. Everything you need, from how to use the cable/internet and coffee maker to restaurant recommendations and tourist attractions, was in an organized pamphlet upon entry. We didn't have the best or any cell phone reception here, but there is WiFi (password in the pamphlet), which should allow you to do anything you need from your smartphone. We brought our own car, so the parking space was appreciated, but we also used Uber at night, when drinking, so give yourself at least 20 minutes of waiting for that, as the service is generally slower in Malibu. It can get a little cooler at night, especially in Fall/Winter, so be sure to bring warm pajamas and socks and/or a snuggle buddy! Thanks, Ryan! This was exactly what we needed. We'd love to come back!",clean
great location we had many spontaneous adventures and walked to business appts and great meals,location
Josh was awesome to work with! He was always really quick to respond to any of our requests. His house is really nice and spacious and gets great light. It also is in a really convenient location!! Would definitely stay at his place again!,location
"We had to cancel our trip because the health issue of our child. The host decided do not refund money for the booking, because according with policy we can refund 50% only if we cancel reservation 7 days advance.",host
"Very good area, close to gas stations and other stores. The house is old but its very good for 2-3 days. Has almost everything in house. The back yard is just lovely. 2 spots to park your cars. Jashua is the perfect host you want to have lol.",location
"Joshua's place is very old, but well maintained. It honestly looks better in the pictures than in real life, but it's definitely worth to try. We only stayed for one night because it was pet friendly, so kudos for that. We didn't use the shower or kitchen so no sure what's the deal with it, but will definitely recommend this place if you need a big place in the LA area that accepts dogs.",clean
"My sister and I stayed at this home for 10 days. Philip made us feel very welcomed. My sister arrived a day before I did and Philip showed her the city in his car.  He also offered to take us places since we did not have a car.  That was very kind of him. <br/><br/>I loved the interior design of this place. It is sophisticated but practical at the same time. It made us feel at home.<br/><br/>The house is very pretty, clean, comfortable, spacious, and it has all the essential you could need: plenty of towels, pillows, kitchen utensils, cooking basics (salt, pepper, vinegar, spices, tea, coffee, etc.), soap, shampoo, conditioning, cleaning supplies, etc. Philip and Susan also left us eggs, milk, water, which came in handy after my sister's long international flight. The air conditioning is great and easy to regulate (important in the summer since it can get very hot outside during the day). The house is also very private since it is in the back of the property. I also enjoyed having my morning coffee in the beautiful backyard. <br/><br/>The neighborhood is beautiful (that area is often on TV series and movies!) and the location is very convenient. The Trader Joe's and Whole Foods are a 10 minute walk. The train station is a 12 minute walk. We also walked to Caltech several times (my sister was moving to Pasadena to start graduate school there). We even walked to Old Pasadena. <br/><br/>I would definitely stay at their place next time I go to Pasadena. I would also recommend this listing to my friends.<br/><br/>",location
"Philip and Susan made us feel very welcome.  They kindly stocked the kitchen with some groceries for us and provided a nice bottle of wine.  The apartment was lovely. Nice and bright and just as it appears on the website.  Unfortunately it was unseasonable cold when we where in Pasadena, and Philip kindly turned the heat on for us, prior to our arrival.  The the neighborhood was lined with mature trees and beautiful homes.  The apartment is centrally located and we were able to walk to many of our activities. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Pasadena.  The only negative comment that I would have is the bathroom had a shower that was very small.  This was our only negative and we really liked our stay at this apartment.  Thank you",location
Perfact house to rest.<br/>And room condition is the best!!<br/>Really good g (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) d house.,clean

Joshua is a great host. Everything went smoothly I had no problems communicating with him. The house is over 100 years old yet still in very good condition. It's very homey!! Everything was clean and he provided towels ^_^,clean
"This was mine and my boyfriend's first time booking through Airbnb and Ryan was an exceptional host! <br/>Ryan/Host:<br/>He provided thorough directions, had a pamphlet ready of places he suggested around the area, & was very attentive to everything we needed. <br/><br/>Location:<br/>He lives in a beautiful place in Topanga/Malibu. It is pretty far from Pacific coast highway, however the views of nature are to die for! <br/><br/>!Caution!<br/>Be careful at night, because coming up the roads are one way & kind of windy. <br/>There is no heater, so if you're coming during December/January either bring your own mini heater or a thick blanket. <br/><br/>Although we had to leave early due to some things back home, Ryan and his family were very respectful & so kind! I would definitely love to come back! ",host
"Ryan was fantastic-- we met when we first arrived and he was really nice and helpful.  The place is fantastic, very comfortable and quiet.  The description is completely accurate and the addition of the keurig coffee machine was a master stroke!  Being a touring musician myself there is one thing we know really well and that is solid accommodations-- and this place is really well set up.  Plus its location in Topanga makes it really easy to get in and out of (not too deep in the canyon) and go surfing, hiking, head into the city, you name it.  I would absolutely book this room again.",location
We had a great two night stay in Ryan's comfortable and nicely decorated studio apartment. Check-in and check-out were extremely easy and Ryan was very kind in letting us use his printer on our final day. Would definitely stay again -- highly recommend!,clean
"Ryan was a terrific host--prompt, friendly, helpful, welcoming. The space is lovely, very comfortable, and nicely appointed. The location places you just a few minutes from great hiking in Topanga State Park, Tuna Canyon, etc. It's also easy to go north to Calabasas, west to Malibu, and still easy to get down in to Santa Monica and the rest of LA. My wife and I very much look forward to another visit. ",location
"Ryan is a super great host. He helps me and my girlfriend a lot. <br/><br/>For the first thing, the heater fan in this studio is in good condition, it can make the room warm in at most 30 mins from the beginning, and even I turn the heater off at night, the blanket here can also keep us warm. <br/><br/>And the second things I want to express is that Ryan is a customers-first host which I think is awesome. At the first night when we live here, we use the hair dryer we brought and the heater here together. And I think because of the circuit power limit reason, the circuit brake shutdown and we lose power at the night of 11:30 pm. I text with Ryan to tell him that he can fix it tomorrow because I don't want to bother him so late but still in five mins later, he come downstairs to reopen the circuit brake! I think this is the great host I ever meet who try to take care of the customer experience first and I really appreciate it.<br/><br/>And beside, Ryan's studio is a really romantic studio which is really suitable for a couple for a vacation. My girlfriend and I really enjoy it. <br/><br/>For me, I will really recommend this studio to you. And I will really come again for the next time.",host
"Great host! Ryan made everything easy for us, from directions to restaurants and a whole list of things to do while on vacation, the studio living area was clean and cozy! ",clean
"The studio suite was absolutely perfect; clean, comfortable, well decorated and equipped. Exactly as described. The heater in the room worked great! It heated up the entire room in 10 minutes. The location was exactly what we wanted; quite neighborhood in the mountain and yet close to the beach and downtown. I cannot say anything negative about it. <br/>Ryan was an awesome host! The direction to his place we gave us was very helpful as the GPS signal gets really weak as closed to the house. It was one of the best experiences through Airbnb, and I would love to go back again when I visit LA next time.",clean
"Beautiful place, clean, comfortable bed, responsive host. Highly recommended!",clean
"Ryan is a great host, the studio is as exactly described - clean, comfortable and great location.   ",clean
"Thank you Ryan for hosting us, it's a beautifully done apartment in an amazing part of Los Angeles. Enjoyed the clean air and good vibes of Topanga. Can't wait to stay there again. Recommend doing the hike to eagle rock in Topanga state park, Hidden treasures for cool vintage and The Reel Inn down at Topanga beach for great seafood. Thanks again Ryan!",host
"This accommodation is fantastic set in the mountains of Topanga. Ryan is the perfect host, leaving details of where to eat and shop. The beach is only 3 miles away. It's a great location for visiting downtown L.A, Malibu, The Getty Villa etc. The accommodation is of a very high standard. I highly recommend staying at this property.",location
"We have used AirBnb for many of our trips and I must say this has to be the BEST one yet! We came to Cali for some camping and exploring and left wanting more. First of all, the space is clean and tastefully decorated. Topanga is probably one of the most interesting places we have visited thus far. It has the coolest stores, restaurants and coffee shops. If you want to get away from the city THIS is the place to be.",location
"My  boyfriend and I stayed at Ryan's place for 2 nights. It was perfect for what we were looking for. Close to great hiking, Malibu beaches, and great restaurants. It was a little scary driving up the road the first night but we got used to it. Ryan provided us with everything we needed (towels, shampoo, coffee(!), etc.) and provided detailed recommendations to local restaurants. Having a parking space was fantastic too! Would definitely stay here again. ",location
"This Pasadena guesthouse was amazing! Philip greeted us upon arrival, and showed us the delightful guesthouse, which is located behind the main house in a beautiful residential section of Pasadena. Philip and Susan thought of everything! The refrigerator was stocked with breakfast essentials: yogurt, eggs, butter, granola, milk, muffins, juice. There was even a bottle of wine for the evening. This place is a little jewel and you will be thrilled to be able to stay there. It's close to everything and Philip was always available for any questions. We WILL be back!",location
"This was an awesome little place! lots of cool hikes and beaches near by. The apartment was small but cozy. located underneath he main house, you are able to have a lot of privacy for a quiet get away. The apartment has a modern ikea feel and is plenty of space for two people. I definitely would recommend it!<br/>This is a spot for nature lovers. The house its tucked away in the hills of Topanga and requires some maneuvering through tight roads to get there. If you are not confident with your driving ability I would suggest arriving during the day because the roads can be a bit tricking at night.<br/>",location

The house is practically close to everything that you'd want to see, from Hollywood to Downtown to Universal City, everything is close! <br/>- Once arriving we noticed that there is a good amount of parking in the driveway as well as safe street parking. <br/>- There are tons of restaurants as well as a grocery store close by. Make sure to ask Josh about his favorite spots. #InformationOverload :-) <br/>- The house was thoroughly cleaned and we loved the comfy beds.  <br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this listing to other guests!",location
"The location is really great for exploring LA. Walkable to Koreatown, less than ten minutes to Miracle Mile/Beverly Hills. The neighborhood was safe, quiet,  and great for walking my dog. It comfortably accommodated four guests, and the free gated parking is a nice perk.",location
"The place was overall great. There was a leaky AC unit and the gas issue, but Joshua responded very quick and fixed it <br/><br/>One thing we recommended to him is to install screens on the windows so they could be opened without worrying about insects getting inside. <br/><br/>Above all this we appreciated his quick responses and kindness. Not to mention the pineapple cake. Thank you",clean

Philip and Susan were terrific hosts.  We arrived very late in the evening and they were kind enough to stock the kitchen with breakfast items and snacks (even a lovely bottle of wine!) so that we wouldn't have to run out in the morning.  This is a very cozy and convenient location if you are planning to stay in Pasadena. The home was exactly like the photos.  We would very likely stay with them again!,location
My husband and I had a delightful week stay in Pasadena at Phillip and Susan's charming carriage house apartment. The neighborhood was lovely and very close to everything we needed. I love the garden and the outdoor table. The kitchen was great and perfect for cooking for two. ,location
"Philip and Susan were wonderful! Philip was out of town during our stay, but called me multiple times to make sure everything was set and ready for our arrival. I was taking the CA Bar Exam at the Pasadena Convention Center. The location was perfect for my needsâ5 minutes from the testing center. The fridge was stocked and Susan was so nice when we chatted. Although my purpose for staying in Pasadena was stressful, this Airbnb experience made it much better. The neighborhood was quiet, safe, and peaceful. The shower was a bit quirky, but it was part of the charm of the house. Overall, I am so happy I opted to stay here instead of a hotel.",location
Philip and Susan have a wonderful home. Their neighborhood is AMAZING. The units was exactly as described and perfect for what we needed it for. This last weekend as attended a concert at the Rosebowl and the unit was walking distance from it. Philip was very accommodating and readily available if needed which was nice. Highly recommend Philip and Susan and would gladly stay again!,location
"Our hosts provided a welcome selection of items such as milk, eggs and muffins which was very much appreciated.  The accommodation is completely air conditioned which made our stay comfortable, especially during the mini heatwave that we experienced.<br/>Philip was a friendly host and made us feel very welcome. The accommodation had many interesting pictures and books of different types.<br/>We were pleased that we could sit outside to have our dinner on several occasions. <br/>The property is in a very nice safe neighbourhood and is convenient for Old Town Pasadena as well as near to the main highways.",location
"Philip was just delightful, he provided wine and snacks, concise directions and insights into what was going on in Pasadena.  Good location in Pasadena, but a car is helpful. Would stay again if in Pasadena.",location
"This is one of the few times that the place was actually nicer than  the pictures. The rooms had that great feel with the roof line being part of the charm. The kitchen was well stocked for us and that included a very nice bottle of wine. The bed, which is the big question mark was super comfortable. We were in the back and had plenty of privacy.  The neighborhood was beautiful. Stately houses and trees, and wide streets. We are looking forward to returning to explore LA. ",location
"Topanga is a magical rainforest at the top of a mountain, so if you're into that vibe like we were, this place is a gem. A little hard to find initially, especially at night, but the drive is gorgeous in the daytime hours. Pretty close to the beach and the west side of LA (like Venice and Santa Monica) but quite a ways away from east side spots (like Silverlake and Los Feliz). The apartment itself is on the ground floor beneath Ryan's own home, so you hear him (and his dog?) running around right above your heads pretty early in the morning. The bed is comfy, the room is just big enough for 2 people to feel romantically cramped for a day or two, and there are pretty legit curtains so it gets quite dark and feels private. ",location
"The best place to stay in LA! Such a great home, one of the best AirBNB host I've ever had. Josh was super accommodating and friendly, making sure we were all taken care of. He has a beautiful home and it's conveniently located near everything in central LA. My friends and I came to LA for a concert at the Wiltern and Josh's house was a 5 minute walk to the venue, saving us time and money with Uber. We'll be staying with Josh if we're in LA ever again. Great experience.",location

Joshua is a terrific host. He was incredibly thoughtful because he came to check on us and fixed the heater so that it would be nice and warm before we came back from Universal. He even left fresh fruit for us! We had no trouble with communication as he would immediately respond to our messages. <br/><br/>The house is a little worn but its because itâs a historic house thatâs 100 years old. Itâs in a residential area so itâs quiet and relaxing.,host
"Josh is a genial and accommodating host, but this fixer-upper won't be suitable for more than a college Super Bowl party until it's had substantially more fixing up. Badly deteriorated house covered up with a quick coat of paint and some new small appliances.",clean
"Joshua is a great host, and his house is even better than it appears on his page.  Joshua was very responsive and had many suggestions for local attractions and life.  The house is clean, roomy, and has everything needed for a comfortable stay.  And the location was very good for the areas we were exploring (west, central, and north Los Angeles).  Very much worth the price.",clean
"Joshua was quick to respond to our last minute booking & easy to communicate with. His place is clean & the older home is charming. We had everything we needed & really appreciated the off street parking. <br/>Joshua recommended several restaurants within walking distance & the one we tried was very good. <br/>It was a good size for myself, my husband & 3 teens. Liked the location and felt very safe.",clean
Great host and perfect place to stay for a visit to LA,location
"This place is such a gem in the heart of Koreatown! You can uber to a bunch of great spots to explore, eat, drink, hang. I didn't check in until late in the evening around 7:30, Josh had asked me to text him 30minutes before arrival, which I did. When I got to the house, it was nice to see that there was parking for two cars and a gate to ensure privacy if necessary. The house is right next to a main street, so extra parking can be a hit/miss to find. The house has an electronic key pad so there are no worries about losing a key or getting locked out. As soon as I walked in, it was so cozy because he had turned on the heat for us, SO SPACIOUS I loved it!! Amenities from kitchen appliances to bed/bathroom was on point. There were many pots/pans, cups, plates, utensils in the kitchen. The bathrooms were fully stocked with shampoo, body wash, towels, etc. The house was decorated nicely and we felt right at home. Thanks for the marvelous experience. I definitely recommend staying here!",location

"In all our years of renting homes and apartments this was our worst experience. It wreaked of smoke and disinfectant, there were candy wrappers in sofa, broken toilet, broken wifi. Furniture and rooms were shabby, floor sticky. More like a shabby frat house then quality rental. Indeed, host told us 15 people had a party there the night before. For $300 a night this was a major rip off.",clean

You can easily park 2 cars plus find parking on the street. This is a big plus who understand LA parking issues.<br/><br/>We used the kitchen for cooking and it has all the pots, pans, and utensils. When we were leaving he told us to leave everything behind and cleaning will take care of it! Definitely would give him an extra star â­ï¸ if there was an option.",clean

"Pictures of this listing are definitely outdated/not representative of the current condition of the property. The front porch has a ton of shrubbery dangling on the door. Iâm 6â and had to duck every time I entered and exited the property.<br/><br/>More importantly, there were at least two cockroaches that were crawling around and ultimately killed. One dead spider near the kitchen sink, as well as one in one of the bed sheets. <br/><br/>The only saving grace is the location, which was very convenient for me with respect to where I needed to travel to. Iâm very disappointed that this was not a better experience.",clean

A really nice touch was the out door patio, it could be cleaned up a bit out there but for the most part it was really nice to have! If you come in the summer, just bring a fan or something because it does get hot in the bedrooms. The kitchen and living room stay nice and cool because thatâs where the unit is located.

"Very Central spot in LA. Could have been a little cleaner, but overall great value. Joshua was very responsive and the place was what we needed.",location
Joshua was the most friendly host. My family came to LA and he took great care of them. The place was spotless and the area was quiet but close to all the fun spots of LA. I highly recommend Joshuaâs place!,clean

I totally loved the place and thanks for your quick response Joshua..,location
"Thus cosy little cottage is located in a wonderful upscale residential area in Pasadena, within walking distance to shops, restaurants, and Caltech. We loved the arty decorations, comfortable bed and awesome patio. ",location
"Wonderful stay!  Mix of business and pleasure.  My husband had the car for work on Friday.  I walked in the neighborhood and to Old Downtown.  Lovely!  Then relaxed on the private patio with a glass of wine from one of the (two!) bottles Philip left for us, and munched on snacks which he also provided.  On that note, the place is well stocked with toiletries, including sunscreen, basics for cooking and everything for first evening snacks and breakfast.  <br/>Over the weekend, my husband and I hiked in the nearby Angeles National Park and visited Huntington Library and Botanical Gardens.  Fabulous!  Philip is very helpful in providing tips and advice on what to see and getting around.<br/>Only cautions are the same as others have given:  if you classify yourself as big and tall, you may be challenged by the low ceilings cozy spaces and small shower.  We found these aspects added to the charm and did nothing to detract from the light, airy feel of the place.  Would definitely stay again!!",location
"Great place to stay in a quiet, beautiful neighborhood!  ",location
"Philip and Susan were wonderful hosts. Their guesthouse is incredibly charming and settled in a beautiful neighborhood. The place was clean, quiet at night, and had basic amenities for guests. I will definitely try to book again on my next trip to Pasadena. ",clean
"Philip and Susan's place is clean, comfortable, and quite lovely. We really enjoyed our time (and the complimentary snacks and wine!). They were good communicators and even let us check-in early. Would stay again. ",clean
Philip and Susan's place is excellent. It is very conveniently located in a lovely neighborhood in Pasadena. It is a beautifully furnished and well appointed place. It has a fantastic kitchen with a large fridge and a gas stove and everything you need to cook meals. The bed is extremely comfortable and the bedroom very pretty and restful. It is great to have a private patio too! Philip stocked the fridge with snacks and breakfast food. He was totally available and eager to answer questions and be of assistance.    I can't say enough good things! Can't wait to return. ,location
Philip and Susan were fantastic hosts. Great funky space! Well stocked and lovely space to sit outside in the yard.,location

"This is a charming spot in a quiet beautiful neighborhood. The accommodations were clean, comfortable, and private. Philip was easy to communicate with and lots of fun to visit with. The snacks and breakfast items were greatly appreciated. We'd definitely return again!  Thank you Philip!!!",clean
"A lovely stay in a space that really embodies âquaint and charming.â  The space has the feel of a sea-side cottage. As others, including the host, have noted the slanted ceilings in the bedroom and bathroom combined with the low ceiling in the shower would be a challenge for tall or large-framed guests. However, because this was clearly disclosed we were not bothered by it at allâ just something to note before booking!  Likewise, the narrow stairway (which I quite liked) would not make this a good space for guests with mobility issues or trouble with stairs. <br/>The bed/linens were crazy comfortable and one of my favorite parts of our stay. <br/>The interior design is light and airy with a touch of whimsy.  Really loved the art and vintage tin toys throughout the space. <br/>The host went above and beyond with hospitality, including giving advance advice about transportation, being patient with our travel delays that pushed our arrival to around midnight, and picking us up from the local Metro stop (which is very near and an easy walk when youâre not arriving super late after a day of travel disasters!) <br/>The provided breakfast/snacks were a lifesaver after an arduous day of travel and let us get out the door early for our convention the next day without having to hunt up a restaurant first!<br/>The host checked in daily by text message and offered further services for local info and even a ride back to the train if we needed it. <br/>If I have one complaint it is that the stairwell/entry has a musty smell like older wooden houses sometimes get, but I stopped noticing it after a few hours. It was not a terrible smell, but might bother some who are very sensitive to scents. <br/>Overall a lovely stay and would absolutely recommend to traveling couples or solo travelers as a cozy home base for exploring Pasadena and/or LA area.",space
"This is a house in the back of the main house on a beautiful old street, It is quiet and gracious. The entire living area however is upstairs. The entry is a small room with the TV and the closet. The AC works well. The refrigerator is stocked with what one would need for breakfast, snacks and wine were provided in a welcome basket.",location
"This is a wonderful rental. The kitchen has the best housewares of any AirBNB we have stayed at. Dishes, pots, cutting board, coffee maker, knives, glasses- everything you need to make breakfast, including the food! The outdoor area is a wonderful and pretty place to relax. We walked to Old Town for shopping and restaurants. Downtown LA was an affordable Uber ride away. Our hosts provided a welcome bottle of wine and eggs, yogurt, English muffins, bottled water and even half and half and coffee!  We loved our stay!",clean
"Very clean place, will def stay here again.",clean
"Accurate description and pictures. However, the place was much older than I was expecting and there was always a lingering cigarette smell as soon as you walk into the house.",clean
Great host and great location!,location
"Joshua's place met all of our needs and the location couldn't be better. All of the locations we wanted to visit in Koreatown were within walking distance, which was definitely nice.",location
"Joshua responded almost immediately upon requesting His property. We arrive late at night, and the most welcoming lights and home was waiting for us after a 12 hr day at the hospital. We felt safe and comfortable",location
"Joshua made my first Airbnb experience great! His instructions and details in the description was good enough that I didnât have any questions for him over the phone. He responded quick and was nicer than I expected him to be! If Iâm ever in LA again, I will most definitely come back to this house because of the hospitality and the aesthetics of the home (:",host

Joshua's place location is very convenient and having a parking space is a big plus.,location
"Loved my stay at this place! Joshua was a super host! He made sure we had a good time and was really quick in response. He was really flexible with the check in / out as well. The house was really cute, clean and spacious. The house is located basically in the heart of ktown and is really convenient. Overall loved my stay and I would stay here again!",clean
"This is a very pleasant house to hang out in during the day. Lots of light and air flow, reasonably quiet, enclosed front yard for the dogs and enclosed front patio so that you can leave the front door open when you are home and get a nice breeze going.<br/><br/>The neighborhood is close to Hollywood, which was very convenient for us.  I recommend Document Coffee Bar, a five minute walk. A large grocery store (Ralphs) is close walking distance as well.<br/><br/>The neighborhood is a little dirty. People leave trash strewn around and don't pick up after their pets. However I never felt unsafe, and we walked around the neighborhood quite a bit with our dogs. <br/><br/>In my experience, LA is a very dog friendly place, and this neighborhood is the same.<br/><br/>The house had a pretty strong smell of fish when we first arrived, but after a day with the windows open, that smell was gone.<br/><br/>The hot water is warmish, not hot, a little uncomfortable for showering.<br/><br/>The Joshua is conscientious had has good communication.",location
We flew into town for a concert and the host was responsive and the house was terrific.  I would return again.,host
Thank you for letting my wife and I stay for the night! I stayed a few months back here with some friends and we all had a great time and was very accommodating. Since my last visit he has remodeled the interior made it more roomier with delightful amenities. Will definitely keep you in mind for future visits! <br/>Josh is very informative on if you want to sight see in the area or shop locally.,location

We had the best time at Ryan's Airbnb in Topanga! The apartment is really nice and clean and we felt home right away! It's only a short drive through the epic scenery to Malibu and Santa Monica. Ryan recommended to hike Eagle Rock and it was so beautiful and only 10 min away. We will be back for sure!!!! Thank you so much for an amazing time!,clean
"We were very pleased with our stay in Ryan's home!  It was so nice to get away from the chaos of Santa Monica and LA, yet we were a very short drive from the beach/restaurants.  We loved the simplistic, decluttered, and fresh decor of the space- makes you feel like you are truly getting away for the weekend.  Overall, we had an excellent experience and our stay was exactly what we were looking for! ",clean
What a lovely place to stay. Very quiet and out of the way. Really appreciated coming back to such serenity after a day of fun.  Ryan was very responsive to our requests for recommendations and providing a pack and play. Would totally stay here again and again. ,location
"Ryan was great! Even though we got in late, he came out and greeted us with his dog and let us know we could text him if we needed anything. The studio was perfect. Spacious, clean, modern, and smelled great. We loved the music theme. This was our first time staying in Topanga and it is definitely a unique area. Wish we had more time to explore the little shops in Topanga Canyon but I highly recommend breakfast at Topanga Table. Thanks Ryan!",clean
Great place to hide away from busy LA city. Very comfortable room with good taste. Very responsive host.,location
"Let me start by saying what a wonderful stay this was. Topanga is truly a beautiful escape from the wild LA area. Ryan did everything right to ensure our trip was equipped with the proper accommodations, making it as comfortable as possible. Perfect sized studio for two, conveniently located off the main road, that was clean and modern. Ryan is indeed a super host and we cannot stress enough how comfortable and enjoyable our stay was. We will be back! ",clean

"We had a great stay at Ryan' s apartment. Ryan's house is situated in the mountains of Topanga with a wonderful view. It is near the beaches of Malibu. The apartment is modern, clean and large. We had everything that we needed. Ryan was an attentive host. We could not be happier. Thank you!",location
"The stay was perfect and just as described! It was in a quiet neighborhood that is so close to Topanga State Park and all the beaches. It was just what we were looking for on our trip to get a little outside the main drag and relax. Had everything we needed, including little things we didn't realized we needed like beach towels. This was the perfect little escape!",location
We had a great time at Ryans place. Topenga was the perfect location for us with Zuma beach and our favourite LA places close by. Ryan was a very friendly host and we would love to return.,location

Great location. <br/>Surrounded by outstanding architecture and galleries. <br/>A gem.,location

Willing to provide dining and site seeing suggestions. Also, arranged the street parking permit for us which was much appreciated.<br/>All in all, a perfect place to stay for us. Will return on the future.",clean
Lovely neighborhood. We really enjoyed that the refrigerator and pantry were stocked with breakfast fixings as well as snacks. The space had great character.,location
"Superhost is right!  From booking to check out, Philip & Susan made our stay perfect.  This lovely cottage is comfortable, cozy and clean.  We felt at home immediately and wished we could stay longer (or move in!).  The neighborhood is spectacular, very safe and an enjoyable walk.  The majority of the home is upstairs, so keep that in mind if you have difficulty with stairs.  There is ample street parking near their home and less than a mile away is a bustling area with restaurants and shops.  I am looking forward to visiting again and staying longer so I can drink coffee in the garden!  Thank you Philip & Susan!",location
We stayed in Philip and Susan's place while visiting Caltech with our son. Campus is within walking distance (took us about 30 minutes). The neighborhood is beautiful. Our hosts were very welcoming and helpful and had left us a few breakfast items and a lovely bottle of wine!,location

Great spot near Cal Tech and local transit!,location
"This review was written by my mother, who stayed with Phil and Susan earlier this month:<br/><br/><br/>Discovering Phil and Susanâs wonderful Air B&B earlier this month during a long weekend in Pasadena (visiting my daughter and her boyfriend) was one of the many highlights of a great trip, and I am already looking forward to returning on future trips to LA.  The house is in a lovely residential neighborhood near the CalTech campus and downtown Pasadena. The accommodations â a two-story apartment in a converted garage at the far end of their back yard -- were clean, spacious, and full of light. Downstairs was a sitting room; upstairs, the bedroom (incredibly comfortable bed!), bath and kitchen. The AC, WiFi, and cable TV all worked beautifully. The kitchen had been prepped with everything I could have possibly needed â coffee, milk, eggs, snacks, cheese and crackers, and even a lovely bottle of wine that I shared with my daughter on the beautiful patio just outside â shady or sun-dappled, depending on where one sat.  Bookshelves upstairs and downstairs offered quirky and thought-provoking books to peruse (including wonderful guides to LA and the California coast); gorgeous framed broadsheets of poetry by Dana Gioia were an added treat. Phil and Susan were incredibly gracious hosts, offering me the perfect balance of attentiveness and privacy, and my wide-ranging conversations with Phil about teaching, poetry, and a host of other topics are still resonating with me.  FIVE STARS!!",location
"The spot is perfect for couples or singles looking for a quiet getaway while staying in the Los Angeles area. Philip was the kindest host, greeting us warmly with a bottle of wine chilling in the fridge. He really made sure to make us feel comfortable and gave us great recommendations! The location is great, in a beautiful quiet neighborhood. We spent every night sitting in the garden, enjoying the peace and beautiful weather. 10/10!",location
"A lovely retreat after a long day of touring and visiting, beautiful sunny rooms to wake up to, fluffy towels, comfortable bed, delicious breakfast items and pantry snacks, beautiful neighborhood, convenient parking, close to Pasadena downtown, easy access to freeways, friendly hosts. Next time we go I want to make sure we leave time in our schedule to sit in their beautiful garden with a glass of wine (which the host brought us) or a cup of tea. Thank you for a lovely weekend!!",location
"This is a charming cottage!  Light & bright, quiet, verdant and well located in Pasadena.  Host provided very nice touches....I arrived late & through traffic; the wine in the 'fridge was much appreciated as were the eggs, coffee and muffins stocked for the next morning.  Highly recommend.",location
"Philip & Susan's guest house is so charming/comfortable and as hosts, they are awesome! We felt so very welcomed. Also, there were a number of very thoughtful personal touches in the house upon our arrival. The location is in one of the loveliest areas of Pasadena and our morning walks were beautiful! We would never hesitate to stay with Philip & Susan again.",location
"Spent a month at Philip and Susan's place while in town for work. Would highly recommend it for any length of stay. The location was particularly good: very nice residential area but within walking distance of Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, coffee shops, etc. Philip was also an outstanding host.",location
"At the risk of making this place too popular, we simply must say we love staying here. Phillip thinks of everything. In the future we will plan our stats in Pasadena around the availability of this property.",location
"We loved staying at Ryan's place during our trip! The guest house is perfect, and such a relaxing place to come back to after a long day exploring the area. We found the location very convenient to both the beach and Los Angeles. Ryan and his family are so welcoming, and were available if we needed anything (which we didn't because the space is perfect). I definitely recommend staying here if you get the chance, they have certainly earned their Superhost status! ",host
"The reviews did not steer us wrong. Ryan was awesome. Answered every question we had in a timely manner, gave us suggestions (on top of the ones he had provided in the unit itself) and even helped us find another place to stay the day after we left his place. Would no question come back to stay with him in this lovely place. It was so clean and beautifully decorated and he was a gracious and accommodating host. Worthy of the the ""super host"" title and more!!!<br/><br/>The unit itself was perfect for what we were looking for. Well put together, great location, keurig for us to make coffee in the morning. My girlfriend and I left with no bad things to say. <br/><br/>Location as mentioned is very quite and up in the hills. The ONLY issue, and it has nothing to do with the host but will be helpful for reviews, is that it is hard to get an uber/lyft to get to places nearby. So plan on driving and plan ahead in that regard! <br/><br/>Otherwise, 10000% recommend. Thanks again, Ryan!",clean
"We had great instructions and we found Ryan's place really easily. Everything is as described and the location is set beautifully within the Topanga region. We settled well and enjoyed our lodgings, it is equipped to cook if you chose to and coffee was provided. There was useful information left of local restaurants and stores which we found really helpful. Overall we really enjoyed our stay and would recommend to our friends and family. ",location

It was unusually cold while we were there, but the area heaters worked just fine. The neighbor's dog barked fairly regularly (as early as 6am and after 11 at night) but otherwise the location is fantastic and quiet, a great place to explore Pasadena from.",location

We loved it and highly recommend Philip's place for anyone looking to stay in Pasadena!",clean
"This cozy cottage was our home away from home for almost a week. The thoughtfulness of the hosts to offer the food, drinks, toiletries were a pleasant surprise! The decor and comfort of the house held knowledge expanding opportunities the more we explored the large selection of books, art and information provided about the history of the area. The upstairs kitchen and bedroom were the perfect separation from the downstairs sitting room where we had ample space to set up our portable sound lounge. We relaxed under the shade of the orange trees and enjoyed peacefulness of the yard. This is a perfect place for anyone who appreciates modern comforts mixed within the historic charm of  nostalgic architecture. It was such a pleasure to stay here and I would recommend experiencing it to anyone.",location

"Our second stay with Philip and it was exactly as I remembered - outstanding hospitality!! He anticipated our every need and provided so much more.  As for location, couldnât be a better place to stay for enjoying all that Pasadena has to offer.  Much is within walking distance or a quick Lyft ride.  And the place is sunny, bright, well stocked and very comfortable. Only caution is for those who may have trouble with stairs.  And if youâre tall, like we are, watch out for the pitches in the bedroomâs ceiling - just part of the charm!<br/><br/>My husband and I prefer staying with Air B&B and consider Philip one of our best hosts. Hope to see you again soon, Philip!",location
Outstanding hospitality!  Location is great and amenities were superb. Will stay again!,location
We are so happy to have found this place in Pasadena. It is simply perfect. A great bedroom with a comfortable queen bed and a lovely kitchen to cook a few breakfasts. Philip is the best host. He provides everything you might want for your stay. We will be back next year.,location
This was our third stay in the past 3 years and Philipâs guest house has become our home away from home when visiting our daughter & family in Pasadena. Philip is an amazing host and his guest house is charming and most comfortable. The personal touches and extra amenities are outstanding and the location is in a beautiful neighbourhood of Pasadena. Our future trips to Pasadena will see us staying at Philipâs whenever it is available!,location
Philip is an excellent host. The house is charming and situated off of an attractive and quiet residential street conveniently proximate to Old Pasadena. Couldnât have worked out better.,location

A beautiful place to walk around, but close to everything. Phillip is a wonderful host. He is very responsive and the special touches made it a great stay. He had wine and cheese available as well as breakfast fixings and all the condiments we might need. Truly a home away from home. It is a little (but roomy) home away from home. It is immaculately clean. We definitely will stay there again.",clean
"This lodging is a simple and immaculate apartment with everything youâd need to stay for a day or a month. There were basic food and snack items sufficient for all of our breakfasts and more. Philip was readily available with information about what to visit in the area. The best feature for us was its location, within easy walking distance of markets, restaurants, shops and the Metro light rail station.  The neighborhood is quiet and full of lovely older homes. We plan to return!",location
A wonderful experience in this quaint guest house. The description and head's up about some of the small spaces was right on and not an issue for us. Quiet neighborhood and very safe for walks. Appreciated all of the food and beverages that were provided. The only thing a little awkward was that the closet for clothes was downstairs in the living room while the bedroom and bath were upstairs. The living room ended up being where the suitcases stayed. Not a problem for us as we were not there alot and there really wasn't room for a closet upstairs (there was space for suitcases and folded clothes upstairs) A small thing compared to all of the other nice touches and very friendly and helpful host! We would love to come back and spend more time.,location
"My only regret about my stay at Philip & Susan's place is that my trip to Pasadena was so full that I never really had a chance to speak with them a bit more than I did. From my brief encounters, they seemed like kindred spirits, interested and engaged in arts and culture. Their guest cottage is thoughtfully laid out, comfortable, and extremely well-situated. I hope to be able to repeat the pleasure when I am next in the area. Many, many thanks.",location
Cute place in a beautiful neighborhood. Thoughtful and communicative host!,location
Philipâs place is perfect for a visit to East LA. Heâs welcoming and thoughtful; this must be at least our fifth or sixth stay. All of our expectations are met.,location

Kind family and great location.,location
We are so glad we chose this location for our stay to visit family and assist in and celebrate the birth of our new grandson. The accommodations and lovely location were perfect for our needs and Philip and Susan wonderful and thoughtful hosts.,location
"Phillip and his wife were great hosts. Their rental cottage was neatly organized and generously stocked with cookies, breakfast items, and coffee. The interior decor evoked an artistic flair that is befitting of an area like Pasadena and itâs rich cultural history. Adjacent to the guest cottage is a shaded patio area that is great for a relaxing afternoon read. The rental space has a dedicated air conditioning unit that reliably cooled the unit down to 70 degrees with quiet operation. One limitation of the property itself, however, is the low ceilings. Phillip was forthcoming in the listing description that taller individuals may feel cramped, however even at a modest 6 feet, I found myself bumping my head frequently while moving from the kitchen to the bedroom. On the service front, we could not have asked for a better experience from our hosts who are certainly deserving of their âsuperâ designation on Airbnb. My only suggestion for refinement of the guest experience would be to purchase and install a more modern router so the WiFi is more reliable. Thank you again for everything!<br/><br/>-Mark & Ashley",clean
Super hosts and very attentive. Philip and his wife are excellent and the guest house is also very lovely.  Ideal for a couple or perhaps a family with one child.    Great location and in a very beautiful and safe area of Pasadena.  Our stay was a long term one and very good set up.  Also Philip has upgraded the wifi and intrenet improving the connection which is also very helpful.  Would love to stay again!,location
We had a short but great stay at Philipâs place this weekend. The instructions and communication around check-in were extremely clear. The guest house is easily accessible and filled with very thoughtful touches. There were some snacks in the fridge upon arrival and the air conditioning had been turned on in advance of our check-in which was extra appreciated during the record breaking heat! We were able to use the outdoor sitting area for dinner both nights and enjoyed a nice walk around the beautiful and safe neighborhood. Highly recommend and we hope to stay again!,location
"This is an incredibly charming back house hosted by Philip and his wife, who really go out of their way to make sure that you're comfortable during your stay. The aesthetic touches inside are really wonderful and it's nice to have a full kitchen available.<br/><br/>Keep in mind though that if you're a tall person (6ft or over) then sadly this won't be the place for you, as it's a century old house and you'll have to duck to get around ð But If you're not that tall then it's highly recommended!",location

They have a special warm heart! This home has been a treasure in their family for many years and they really try hard to keep the originality of the home. If you stay here; please keep it this way. <br/><br/>The host welcomes you and provides great instructions and what you need to know and is prompt in replies. The home is well cared for and offers all amenities as stated and more. There was a Wine Bottle, kettle corn, coffee ground, and so much more. Bathroom has so much you need if you forget. Beddings are more than you need, quilts very nice. <br/><br/>Books galore for quiet readings downstairs or in the garden. You will find a great reading in this place for sure. I loved a few books. He has great guides of the neighborhood and locations for you to visit of the hot spots near by.<br/><br/>Property has unique features that are from the era of when it was built, so expect the place to be extremely unique and special. Itâs located in the Madison Heights location of Pasadena. This era was special when originally built. <br/><br/>California is know for best oranges and wines. This property has a couple orange trees and if you do readings on wines, you will know most all properties here the original owners of the land and owners that built the neighborhood were Wine Growers and Orange growers. Most all neighbors take care of their homes. This is a special place! Very quiet and please keep it that way. This is a place where you can find peace during a difficult time.<br/><br/>If you love morning and evening walks this place is located in a sweet place. Itâs the safest and if you appreciate Old World Architecture, stay here. This property is close to the Father of the Bride. So I really know the neighborhood well. Thatâs why I selected this place to stay versus other comparables. <br/><br/>Many well known properties built in the late 1800s (too many to name and list). Bring your study book with you so you can know exactly what you are looking for of that is your focus.<br/><br/>The Garden is beautiful with great use of space. They have a dog, sweet and darling as can be. She loves a play game of ball. Very cute! <br/><br/>PS. I live not far away, less than 2 miles away and I will say that this spot is special and you can find peace. Thank you again!",host
"Amazing and outstanding hosts ! They were so gracious , generous and went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable during our month stay.<br/>This is a charming cottage exactly as advertised and  had a cosy feel ! We enjoyed the patio under the shade of the orange trees and loved the garden ! The cottage is  well decorated, carefully cleaned and they were more amenities that we could have hope for and they provide essentials with excellent brand names  . Philips and Susan welcomed us with wine,cheese, crackers, coffee , water which we thought was a nice touch.They even treated us during our stay  with delicious fresh bread and fruit pie ... we were delighted ! <br/>It was hard to say goodbye to them and to their cute dog â Rosieâ. She was so sweet ! <br/>It was a home away from home.<br/>Definitely will be booking this place again when we have another California trip . Hope it will be soon ! <br/>We would highly recommend this historical, nice and safe neighborhood and these wonderful hosts !",location
"We stay at airbnbs often but this experience was truly a stand out for hospitality. Phillip could not have been more welcoming and accommodating. We completely felt at home and comfortable. The airbnb is a charming little house (behind Philips beautiful house) thoughtfully stocked with everything you need - plus it opens to a beautiful garden and outdoor space. We only stayed 4 nights but could easily imagine ourselves staying much longer! The wifi connection is incredibly strong and great for working remote. I spent a lot of time on video calls from the garden since the wifi was even strong outside. In addition, this place is located in the most picturesque section of Pasadena  and you can easily walk to restaurants, cafes, etc.  I cannot recommend this location more, especially if you are looking to explore Pasadena while working remote.",location
"Philip and Susan's place is awesome! They are super SUPER hosts! Beautiful place in a great location near The Huntington and Lacy Park.  Everything was clean and very well stocked!   They offered us things we never expected, and made our visit during these challenging covid times, so enjoyable!  We will definitely be back in the future.",clean
"The guest home is quaint, comfy, filled with sunlight, and everything I could ever hope for - whether it be for a short or long stay! Philip is welcoming, caring, and a wonderful communicator. I felt well cared for from the time I booked my stay to the time I departed. Their outdoor area is a beautiful, tranquil space to enjoy Southern California's sunshine. I wholeheartedly recommend this AirBnB!",location

"Great place to stay, location is ideal for West Hollywood/Beverly Hills. Joshua was very responsive.",location
"The home is spacious and the garden and patios are nice.<br/><br/>However this is an older home, which isnât accurately portrayed in the description. As it is an older home, the insulation is lacking and the pipes are old. Although it is LA, it still gets cold in December and the house was freezing cold, and the hallway furnace was broken, putting a damper on our stay.",location
"Great experience, I would definitely stay here again.",clean
The location is great and convenient a tad but cold but just a bit on the expensive side worth it,location

This is a pretty old run down house ... the heaters doesnât work ... there were bugs and misquotes ...the place is too cold and if you have kids avoid this place ...,clean
Stayed at Ryan's place for 2 nights and it was absolutely wonderful! He was very friendly when he greeted us and asked us if we needed anything just to ask him. He interacted with us at times when we would head back to his lovely home he is a great host and the stay was just as I imagined if not better. The room was kept clean when we got there and it smelt like a brand new hotel room. He had everything we needed and even had beach towels and a cooler incase you forgot yours. The set up was wonderful and I didn't want to leave his beautiful house in Topanga. I would highly recommend you to stay here because the experience was great!,clean
"Such a cute little place and the location is so pretty. Enjoyed the night walk. Felt super safe. <br/>They had basically everything you need to cook your food. Bathroom was so cute and tiny. Bedroom was very unique to sleep in. Bed felt nice to sleep on and not hard. Super clean place, had disinfecting wipes and hand sanitizers. <br/>Not going to lie the stairs made me nervous because I didnât want to accidentally break them they seem fragile to me. It also squeaks a lot. <br/>But no complaints! <br/>The place can be tiny for people that are like 6ft above. Maybe <br/>I would really recommend this place. ð",clean
"This was a nice private unit in a quiet neighborhood conveniently located to activities in Pasadena. The unit was extremely well-stocked with toiletries, coffee and snacks. Philip's daughter greeted us upon arrival and made sure we had everything we needed. We'd be happy to stay here again.",clean
"This is a lovely place in a beautiful neighborhood. The hosts were very welcoming and had the apartment nicely stocked. The garden was pleasant and the place is walking distance to coffee shops, restaurants, and Trader Joeâs. I stayed for two weeks and it felt like home away from home.",location
"This is a charming old guest house in a wonderful neighborhood in Pasadena. It's like a dollhouse! Living area downstairs with Roku TV, then a steep set of stairs up to small kitchen, bath with shower and bedroom. Be aware, ceilings are low upstairs. Outdoor sitting area in a lovely yard, and a dog on premises. We saw wild parrots! Very quiet area. No street parking, so you must pull into the drive by a certain time so homeowners can park behind you. Updated A/C and wifi. Philip is very friendly and kind, with great tips for walks and neighborhood information.",location
This place was wonderful and Ryan was extremely communicative and helpful. Great location.,location
Everything went smoothly and we had a nice stay. We recommend this place if you want a reasonably priced apartment outside of the city and close to the Malibu beaches.,location
"We loved staying in this bright, clean, and cozy guesthouse for our week in Pasadena. The host family has put in a lot of care to make sure their guests are comfortable with a generously stocked kitchen and bathroom, as well as spacious outdoor seating areas with well-tended landscaping. Reaching out to the hosts while staying here was easy to do, they are friendly and respond quickly. The neighborhood is a lovely place to walk around in: full of historic homes and quiet- lots of happy bird songs in the morning with your coffee, smells of flowering trees and eucalyptus while walking to the Trader Joes nearby. The space feels loved, the stay was awesome.",clean
"This is perfectly located near all the great places in Pasadena! It was well stocked, clean, and lovely! I would stay here again!",clean
"We truly felt welcomed at this location.  The family hosting us was thoughtful & thorough about preparations, and communication with them was very easy.  They provided a clean and comfortable place for the two of us to stay.  Because of the little extras they provided, their place had the feel of a friend's place.  As it was an all-around pleasure, we would happily stay there again.",clean
Lovely in-law unit in a gorgeous part of Pasadena. It was a very comfortable area for our stay. I was surprised how well-stocked the kitchen and bathroom were. EsmÃ© was very helpful and communicative. Thanks for everything!,location
"We had a totally enjoyable stay at this cozy little guest house. Philip, Susan, and Esme are true âSuperhostsâ. They are friendly, responsive, and went out of their way to make our stay the best. The apartment is very homey and clean. As a retired art teacher, I enjoyed the eclectic collection of artwork adorning the rooms. I wish I had time to read some of the books. The kitchen was so well stocked that we did not need to immediately rush out to buy groceries for breakfast the first morning after traveling across the county. That was greatly appreciated. We stayed a week and the place felt like home by the time we left. The patio and gardens are peaceful and lovely. Rosie the Goldendoodle is the most friendly and laid-back pup I have ever met. The neighborhood is so beautiful and walkable with architectural gems and eye-catching gardens that we sometimes walked morning and evening. I hope to stay there again at some point.",clean
"This beautiful little house situated in a very quiet Pasadena neighborhood proved to be the perfect base of operations for my work at several locations in the Los Angeles area.  EsmÃ©, Phillip, and Susan were perfect hosts and I could not have been happier with my stay.",location
"This place cannot be beat. It is in a great neighborhood. The hosts are the best.  The apartment is well furnished, very clean, and the bed is comfy. We cooked breakfast 5 out of 6 days and found everything needed including condiments. We love staying here. It is our favorite place in Pasadena .You can't go wrong staying here.",clean
"This is a fantastic place, with a fantastic host and location.  Will definitely be back soon.",location
"The listing was exactly as described and depicted in the photos. It's in an awesome neighborhood and very close to a lot of the things you'd want to do in Pasadena. EsmÃ© was very responsive. If you're coming with a car, coordinating with parking in the driveway was a breeze. Street parking is also plentiful, and now with the passport app, you can secure a permit for overnight parking on your phone. The only caveat we'd give is that the slanted ceilings would probably pose a challenge for people on the taller side. It wasn't an issue for me, but it was something my partner had to consider and he's just under 6 feet. He also said the shower and shower head were a bit difficult for him. Otherwise, we really enjoyed our stay.",location
"We had a wonderful, week-long stay at Philip's place.  The comfortable apartment is in an absolutely lovely neighborhood.  The host was very welcoming. Check-in and communication were great.  The amenities and tasty goodies were much appreciated!",location
"Philip and Susan's home is lovely. We had everything that we needed for a quiet, comfortable stay, along with many lovely little touches. Philip is an enthusiastic art fan, and, was so gracious to share his love of art with us. Philip, Susan, and Esme are such gracious hosts and were so welcoming and helpful. The home was just perfect for my husband and I -- comfortable, inviting, and, the upstairs is full of sunlight during the day, thanks to the abundance of windows. The neighborhood is full of beautiful,  historic homes and we enjoyed the scenery during our daily walks. We certainly enjoyed our stay!",location

"INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE!! We were greeted by Ryan when we arrived, he helped us with our bags and showed us around personally. He made us feel like we were staying with friends!<br/>AMAZING LOCATION!! Only 4 miles off of PCH, perfectly set between Santa Monica and Malibu. Could not be more perfect, it's even just far enough away from the city that you get to fall asleep to the crickets chirping. 10 minutes to Venice Beach, and around 30 mins to more pristine beaches in Malibu like El Matador. <br/>If you are looking for a getaway to enjoy the beach and natural side of the LA area, or even just escape the city for a couple days, I HIGHLY suggest Ryan's place. Will definitely be back!!",location
"Ryan is a great host, very friendly, welcoming, and accommodating.  The space is very pretty and has all the conveniences one could want (great shower!), including a small refrigerator, microwave, cooktop, and cooking accessories.   This is in a secluded area, so it was helpful to us to be able to pick up food so we didn't have to go back out again once we had arrived ""home"", and it also helped us save money instead of eating at restaurants.   The bed was extremely comfortable (on a par with the Sheraton Sweetsleeper);  we had the best rest here of any place we have ever stayed.  ",location

The apartment was very clean and the kitchen, while small, had all the necessities.   The bedroom is quite large and we found the bed to be comfortable.  The bathroom is also adequate, though the shower may be challenging for tall folks.  Philip provided a very easy and convenient check-in and was very easy to communicate with.",clean

Weâve stayed at Philipâs on numerous trips to LA. It is our favorite AirBnB. Always a pleasure!,location
This place is such a find. Always our first choice when coming to Pasadena to visit family.,location
"What a great place to stay!  The atmosphere was so pleasant that I wanted to hang out under the orange trees with a book from the shelves instead of going about my business.  I appreciated all kinds of things about this place, including kitchen knives that were actually sharp, extra towels, and the bedroom blackout curtains. Communication was fast and easy.  Ceilings are a little low under the roof in some places, so for once I was happy to be short. Group vusitors might also want to be aware that the different spaces are separatedn physically, but only the bathroom has an actual door, so sounds will carry between rooms. None of this changes the fact this back house was overall a delightful place to stay: peaceful, well-located,  comfortable.  Would definitely stay again.",clean
"Everything is clean and as advertised. I especially appreciate the first aid box, as I needed a band-aid during the stay. Check in and communication were convenient. The location is excellent.",clean
"This place was exactly as advertised and more. Perfect location, very clean, thoughtfully decorated. Esme's communication was wonderful. She was especially accommodating when we last minute needed to park a car in the driveway. All of Pasadena is at your fingertips when you stay here- easy to get into town and easy drive to the surrounding areas. We will absolutely be staying here again next time we are in Pasadena!",clean
"We had a delightful stay in this cozy private stand-alone house in the backyard of a very nice Pasadena neighborhood. Great location with easy access to everything in immediate area and greater LA. Low ceilings a slight issue for tall people, but well worth a little ducking for all the benefits, including a very peaceful backyard garden for rest and recuperation between outings.",location
"Communication was great, directions for arrival were spot on. To be nestled in such a charming neighborhood is the best way to travel and get the feel of things. Good info was provided on the history of Madison Heights and we enjoyed walking the area. The rose covered trellis and side yard were really delightful!! The kitchen was very functional and eating area felt like we were in our own little cottage surrounded by orange trees and bougainvillea. Oh, not to forget the amazing stash of books which were abundant for reading or just glancing through. Hope to be back again sometime!",location

"This was our third or fourth stay in Philip's charming cottage. We love it, and it just gets better and better (e.g., much improved Internet this time - thank you, Philip!). So many kind touches (eggs, half & half, fresh coffee, etc.), plenty of towels, great bedding for varied temperatures, excellent a/c,... but most of all, a welcome home away from home. We hope to return!",clean
Charming area and nice studio.  ,location
Nice house. Great location,location
"This place was perfect for our group of 10+ ladies! Very cute and fully equipped with basic house necessities plus a lot of extra blankets and pillows. The enclosed patio is a great touch. <br/><br/>When I arrived, I felt welcomed since all the lights were on, AC was blasting, and music was playing on the TV. My friends and I spent the day decorating, cooking, and preparing for our bachelorette slumber party.  I had brought items from home in case the house didn't have them, but it had it all! We were able to find things we needed throughout the house. <br/><br/>Minor things (not deal breakers): <br/>- House has 1 round dining table in the patio and 1 round coffee table (I had to bring tables from home due to our event)<br/>- Parking wasn't the best (2 spots in drive way, rest is street parking. Most guests parked within 2 blocks)<br/>- Garbage disposal wasn't working (due to not being used often)<br/><br/>I did discuss the tables and parking with Joshua, so I knowingly proceeded with no regrets. <br/><br/>Speaking of Joshua, he was great host to communicate with and got back to any inquiries quickly. The listing states no parties, but I asked if our shindig was okay with him since we were mostly staying inside. He said it was no problem! He was also very accommodating with check in/out times and assured me he was readily available if I were to have any issues at the house (which I didn't). <br/><br/>If I had to stay in the area again, I would definitely go back! :)",host

We booked a last minute stay . But honestly this was not the best experience. We checked in late because host didnât see our booking. He took very long to respond. The homes TVs didnât work . We tried to check out a bit later but no response and the cleaning person came at 10am sharp. A bit pricey for what you get check in at 4pm and check out at 10am,location
"Joshua's place is quite large and accurately described in the description by both him and other guest's experiences. It is conveniently located near Koreatown and has access to the Metro which is a huge plus. This place is definitely not for people who are afraid of bugs as there were a significant amount of flies and mosquitos, most of which never came back after killing them all on our following nights. It makes me wonder if there hadn't been anyone at the place in a while. The place was mostly clean from the floors to the bathrooms to the bedding. However, we had some issues with the dishes not being completely clean as well as accidentally being cut by some glass that was hidden in a rug in the common area.",clean
"If you like cigarettes smell yes you can book this place place, little bit scary because there was bugs at the living room table. You at your own risk. Wonât ever stay there again. Host was good trying to febreeze  the whole house but that will not work if the curtains and the couch stinks like it.",clean
"The location of this place is awesome just a few blocks from Korea town and grocery store. Communication was quick and easy with the host. <br/><br/>The house is a bit rundown but expected due to an 100 year old home. Also, make sure you bring extra towels when you book for 10 or more. The house only supplied us with 6-7 towels.",location

"It was an okay stay but certainly not one of my best Airbnb experiences. The positive was the location. We contacted our host for late checkout options before we booked, and he agreed we checkout at 1pm for an extra payment. When we arrived at the time we had agreed to check in with our host though, the previous guests were still inside with their luggage open in the middle of the living room. I called the host to let him know, and when I mentioned we had to pay a late checkout fee yet we arrive to an already occupied place his response and tone got aggressive and said this is already cheap for this area. Well, we are not the ones who priced this place so I don't think that should be our concern. Besides, the WiFi description in his instructions didn't work, and we had to wait for a few hours until he responded with new description. The TV didn't turn on. And the house was really cold because the heaters were not sufficient for that space. Overall, for one night it was okay, but it could have certainly been better.",location
Great location within walking distance of Korea town. Host is very responsive and came over to help when WiFi and tv wasnât working. Great place for the value.,location
"Hello this is a great location. It is a nice neighborhood. We all felt safe. One of the best parts is the available parking spaces on the property. We used Uber to a few spots and it was very affordable and centrally located. The house has everything you need to cook a meal. All guest said the beds were comfortable. The towels were sufficient. The room heaters were a nice touch. We were a group of four adults. The things we all agreed on was that the sofa needs to be changed it had a broken armrest and a lump, dip and smoke smell and it seem to be the primary sitting area. I really think a comfy sofa would make a world of difference. We did not use the dining area that is in an enclosed screened patio area because it was too cold out, but I can see it being a nice area to eat in warmer months. The other thing was that none of the bedroom doors seemed to lock or we could not figure it out easily. I believe it was a great value and it served its purpose for a group of four. I feel the house could comfortably accommodate 6. Everything was found clean.",location
"It may not be what you expect when you realize there is no central heating and when you experience broken toilet, but for the cheap price, you get what you paid for. That includes âokayâ communication. When I first politely asked about an issue, I received a condescending reply followed by no response to it later. Little things like that may not matter to everyone, which is why I say itâs not bad considering the cheap price. Overall, it was alright. Couldâve paid fifty more for something better had I known.",price
House was not clean and donât recommend. There were cigarette buds and smell in house. We left the house immediately as hygiene was big concern for us with small children .,clean

Great place! The apartment is very clean and tidy.  There are two bathrooms so you only have to share with one other person. I never had any problems with the other tennants and everyone was very gracious of shared spaces. My favorite thing was the available parking spot on site.

Would recommend this to anybody I know traveling to that area.,clean
"Good stay in a safe location, but no A/C in the apartment just a fan . <br/>Thank you",clean
Cihan is very responsive and fixed anything that we need quickly. Great location and a parking spot!,location
"The best Airbnb Iâve stayed in! The other rooms were booked and they all did everything to make my stay pleasant. Cihan was amazing, available for anything I could have possibly needed and even showed me around the city so I knew where the close stores and food was. The home was unmatched and the entire place was spotless, with daily cleaning. Thanks so much again Cihan for allowing me to stay with you, while I explored this new city!",clean
Great comfortable stay,clean
"Very welcome, kept in touch with is to check on our arrival and if we needed anything. Accommodation was as we expected, perfect for our 2 night stay near LA. ",clean
"We really loved this place. The studio is exactelly like on the pictures. We crossed Ryan few times on the road and met him on the second day of our stay. He's really nice and helpful. The road to the place is a bit steep and curvy, but as swiss we're used to it. It's close to the beach (Malibu) but also to the city (Woodland Hills/Calabasas). Only negative point were, that we were woken up in the morning because the neighboor made some noise with the leaf blower but after closing the window it was better. ",location
"A very rustic setting about 20 minutes from Santa Monica. Be aware you will do some serious mountain driving to get here. The suite was lovely, clean and comfortable.- nice kitchen, bed, and bathroom, and great coffee. Ryan was a perfect host, always available but not intrusive.  We heard animals at night, owls and coyotes. Would love to return.",clean
"I spend eight days in Josh's house.<br/>Josh and friends were nice to me and they have helped me don't know anything about America adapt.<br/>Moreover Josh's a large circle of friends gave me an active lifestyle.<br/>Telling about the house, sunlight flooded into the house and a backyard made me feel peaceful.<br/>The time with this house, friends and Josh are good memory to me.",location
"Ryan's place was exactly as advertised.  Very clean and modern, and in a great neighborhood with beautiful views.  We were only there for two short days for a wedding but we loved the quiet location, checking in and out was super easy and it had everything we needed.  Would definitely recommend to anyone traveling to LA who prefers a quieter getaway without being too far from the city.  ",clean
"Ryan's place was great! It's exactly how is looks on the pictures and has great amenities including beach towels, which was great as the beach is a 10 minute drive away!<br/><br/>Although we didn't meet Ryan he was great to communicate with and we took advantage of his list of restaurants he left in the room. Really helpful! <br/><br/>The only thing we would say is that you definitely need to have a car if you're staying here. Other than that it's a fab place :)",location
"And there was  music. Easy reachable on the television: I like that. You can make dinner: everything was there, nice shower, lovely sit outside. Neighborhood is interesting but complicated to reach. Ryan was good in contact. Friendly guy. Tip: a new matras. ",clean
"This was a great studio for the last leg of our southern CA vacation! It was clean, spacious, well decorated, the tv had tons of stations and the internet was great... and the temperature was perfect inside! It was way up in the hills of Topanga, but we loved feeling like we lived there. <br/><br/>We didn't really see Ryan or his family which made it very private as well. Ryan was very nice when we met him the first day, offered us beer and had wine and ice cold water bottles in the mini fridge when we arrived. <br/><br/>We showed up about 1.5 hours early, Ryan was so gracious about it and got the suite ready in under an hour. That's above and beyond some hosts.<br/><br/>Thank you Ryan and your fam for making us feel at home in Topanga! <br/>",location
"Where do I begin... <br/><br/>I don't know how I got so lucky and ended up in this lovely house with such amazing people. Let me start by saying Josh and his partner Ken are extremely sweet and welcoming. I needed to stay at their house for a night because my apartment in Hollywood was being painted. The booking was very last minute and yet they were still very accommodating. I have a little yorkie, who they welcomed with open arms. There was lots of outdoor space for her to run around in their backyard. (And believe me, if you are someone with a dog there are VERY FEW houses that actually allow them) All in all the house was very nice, clean and comfortable. <br/><br/>On top of the very comfortable stay...I had so much fun, I didn't want to go back home the next morning! I rented the couch, which I know seems like it could be uncomfortable or weird but it really just felt like I was sleeping on my best friend's couch after the way they treated me last night. Josh cooked a really nice meal (don't know if he always does that but still!!) and we all sat around the table (josh, ken and the other hous guests) and just had a ball. We played a fun game called 5 Seconds. Lots of fun and laughter. <br/><br/>I'm trying to keep this short, but it is hard because there's so many great things to say! I would definitely recommend this house...considering renting again just to get another one of Josh's amazing meals!",location
"Ryan was wonderful! The place was SUPER close to the wedding venue we were visiting & Ryan was really helpful in letting us know that! The place felt perfect for my boyfriend and I - secluded and a pretty drive to get there. Definitely great for a cozy, clean, secluded stay in Topanga! There were even beach towels left at our door for us to use during our visit! Close to the sweet Toping Canyon town for coffees and little shopping!",location
"Great little studio on a windy, hilly road in Topanga. Ryan was very accommodating and easy going. The pictures accurately reflect the space, which was perfect and clean. We arrived late after a cross country flight and the road was definitely tricky, but Ryan gave us great directions. Our only complaint was noise from the host family, who lives upstairs, and the landscapers who arrived to mow, etc one morning. We were on a kid-free vacation and would have wanted a little more quiet. We'd definitely stay there again!",clean
Great location and nice place. We are very happy with the place and the host.,location
Great value and super location. I stayed with 6 of my friends and the beds are nice and roomy even with 2 to a bed. We loved our stay and enjoyed a movie on their Apple TV!,price
Great place! Location is key,location
Large home with plenty of beds for everyone. Thanks again for hosting,location
Very accomodating and helpful!<br/>Area is perfect for a city vacation. Close shopping and transport options.,location
Joshâs place was nice and chill. Would definitely book it again in the future.,location
A good budget B&B option in the city. An old house close to Koreatown.,location
"When we got to the place the toilet seat/toilet was broken. The water for the big shower was reversed, the pressure of the water was barley there. Another thing is in the other small restroom the shower took a really long time to get hot. Also, the floor was really dirty. But overall, the host had fast communication and let us stay for a hour longer. The house is in a good location.",clean
This space is lovely with the patio and lots of room for guests with two bathrooms<br/><br/>would definitely stay there again,location
"My stay with Josh was great. He was extremely accommodating towards my cat and I. The BNb was in a central location and made apartment hunting very convenient. Everyone there provided a warm and welcoming atmosphere, just watch out for Josh's coffee - it's very strong. ",location
"Josh responded quicklyou and went above and beyond in terms of accommodating my situation.  The place was just as described, and my stay was extraordinary pleasant.  Location fantastic as well.  Price is a ridiculously good value and I cant imagine staying in a crappy hotel nearby for 4x the price.  I can't recommend this host and this place enough.  To be honest, I almost didn't want to write such a truthful, glowing review, because I'm afraid it will be booked solid next time I'm in town! ",location
Josh and the other longer-term residents were all very accomodating and friendly and I settled in in no time! The rooms were spacious and very comfortable. Josh suggested a few cool places to check out in the area and offered to take me out too! It was super close to transportation and shops. Taco night will always be remembered (: wish I had time to stay a little longer!,location
My first time in big city LA coming from a small town in Canada. The house was exactly as advertised clean safe convenient and very centrally located. Josh was not just a great host but turned out to be a great friend. My only recommendation would be to come hungry because he will try to feed you. Thank you for an amazing experience,clean
"When I arrived, Josh made me feel very welcome. He gave me a tour of the place and introduced to to everyone. He told what's around to do and where to go. I was in and out of the place a lot, so a lot of my time wasn't spent at the apartment, but my time spent there as always catching up with Josh, and Josh asking me if I needed anything. Overall, my experience with Josh was a positive one.",clean
"This place definitely met our expectations, its a old building, but they have done a good job making it comfortable and clean.",clean
"Very nice clean place, conveniently located, and Joshua what is easy to reach and talk to about my stay",clean
Everything was perfect!,clean
"Ryan's place was perfect for what we wanted. Super clean (this was the original selling point for me), quiet, very modern and comfortable feel to the place, and he provided us with very easy to follow directions. The place is high up in the mountains and driving up was pretty terrifying for me at first, but we got used to of it very quickly. <br/><br/>The place is very close to Santa Monica and Malibu. As a tip for anyone looking for a cool place nearby, at the bottom of the mountain right on the PCH there's a wine bar called Rosenthal Wine & Patio. Great place and great wine. It's right across from the ocean too.<br/><br/>Overall, I highly recommend Ryan's place if you're looking for a comfortable place to stay that isn't right in the city but still close enough. ",clean
"Everything was as expected and terrific. A clean, quiet retreat in a beautiful area. We enjoyed a long walk/hike in Topanga State Park as well as easy access to Santa Monica (and even used the Metro Expo line). The road was a bit narrow as well as twisty, enough so that we exchanged our rental SUV for a compact to feel more comfortable with it. But the locals  seem fine with it. We saw Ryan only briefly but that was fine as communication was easy. My husband knows LA well and was surprised at what a different take on it staying here gave him.<br/>",location
Josh is a great host and very friendly and it was a huge plus to have gated parking!<br/><br/>And his 2 dogs are wonderful!,host
It was my second stay at Ryans place and it just perfect. 10/10 ,location
Immaculate! A great place to get away from the city madness but still close to everything. We saw coyotes and heard lots of owls and crickets at night. The studio had everything we needed and the WiFi signal was fast and strong. The drive from Topanga into Malibu is beautiful. ,location
This was our very first Air B&B experience and it was fantastic. Ryan's home was beautiful and very private and clean. The bed was wonderful and the kitchen area had everything we needed.  We wanted to be away from Malibu but close to major access roads and his home provided that. Ryan also has a pamphlet in the apartment with great feedback on local restaurants and what to do and see.  He was super accommodating and was always prompt to reply on any questions I had.  Highly recommend and he is blessed to have a home in such a great area. Loved the musical decor too!  Kudos and thank you! ,clean
"Ryan was so helpful and put me at ease immediately. He helped me find the house and after I had found it, made sure I was comfortable and everything was there I needed. He remained available for assistance throughout my stay, even driving me to me location one time when I got lost and couldn't find it. I could not more highly recommend this location, it is beautiful, quiet, and if you have questions or need help Ryan makes himself available. This is a great place and I hope to stay again!",location
"Beautiful area, a great location for getting away from it all.  Great for drives and doing a loop cruise through the canyons.  Still close enough to the ocean and we appreciated the couple options for routes to LA to help avoid traffic.  Ryan was a great host and checked in with us daily via msg. We didn't see him or his family during our visit.  This worked out great as a crash pad as we were constantly on the go during the day starting early in the morning.  Great coffee and breakfast at Topanga Living Cafe!",location
A very relaxing location. Great place to stay while visiting LA if you're looking for some peace and quiet at the end of your days. Great hiking nearby. Clean and modern space perfect for one person or a couple. Lots of privacy but Ryan was always available for questions when needed. ,location
"We didn't meet Ryan unfortunately but his apartment is lovely, well-decorated. We had all we needed and Ryan answers quickly if you need something. ",clean
"Place was exactly as described!  Convenient, clean, and Josh is a great host.  Great Wifi too, and Paris Baguette was a wonderful recommendation from Josh.",clean
Josh was very helpful and attentive.We had a pleasant experience. ,clean

Ryan's place was exactly as advertised. Just what I needed as a solo traveller. Peace and quiet and in the mountains. ,location
"This place is modern, clean, well equipped and a great location near Malibu. The host is really nice and has info in the rental unit about local spots that is very helpful.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. ",clean
"Ryan was a wonderful host. The apartment was great and the location is ideal for enjoying the outdoors. The nearby Santa Monica mountains provided us with great hiking and cycling.<br/><br/>Daily we made the commute to either downtown LA, Santa Monica or Beverly Hills without any trouble. If you're looking for nightlife, there are plenty of options for dining and drinks within a half hour. <br/><br/>In all, I'd highly recommend the location for anyone looking for a quieter stay with proximity to outdoor destinations.",location
"Ryan was a lovely host. He helped us find the place on the phone, as we got lost in the hills. <br/>The studio apartment is situated in a beautiful area, it's very quiet and peaceful. The apartment itself was super cosy, very well decorated, and even though it was small it had all the facilities one needs.<br/>We enjoyed our stay and would defo recommend staying there if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of LA.",location
"Ryan's place is comfortable and beautiful! Check in was easy. AT&T users note there is no reception in the room, but sprint was fine. I would absolutely stay here again!",clean
Josh is a great guy. Our stay at the studio was wonderful and it felt like we were at home. Josh greeted us with open arms and it made us feel comfortable. This one might stay was well needed becuase we would of been homeless that night. At night we were all in the house chatting and his fiancÃ© played the piano and sang a beautiful tune. We definitely will be reaching out to stay with josh again. ,host
Josh was a welcoming host with a very kind and hospitable personality. The studio was comfortable and was accurately depicted in the description. The neighbors were friendly and the area was safe as well. ,clean
"Simply put, this place is exactly as it is in the pictures if not better. The drive is nice and scenic. Topanga is beautiful! Great, clean and affordable studio. ",clean
"Ryan is awesome and super helpful, the place is exactly as pictured and the location is perfect, I highly recommend and would stay here again without hesitation ",location
"If you're reading this review, you should probably look no further. If you're fine with a ten minute drive from the beach up into a canyon with winding roads at times, this is a great spot. Communication was spot on. Check-in couldn't have been easier. The parking was right in the driveway. Most importantly, the apartment was clean and just as pictured and the bed was quite comfortable. The location was also very convenient as we were able to get to Santa Monica and other parts of LA in 20 mins. I would highly recommend staying at Ryan's. ",clean
Great communication and great place to stay,location
"Amazing place, host and area. If you think of going to LA and planning to do sightseeing, Josh's place would be the best option for you. You'll have access to various places within at most 30min drive. Hollywood, hiking on hill, Long beach, Getty museum or whatever. Josh is a very outgoing person and I'm pretty sure he'll make your experience in LA very comfortable. ",location
It is a beautiful old house which has many beautiful plants. The parking is convenient. The shower made me headache for a while. A good place to travel with your family and your friends who are closed to each other. Jason is kind and very helpful to answer questions.,location
"Cute place to stay, and close to everything.",location
"This Airbnb is clean and very well maintained. We loved the location, even during the worst winter storm to hit SoCal in years. Know before you go that Topanga isn't tame - there are no streetlights, winding/tight canyon roads, and very little cell reception. <br/><br/>However, this apartment is definitely worth expanding your comfort zone. There is fantastic wi-fi, and we could have gone the entire trip without ever meeting Ryan or his wife if we so chose (this is a bonus for me, but the few times we did run into them they were lovely and very considerate). We will be back again! 5 stars for sure.",clean
"This is a great place to stay for a weekend getaway! Though the drive up is quite steep and windy, the views make it completely worth it. Itâs hard to believe that such a quiet and scenic woody area is so close to Malibu and Santa Monica. The place was very clean and well-furnished, which made for a comfortable stay. Keep in mind if you want to cook there, that there is no stove/oven, but there is a portable induction stovetop, which works just as well (itâs just that there is only one). All in all, I highly recommend this place! Clean, clear instructions and communication, beautiful place.",location
"Fantastic studio, perfect for business travel or personal getaway. Considerate and accommodating hosts, great conditions, awesome value.",location
"Very quaint and cozy get away in a hilly region. Not very easy to get to, but the host and space make the stay very comfortable and worth it ",location
"We absolutely loved how comfortable the suite was at Ryan's place. Everything was updated, clean, and accommodating. Couldn't have asked for more out of the amenities of the place. If you plan to sleep normal 11-7 hours at night, it is peaceful and quiet. Otherwise footsteps or music from the house above may keep you awake!  The location was a beautiful setting, you definitely need a car, and willingness to drive up some winding roads and high elevations. Overall very satisfied with our stay and would recommend to others!! ",clean
Ryan is a fantastic host and will go out of his way to make sure that guests are comfortable. The studio is secluded and truly feels like an oasis in the middle of the mountains. We arrived to find the place absolutely spotless and tastefully decorated. My boyfriend and I would definitely stay here again!,clean
Comfortable little stay would highly recommend if you're wanting to stay out the hustle of la.Easy check in and check out all the essentials (pots/pans/portable stove/hairdryer are supplied) <br/> Short 30-40 min drive to Santa Monica. <br/>Lovely little stay ,location
"Super friendly and attentive host, highly recommend to stay. Has all the accommodations to living at your very own home. Very narrow streets given you are up in the mountains and the places to eat around here are well hidden mom and pop shops. Very close to Topanga beach which is absolutely perfect. ð",location
"Ryan's place is clean, comfortable, and quiet. Communication is great also! By far the best place we have ever stayed in Topanga! ",clean
Awesome experience! Will return!,clean
Ryan is a responsive and hospitable host! The apartment is cleanly designed and comfortable.,clean
"Ryan's place is cool, beyond the really nice cross breeze in the unit (I'm so sorry for that horrible pun). <br/><br/>First things first: the bed is super comfortable. Like, ""Don't want to get out of bed because you're so comfortable"" comfortable. <br/><br/>Ryan has done a really nice job of taking a space that he honestly could have just slapped together, and instead making it feel more like a home than a place to crash at the end of the day.<br/><br/>As far as location, if you're looking for a quiet stay, this is your place. You're about a 10-15 minute drive to the PCH (depending on how adventurous you feel driving in the hills) and a short 5 minute drive to the heart of Topanga, where you'll find independently owned shops and restaurants. <br/><br/>All in all, I'd definitely recommend staying at Ryan's place if Topanga suits your traveling needs, as it did mine. ",location
"Stop searching and book this place! The unit is clean, modern, and very comfortable. The neighbourhood is beautiful and surrounded by nature, epic drives, and best of all silence. After spending days in Santa Monica and Venice, we much preferred the pace up in Topanga. There's some great little places to eat close by and general stores etc. for everything in between. Communication with Ryan was great and our privacy was respected. Will definitely return!",clean
"Ryan's place was amazing! It was quiet and remote. Which was just what we needed after spending a full day in LA (especially traffic). The suite is basically on a hill. The roads wind up with great scenic views! The value is amazing for the location. It's near the beach, hiking trails, and Santa Monica. Ryan was accommodating and easy to communicate with. I would definitely stay here again! Thanks again  Ryan!!",location
Extremely clean and cozy. Private as well. Would definitely recommend staying here and I would gladly go back again. ,clean

"Perfect place for a couples getaway! Ryan was extremely welcoming and friendly. The place was very clean, looks exactly like the pictures, and included many amenities. My girlfriend and I had a great stay. I would recommend staying here to anyone!",clean
 Oasis near the beach is a very accurate description! I would add that if you're visiting surrounding Los Angeles/Hollywood/Beverly Hills area it is a quiet retreat in a beautiful location as well! Ryan  is a terrific host and the place is awesome! ,location
"We really enjoyed our stay here! First off, while the unit is tiny, this was the only Airbnb I've ever stayed at that's actually a little -bigger- than it seemed in its listing.  There's also a cute little patio area for your use that I don't think is pictured/mentioned in the listing and was a nice surprise. Check in was very easy, and Ryan gave super clear directions about how to navigate what would've been a really confusing area.   Even though it's tucked away in the hills, I was also  pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to get picked up or dropped off by a Lyft driver. We had a few very minor complaints (there's no temperature control or fan, and very rarely you could hear kids running around upstairs), but my one major complaint is that the blinds are nearly transparent, meaning anyone going to the front door of the main house can likely see you, especially if it's evening and you have interior lights on. None of these things bothered us too much, but if we had felt the need to bring something up, I got the impression that Ryan was very available by phone to handle any issues. ",location
Stay with Ryan if you are in the Topanga area! His place is in a great location for either a mountain hike or a short trip to the beach for surfing! ,location
Up an amazing winding road you'll find a gorgeous self contained apartment in the beautiful Topanga Hills. We stayed here for three nights and loved it! Ryan was easy to get hold of to answer questions and made us feel very welcome. I would defiantly recommend his place and if we come back to L.A. we'd stay here again! A hidden gem!,location
"We had a great time at Ryan's.  The space was clean and well decorated.  The views from the mountain road were beautiful, and the home is located in a great spot to explore all of our favorite parts of Southern California.  We would definitely stay here again.",location
Ryan's place is the perfect get-away for two people like us looking for a secluded spot up in Topanga with easy access to Malibu. Great guy. Adorable family. We can hardly wait to get back. ,location

"Our stay at Josh's place was simply phenomenal and I would definitely recommend staying there.  Josh was very welcoming and responsive during the entire duration of our stay and I could have asked for nothing more from him. We were there on New Years Eve and he had organized a small celebration for his guests, where we met a bunch of cool people and got to know the other AirBnB'ers. Really made us feel welcome. His place is also at a great location, with a grocery store and other amenities just a short walking distance away in a safe neighborhood. We also got to play with his two beautiful and incredibly well-trained Australian Shepards. One of the best AirBnB's i have stayed at for sure",location
Super clean. Super cozy. Good location. Easy communication with the host. I would recommend this place for sure. ,clean
"Our stay here was short but sweet indeed! My two friends and I made a last minute decision to stay near West Hollywood for the night and Josh was a huge help. He responded immediately, even as late as it was. Very clean and cozy. The neighbors and other guests were friendly, but we still had plenty of privacy. We wouldn't think twice about coming back to stay here again!",clean

Josh and the place was amazing and welcoming. He even moved the cars for us so that we wouldn't get a ticket when we parked on the street. Very comfortable place and area! Will be back soon!,location
"Can I be a permanent roommate in the guest house V(^_^)v. ??? This was my first time booking an air BnB and it was so awesome.  Being Korean it was right in Koreatown and their garage is gated so that's a plus, worrying about parking in LA is such a pain and something I'd rather not fickle about when I'm supposed to enjoy the city.  Josh is so sweet, after we moved our suitcases in he knocked and offered us ripe fruit growing from his trees. My family was here to eat Korean BBQ and to go to universal and see the Hollywood walk of fame, we had 5 people and there was plenty room.  Everything is wood and and very clean~  All are very close, we ubered to Hollywood walk of fame (josh told us there is limited parking) it was a cheap ride and about a 15 min drive to universal.  We were in a private and separated guest house and my parents enjoyed that, but I realized that josh and his other roommates in the main house were a group of the nicest chinchillas ever.  Could talk story with them well into the morning.  Only wish I had more time, got a feeling I will be back though ",location
"As a first time airbnb user, Josh made everything easy, he was an amazing host.  The place was as described and very spacious.  He also had parking available for us in his driveway, which was great because parking on the street looked to be a nightmare.

"Josh was very accommodating. We only stayed one night, but it was a great experience. We needed a room on short notice, and Josh was able to provide a place for my family and our dog. It was a clean and very welcoming space. His house was exactly what we needed for our stay. We will stay with Josh again. Thanks again Josh!",clean
Josh was the friendliness HOST I had ever met. The only thing I like about this place was the location. It was near to every tourist attraction places. ,location
"First off, the unit was exactly as described. I stayed here with 4 friends and had everything we needed. The unit is small but does reflect the price you're paying for and it was perfect for us since we just needed a place to rest and relax in between our trips out to the city. There's also a small courtyard outside for hanging out and playing with his two awesome dogs!<br/><br/>Location was perfect too near the restaurants and bars.<br/><br/>Josh was also an amazing host. He knew the city very well and offered us a lot of tips on where to eat. Best host I've had so far. I will definitely stay here again next time I stay in LA.",location
"Our stay with at Josh's place was awesome. Josh was very accommodating and made sure we had everything we needed to settle in. He was available whenever we needed him and was easily accessible through text/calls. Being able to park on the property was great because we didn't have to worry about finding street parking. My only gripe was that it was tandem parking - but this was only very minor. As for the place itself, it was a nice studio with plenty of space to sleep (2 beds and a couch). It was also convenient to have a kitchen. <br/><br/>Definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in LA =) ",location
Great communication and location. Will definitely book again in the future!!,location
Loved this place! Any issues we had were quickly solved and the hosts were more than pleasant! Definitely reccommend!,clean
"communication was great, area also. pretty accurate with the listing we got. thank you!!!!",location
"Josh was such a great host. I generally don't feel comfortable around new people, but Josh made us feel like we were visiting old friends. The vibe of the entire property was very friendly and inviting. The room was exactly as described and suit our needs perfectly. There are a few other rooms on the property with outdoor common areas and shared laundry.  Parking is off street, gated, and shared with other guests. We plan on staying here during our next trip to Los Angeles. ",clean
"From the second my friends and I arrived we knew we were going to really enjoy where we were staying. Josh welcomed us with his hilarious sense of humor and made us feel right at home, gave us recommendations on places to go,eat, etc. Our guest house was very clean and had lots of closet space for all of our luggage. Josh also invited us out to some of the popular local bars with him, his fiancee and his friends. It was the best night of our whole trip. Staying there made our trip to LA so much more enjoyable and we will be coming back again! We couldn't thank Josh enough for his hospitality and for being such a great host!",clean
"Josh was a stellar host! He was extremely upbeat and informative. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, especially a younger group. The area is central to everything necessary to see in LA and Josh is full of recommendations as well. Overall, a hell yes to Josh and his home!",location
"Although we stayed only one nights at Josh's place, we were so happy with a very warm welcome from Josh. Our kids really love his dog Rome ""Mom"" and talked about him days after. Josh's place is close to everything in Los Angeles (Santa Monica beach, Bevery hills, Hollywood Walk of Fame...)",location
Great experience. Will recommend Josh to anyone needing a nice place to stay,location
Josh was an amazing host. He was always helpful if we needed anything such as any cooking or living essentials. There were about 5-6 of us staying there and it was very comfortable for a quick trip. And parking is amazing too! That is super hard to find in LA. I recommend to stay with Josh 100%. And I cant wait to come down and stay with him again! ,host
"I got lucky enough to book Josh's place on a spontaneous last minute trip to LA. Only stayed 1 night, but Josh is great. Super chill guy. Great location. Very clean space. Definitely top on my list when I'm in the area again!",clean

Great food all around, with lots to do.<br/> <br/>Jenny was on time, and helpful when we arrived. <br/> <br/>Overall - this was a great experience!",location
A wonderful home with amazing hosts! This was our first airbnb experience and the bar has been set high. The home is perfect...4 levels. The rooftop is the icing on the cake with jacuzzi and firepit. Kitchen is newly renovated (not same as pictures). Jenny and Tom were easy to reach and prompt to respond when we booked and while we stayed there.  Jenny provided us with places to eat and even suggested things for us to do with our kids.  They had two bikes that came in very handy. Home was clean and had lots of natural light.  Location is (Website hidden by Airbnb) block from Abbott Kinney and two blocks from beach.  My husband wanted to extend check out by an hour and Jenny offered for us to stay til evening since no one was checking in after us!  The home and hosts made it the perfect vacation for our family.,location

Cosy and nearby!<br/>We had a one night stay and it was really good!<br/>Everything is just as you can see on the picture. <br/>I loved the little terrace!,location
"Josh is great host texting us in advance to arrange arrival time. Gave us great suggestions on local restaurants. Local is very convenient, right in K-town so a lot of great restaurants for BBQ and Tofu hours. The Grove is 10 minutes driving for those want to shop. The place is as described, clean and spacious. My two sons had a great time playing with Josh's two lovely dogs. ",clean
"Josh was a very helpful, we were ending our trip to the US by revisiting LA and he made the effort of welcoming us as we checked in and telling us about all the cool spots in the city (and getting us guestlist entry!) The listing itself got a bit cramped with six people, but we had a great time. Josh is super easy-going and makes the effort to help out with any queries we may have. A really good stay.",location
Josh was a great host. The guest house was cozy. The location was close to everything. So it was very convenient. We uber or walked to our destination. Great stay. Thanks Josh!! ,location

"This place is great! The guest house is roomy, secure, and has everything you'd need. The private parking is a big plus! Also, Josh is super responsive and was there to greet us. He answered all of our questions and gave us awesome recommendations to eat and drink in the area. Would definitely stay here again. ",location
"I moved to LA for business about a month ago. This was my first time ever coming to the west coast and I did not know a single person. <br/>Josh was by far the most incredible host I have ever had. I stayed in the guest house for 30 days, and I can't describe how blessed I was to have met him and the other house guests. <br/>Within 1 week of being here, I already had a fantastic group of friends who helped show and guide me through some of the coolest parts of Los Angeles.<br/>As per the house itself; stunning. <br/>The kitchen was beautiful and had every necessity. The bathroom was clean and pristine. The shower/tub combo was spacious and the water pressure was fantastic. <br/>The living room had an extremely comfy couch matched with an awesome TV connected with Netflix and Hulu. <br/>The front porch was clean and cozy. Not to mention if you look straight ahead from the drive way, you get a glorious view of the sunset. <br/>As the details had said, there was very ample parking. Never had to worry about finding street parking. <br/>All in all, I am forever grateful for the graciousness and hospitality that Josh and his friends provided for me. Nothing was more satisfying than coming home to a clean house, a comfy bed, and a quiet/safe neighborhood. <br/>",host
"Great location, quiet neighborhood near great entertainment and food. Josh was an awesome host, easy to communicate with and very welcoming. ",location
"Josh was a fantastic host . He was able to respond to questions and comments on a timely matter prior to and during our stay. He provided us with recommendations to fun local establishments that aren't well known to visitors.The house was well kept and clean, and had parking spots which are hard to find in the Los Angeles area . I would recommend staying here and any of Josh's rentals !",clean
"Absolutely loved Josh's place! Best AirBnb we've ever stayed at. Josh and my husband basically became best friends, and I now have to buy my son a dog because of how much fun he had with Josh's Husky. The space was even better than in the pictures. The best Cali vibes. The space was super functional and comfortable. Use of the brand new washer and dryer was a huge plus! Great location in Koreatown. Wish we could've stayed longer!",location
"Josh is a really cool guy. I came to the Airbnb pretty late at night, and thought it would be awkward. However, Josh was very welcoming and there was zero-awkwardness. He has great suggestions on restaurants, local bars, and etc. The place is decent and the location is even better. Overall, I definitely recommend this place to anyone. ",clean
Josh's place is conveniently placed and provided a good sleeping situation. Josh's hospitality was on point and I will be back when I come back down to So-Cal!,location
Josh is a great host! Very hospitable and friendly. Would definitely recommend.,clean
"Josh was very nice and helpful. We needed early check in and Josh was able to work with us to make that happen! The room was what we expected, a little crowded with six people (two on air mattress) but it definitely worked for one night. There was a nice little outside area with chairs too. <br/>The street was nice and quiet and a close ride to usc. Grocery store five minute walk away. ",location
The host friendly and relaxed.,clean
"Had an incredible stay at this beautiful, relaxing, and very private Venice gem of a find! Jenny was always available and helpful, although not much help was needed. Everything was set up to feel like home! It's perfectly placed blocks from the beach, and restaurants. I know I'll be returning! ",location
Jenny was welcoming and available.,clean
"This place is amazing! 1 block from Venice Beach, a few blocks from all of the shops on AK, a 10-minute walk to all of the great restaurants on Main St., a 10-minute walk to a great local health food store (or a 10-minute bike ride to Whole Foods if you are into chains), and a garage if you have a car.  The rooftop deck has a dining table, daybed, umbrella, fireplace, hot tub, and some truly beautiful vegetation--it's huge!  We tried to spend as much time as possible on the roof which has views of the ocean, LA, and the mountains.<br/><br/>Inside, it's full of natural light and everything you need for dining, entertaining, and relaxing.  <br/><br/>Jenny and Tom are extremely warm and gracious.  We will definitely stay here the next time we are back in LA.",location
Josh's location was perfect for me and my friends.  It was close to a bunch of restaurants in K-Town and the private parking was a huge plus. He always made sure we had everything we needed and was very accommodating to all of our requests. He also had the coolest dogs.   Our group would definitely book with him again next time we stay in LA!,location
walking distance to the metro rail and close to bars and resto. An Uber away to the Walk of Fame. Josh suggested some nice bars and Korean bbq place. will book this again next time,location
Josh was super friendly. Fast communication. He had a lot of recommendations for food. The place was clean and parking was easy. Definitely will use again. Highly recommend. ,clean
Great ! Fantastic  host <br/>We highly recommend this place !!!,location
"This is a great 4 storey house in a fantastic location. The house is well equipped with everything you would need and Jenny was the perfect host allowing us to use their bikes and boogie boards, which the kids loved. The house comes with a space in Jenny and Tom's garage, which is a must for such a central location, but what we loved most of all was the rooftop garden which was a lovely tranquil spot from which to watch the sunset, after a busy day sightseeing. We would definitely recommend this house.",location
"We stayed in the apartment for a week with a couple of friends. Jenny and Tom were great hosts! The apartment is clean, airy and bright. Garage space is very good. The apartment is close to main shopping streets and restaurants both in Venice and Santa Monica. We had 2 bikes for our use and that worked perfectly. There were also surfboards, which we did not use. Jenny and Tom have dogs, but they were really careful with leaving them inside. Bedrooms are in lower level and leaving room and kitchen in the upper level. Terrace was great for barbecue. There was only a small incident when one of the electrical fuses stopped working but it was repair the next morning. One thing that could be improved is wifi receptions in the bedrooms, which was intermittent. Other than that, we had a great time in a great place!",clean
"My family and I enjoyed our stay at Jenny's oasis. We know from past experience it can be very very warm this time of year so our desire was to find a quiet place with AC. Our search of this property indicated it had Air Conditioner, but I did not verify with Jenny and thus, when we arrived, we were quite surprised there was no AC.<br/>This was an issue for us but we made the best and lived like a native. The home is great , it's a great location and the rooftop lounging is so tranquil. Unfortunately our AC requirements will require us look elsewhere next season but if that's not an issue then we highly recommend Jenny's oasis.",location
"Our stay at Jenny's place was unfortunate. Not only did the listing promise air conditioning which in reality did not exist (a claim that I am happy to see she has since taken down), the house was also poorly maintained. Screws were loose and falling out in the spiral staircase (I tightened them - you're welcome, Jenny), some drawers were coming off the hinges, there were spiderwebs and sand in the bathroom. Lack of air conditioning is not usually a big problem in Venice, however both bedroom windows face a wall and a back alley and there is little to no breeze that comes through. Mosquitos do, however, as there are no screens on the windows, so prepare to be eaten alive. <br/>To be fair, the living room and (especially) the shared roof are quite nice, and so is having space in their garage as finding parking in Venice can be tricky. <br/>Jenny was nice enough to let us leave early as we were quite miserable at her place due to the lack of air conditioning and cool air. But I don't believe we will be back. <br/><br/>",clean
"The apartment was great looking, clean and spacious enough for our family of 4. The hosts were friendly and helpful. The garage space was a plus though it is a very tight space.<br/>The temperature was pretty high during our stay and the main living floor with the living room, dining room and kitchen was  consequently pretty warm. Fans in the bedrooms at night helped. The shared roof top area was very nice and the walk to the beach is short. ",clean
"We liked how clean, stylish and welcoming is the house. The hosts were so friendly.<br/>The location was so convenient. And the hot tub's view was extrodinary.",location
"Jenny and her place were absolutely WONDERFUL. 2 blocks from the beach. Right off Abbot Kinney. Beautiful, clean and fully stocked interior. And the roof. Amazing. Huge roof, view of the water and a great hot tub. I'll absolutely be staying here again next time I'm in LA. ",location
"We spent a great time in Venice and loved this vacation house so much. It's perfectly equipped and it was very clean. The rooftop garden is outstanding, especially with it's views, jacuzzi and bbq!!! It was also a big pleasure to use the beachcruisers and surfboard.<br/>We were happy about the short distances to the beach, Abbot Kinney Blvd and the Venice Ale House (our favorite restaurant / pub with awesome organic meals and craft beers).<br/>Jenny and Tom are absolutely great hosts. Everything worked out fine. Thank you so much for the great stay!!!",clean
"Couldn't ask for more. Host was awesome, House was amazing, View from the roof is bliss. Loved my trip and everything about it. Highly recommend if your looking for a slice of paradise. ",location
"Jenny and Tom were amazing hosts to say the least! This is by far the hands down the best vacation rental in Venice Beach. They treated us like family and we had access to their bikes, boogie boards and we felt as if we had our own private house, and honestly being a real estate agent, this is a multi-million dollar house with Modern finishes and a rooftop deck with Ocean Views; therefore to experience luxury beach living at an affordable price was absolutely amazing. Furthermore; It was by far one of the most relaxing and enjoyable experiences I have ever had and words cannot describe the serenity and calmness I felt after this life changing trip! Thanks to you both!

"We had a wonderful time at Tom's and Jenny's place. The place is spacious, the roof top wonderful and everything worked.<br/><br/>The place is very close to the beach, but still in a peaceful street so our child slept like children are supposed to do.<br/><br/>An extra plus for the garage space as the street didn't have so many parking spots.<br/><br/>I can only recommend the place!",location
We had a brilliant few days at in Jenny's apartment. The roof deck is stunning- spacious and relaxing with beautiful sunset views to enjoy whilst reclining in the hot tub! Jenny couldn't have been a better host. She was always on hand to answer queries and accommodate our changing schedule but really let us feel like the place was our own. A perfect stay.,location

"Josh was a great host (or the most laid back AirBnB host (Website hidden by Airbnb) he describes himself :)). The room was exactly as described, comfortable and equipped well enough to spend a night or two. Location is also solid, close enough to the major areas. <br/><br/>Plus, if you happen to be a dog owner/lover, bonus points for his awesome doggies! :)",clean

The place was very comfortable,  and was exactly as it was promoted. <br/><br/>Josh was a very friendly and helpful host,  and i would like to mention he is constantly upgrading the surroundings of the property to look even more welcoming and green. He gave us suggestions of restaurants and how and when to travel and not forgetting how he helped us print our boarding tickets.  <br/><br/>One small setback would be that the shower tub pipe got clogged on the final day, but Josh looked in to right away.

"This was my first airbnb experience and Josh made it a great one. I just left his place 2 hours ago and couldn't wait to write a review. First, about Josh. Hes a great host, super easy to communicate with and super laid back and down to earth. Makes you feel more than welcome and he is super helpful. Awesome guy overall. Now for the room. Its perfect. In a great central location in the city. Pretty much 30 min drive from anywhere and thats a plus in LA. Supermarkets are a 5 min walk as are restaurants. Comfy clean beds and good size room with tv, wifi, couch, fridge and stove. Also best part. PARKING IN A DRIVEWAY in the middle of the city. Thats so rare.  Perfect for a person, couple or family. I was there with my wife and 2 year old daughter and it was great. Bonus if you're there with kids, Josh is super nice with kids and has two beautiful friendly dogs who love kids. Thanks Josh. If im ever back in LA, i would not stay anywhere else. ",location
"Josh is an amazing host! We needed to check-in early and he was so accommodating. We only needed to stay one night, but we will definitely be staying at his place again next time we're in LA.

The roof top, fire pit and hot tub makes it a next level experience.

She was really sweet and made me feel at home straight away. They live in the other half of the duplex so if you ever need anything, they're on hand to help you out. The neighborhood is great and it's 5 mins to Abbott Kinney and 5 mins to the Beach. the rooftop was my favorite part about the property - the view of the sunsets was awesome! ",location
The whole stay was wonderful and Jennifer's family was very welcoming. Their home was in the perfect area - one block away from the beach and one block away from Abbot Kinney. We also enjoyed the rooftop immensely! <br/><br/>We will definitely try to book here the next time we're in Venice! Thanks so much Jennifer and Jessa!,location
"We stayed here with a party of four.  Everyone loved the place and said they would stay here again.  This was a good location in Venice, a block away from the beach, and within walking distance to mostly anything you would need.  <br/><br/>Jennifer was excellent in communicating during and after the booking process.  Jessa was present to host during our stay.  Our arriving flight was delayed coming in, so we arrived extremely late, but there was no issue as Jessa easily accommodated us for check-in.  While there, Jessa provided suggestions for food and drinks, which was very helpful.  There was also a binder with a information about the property and neighborhood, which was very helpful.<br/><br/>The living space was comfortable with good natural light and airflow.  The roof was very cool and wonderful for relaxing.  Having a garage was also a great benefit as we rented a car for our visit.<br/><br/>I would easily recommend this place for a group of 2-4.  <br/><br/>",location
"Our family had the most fantastic time staying at here.  The space is fantastic! Very, very comfortable for our family of 4 - would happily suit a larger family as well but a couple wouldn't be lost in the space either.  The space is set over 4 levels. Very discrete. Very groovy.<br/><br/>The location is great. Steps to the water, steps to Abbot Kinney (Salt and Straw ice cream - yum, amazing shopping!). The roof - we lived up there.  The view, the hot tub, the gas fire pit ... #relax <br/><br/>As good as all this is, the space is made even better by wonderful hosts.  Jen and Tom are discrete, and very friendly.

Everything was already clean, arranged when we arrived. He welcomed us at gate and gave a quick tour about his place. Ofcourse his dog is also great!

"This place is great! We stayed here for six nights at the end of a long and busy road trip.  It was just what we needed - somewhere like home to relax and chill out, as well as being able to easily explore all the local neighbourhoods.  It was extremely clean and tidy and has everything you need for a stay at the beach, and it really is just a block away. It is extremely spacious, light and airy with two large double bedrooms. Our kids had had enough of sharing a double bed throughout our holiday, not a problem - there is a good standard air bed for use as well. Body boards and a surf board are available for use, as well as two bikes (in fact Jennifer offered her own bike for our daughter as well, but it was too big).  The roof top terrace is the best - also really spacious and full of lovely plants (we were told we could help ourselves to the limes, chillies and herbs), which makes it a lovely place to relax - plenty of places to sit, or sunbathe.  For us it was great to be able to BBQ, go in the hot tub or sit by the fire pit whenever we wanted, the place is your own.  Jennifer and Tom are very friendly and accommodating, great hosts, happy to answer any queries you may have.  I highly recommend this place. Thanks Jen and Tom!",clean
"This is the best place to stay at in Venice, close to everything and Jennifer helped us with the checkin and gave us all details need and was very responsive to any of our requests. The place is amazing with the roof I would highly recommend this place. ",location
Great place. Great location. Nice people. Highly recommended. ,location
"We spent a weekend at Jen&Tom house and it was really nice.<br/>The house has a very nice style, clean and located in a great position.<br/>There is also a great rooftop where you can relax during the sunset and appreciate the Californian weather.<br/>We also had available two bikes that we used to go on beach track up to Santa Monica.<br/>This is a place that I suggest and I wouldn't think twice to go back there.<br/> ",location
"Nice place, great location, good hosts",location
Fantastic place. Fantastic people. We will definitely stay here every time we come to LA. Only a very short walk to the beach and right in the heart of Venice beach. A perfect spot to really LIVE Venice beach and Santa Monica ,location
"We have stayed 5 nights at Jennifer & Thomas house at the end of our holidays un California and it was perfect.<br/>A short walk from the beach and close to Abbot Kinney boulevard, location is unbeatable.<br/>The house itself is as described in the pictures, very tastefully appointed and spotlessly clean. <br/>Having access to the rooftop garden & hot tub was a must.<br/>Jennifer & Thomas have been really kind guests, making us feel at home.<br/>They were extremely quick to answer any question or concern & arranging during check-in / check-out process.<br/>I would highly recommend this place and / or return if i'm back to LA.",clean
We had an amazing time in the Appartement. Jen was a wonderful host. Everything was perfect. We'll be back.,clean
"Jennifer & Thomas where great hosts, their place is the best one we have stayed at in Venice.  this is the 10th time we stay.  We would do everything to stay there again :) <br/><br/>It is one of the best locations in Venice cause you can walk to the Venice boardwalk.  Walk to Abbot Kinney where all the nice cafes and restaurants are and it is a short walk to Main street shops.<br/><br/> <br/>",location
 Nice house very well located with everything you need. The roof top has an amazing view and it's really nice to be able to relax in the hot tub. Jennifer and Tom were kind and helpful. ,location
"Amazing location, beautiful apartment, friendly hosts. Garage, bicycles, the roof - all made this the perfect place to stay. Zero complaints except that we are not still there!",location
"Jennifer and Thomas couldn't be nicer. They offered help when necessary and gave us privacy. The home is well-equiped for intimate living and nice dinner parties. Plenty of cosy pillows and throws in living room and bedrooms. The kitchen is equipped for gourmet cooking. The rooftop succulent garden is impressive and so are the sunsets on view. Once outside, you have some of the best locales of SoCal. Loved celebrating our Christmas here with family!",location
"We stayed for a week with our new bby and loved it. The flat is neat as a pin, light and airy and thoughtfully decorated. Tom was fantastic, even meeting us without a complaint on New Year's Eve when our flight was delayed! The place is gorgeous and the roof terrace is literally to die for- a huge space with the hot tub and sweet and romantic with all the plants and flowers. The location is unbeatable, right next to the beach but quiet, and overall we were just so pleased. Even our newborn liked it...! Thank you Tom!",location
"We had such a great time staying at Jennifer and Tom's place! They are wonderful hosts: very responsive, accommodating, and helpful. When we arrived, Tom showed us around and explained everything about the place in great detail, which was very helpful. The place itself is spacious, clean, and neat. The rooftop is amazing, and the hot tub is very well-maintained and a pleasant, relaxing way to end a day (but ask Tom beforehand to show you where the spare key to the rooftop is so you don't accidentally lock yourself out lol). The location could not be any better! It is on a quiet street, only about a 5-min walk to the beach and a 5-min walk to Abbot Kinney, the main shopping and restaurant street in Venice. The proximity to everything enabled us to have a really cool village experience. We highly recommend this place and will definitely contact Tom to book it when we come back to Venice :)  ",clean

Beautiful place close to the water! Jennifer and Tom were amazing hosts and we will definitely return! ,location
We were fortunate to find this gem in Venice. We had a great stay and would recommend this to anyone visiting the area. The location was perfect! Would be happy to stay here again. ,location
We just returned from a wonderful stay at Tom and Jenny's. The place is beautiful and a great location between the beach and Abbott Kinney - both are about a block away. The neighborhood coffee truck was great (Neighborhood Bru) and located across the street. <br/><br/>The place itself was as described and has a fantastic rooftop you'll want to spend some time on. <br/><br/>We had our 6 month old with us and Tom and Jenny made sure the crib was ready to make her stay enjoyable as well. <br/><br/>Tom was great and all communications were answered promptly. Definitely recommend!,location
"In a word, the place is wonderful. The location is excellent with plenty of options for any possible need. The beach truly is steps away as is Abbot Kinney Blvd. and its myriad attractions. It's difficult to fathom a better location in Venice. Jen and Tom are exceptional hosts and it was delightful getting to know them. Accessing major thoroughfares (PCH and the 10) is easy to do. The kitchen is fully equipped and groceries at Whole Foods are just blocks away. I haven't slept that well in a long time nor found a more peaceful place to read and write. I will be back for sure. ",location
Jennifer and Thomas have a beautiful apartment one block from Venice Beach. It is exactly as depicted in the photographs. They are very friendly and hospital hosts and always there to help.<br/><br/>We had an amazing stay and would completely recommend this to anyone looking to enjoy a stay in Venice Beach and we would definitely return here if we go back to Venice Beach.<br/>,location
"Wonderful place, wonderful location, wonderful hosts. Hope to stay there again.",location
"The host is super kind and welcome us when we arrived. The location is great, walking distance to lots of korean resturant. The house is cozy. Just one thing is that the quilt is too thin for winter and the heater is too noisy. My parents can't sleep.",location
"I can't say enough good about this Airbnb. The room was clean and had anything and everything we could have needed. If there was anything else we needed Josh was more than happy to get it for us. But this experience wasn't just about the place. Josh was also incredible. He welcomed us with open arms, giving us a page full of great recommendations that we took full advantage of and loved every single one. He went above and beyond the role of a host and really made us feel at home and among friends. Our trip simply would not have been the same without Josh and his Airbnb. If you are thinking about staying here don't think twice, just book it. I guarantee you won't be disappointed.",clean

"Great place to stay in LA - located centrally, very close to the beach but also close to shops/restaurarants etc. Tom was a very nice host, responsive to our questions (we didn't have many because everything was clear). The house felt homy and my favorite part was the roof - wonderful to drink your coffee in the morning, sunbathe during the day or have a glass of wine before dinner! Recommend it!",location
"Tom and Jen's place is fantastic, and they couldn't have been better hosts.<br/>I highly recommend the house and look forward to stay there again in the future!",location

Enjoyed my stay at Josh's place. The studio was very clean and comfortable and we were able to park our car in the driveway. Josh was very responsive and made us feel welcomed. Highly recommended if you are in the Koreatown area !,clean
This place worked fine for our needs. Parking was a little difficult with our larger truck.,location
Josh was a fantastic and flexible host. His description is accurate and we enjoyed our stay. This place is in a decent neighborhood and we felt safe. We appreciated the gated parking as the street was quite crowded. Excellent location for a great value! I would stay here again.,location

Josh is so kind and the room was clean enough!,clean
"We stayed in the studio with 2 beds and a couch for my family of 4 plus my mother-in-law. Plenty of sleeping spots for all. There is a kitchen which I always love to have while traveling, even just to reheat or store leftovers. We utilized the mini fridge and microwave and some dishes, but there was a stove available too. Josh provided a heater and gated parking - both things I really appreciated! He responded quickly to concerns or questions I sent him through the messaging on the Air BnB app. The neighborhood was quiet and close to some good eats. I would easily recommend this place for a stay in LA. They do have a dog (or 2?) but I didn't hear or encounter them. My husband said he saw them outside in the morning but they didn't mind him being there.",location
"Josh is a great host, always available for any need. Location is great being walkable distance to koreatown eateries, but is still in a safe neighborhood. I couldn't see any street parking in my weekend stay, so off-street parking offered was a great plus.",location
"My family had a great time in this charming house. It is steps from the beach and boardwalk and the amazing shopping on Abbot Kinney. The house was definitely more charismatic than the pictures, we were pleasantly surprised. I have a 6 month old and it was the perfect house for our long trip. Thank you so much Tom and Jennifer for always being available with any questions we had. ",location
"My family and I had the best time at Tom and Jen's place. It really suited our needs perfectly. It is in a great location - close to the beach, close to the wonderful stores of Abbott Kinney and a short drive or bike ride from the amazing Wholefoods supermarket.

"Gorgeous house right in the middle of venice beach. The roof was an excellent way to wind down at night, and the house provided all the comforts. We loved our stay and would recommend it to others. <br/><br/>One thing to note, there is no Air Conditioning in the unit (that we could find!) This normally would not be a problem, but we visited during a heat wave (95+) so it was quite warm at night in the bedrooms. This was not a huge deal to us, but useful information if you are traveling with children or during the heat. There are several fans that help cool the room down.",location
Amazing place to stay! 1 block from the beach....super charming and the coolest rooftop!!!,location
"We had a great stay at Josh's place. It was a clean cozy room with privacy and security. Well located to lot of restaurents around. Room had all the kitchen amenities. And Josh was a humble and nice person, also available at all our needs. His place is highly recommended. Thanks Josh.",clean
"Awesome location in Koreatown. The place was very quiet in the back and perfect for a short trip. There were some issues with the DirecTV not working, but the wifi was stable and quick. ",location
"Joshua was really friendly and welcoming to us. The room is spacious and tidy but we did have a couple of minor issues. We didn't open any windows as there were no screens but there were still a lot of mosquitos and flies in the room. <br/><br/>We also found the room (which is a separate annexe) to be really cold at night despite trying to use the heater. Maybe some thicker blankets would be useful?<br/><br/>That said, we cannot fault Joshua for being welcoming and for his great advice on local bars/restaurants.",clean
"Joshua is a wonderful host, from the moment we arrived he made sure we got settled and had everything we needed, even offered to help unpack. The place is  perfectly sized and comfortably fit our family of 5. Best way to describe it is as a larger open studio, it has two comfortable beds, a couch, we used the air mattress, and the full kitchen came in handy in making meals. We will definitely book again in the future!",location
"Joshua's place was very centrally located, clean, comfortable and quiet. Although we didn't need it, having parking available is a great perk. ",clean
"This place really made our trip to LA excellent. It's a spacious studio, clean, with a small outdoor space as well. We were within walking distance to lots of shops and grocery stores, and we ordered tons of delivery food as well. The host, Josh, is a really wonderful person. He did everything he could to make our stay great, including letting our daughter play with his dog and bringing us fruit that grows on the trees! We felt very welcome and comfortable in asking for assistance with anything. ",clean

"Joshua's place was exactly what we were looking for! It's close to just about anything you'd want to do in Koreatown. We enjoyed the casual atmosphere. There were three of us and a dog and we were very comfortable in the room with a sofa and 2 beds. The outdoor area (a shared space) was a good place to relax during down time.  We missed meeting the host, but he communicated well via text.",location

"I recently stayed at Jen and Tom's place while travelling for work. The house was excellent, very clean and accurately described. It's in a great location; 20 minutes from LAX, close to the beach and all the shops/restaurants/bars of Abbot Kinney. They also have a great roof terrace, which is an excellent place to relax. I'd definitely go back either on work or holiday. Tom and Jen were very accommodating; Tom gave me a tour of the house and Jen was very responsive to messages.",clean
"We stayed in Tom's amazing house for 8 nights and had a fabulous home from home experience . The accommodation is beautifully presented to the highest of standards and immaculately clean. The roof terrace is stunning and a complete hit with the whole family. Tom is a very gracious host, easily contactable for any queries or to offer guidance on local services or best walks etc... Would thoroughly recommend this gem of a place to stay, which is only a skip & a hop to the beach, to anybody wanting to holiday in Venice beach or nearby  Santa Monica.",clean
"Itâs hard to imagine a much better set-up than this in Venice.  Directly between the beach and Abbot Kinney, itâs a great location yet a quiet house.  The inside is great, particularly the bright third floor living and dining room, and the great, large roof deck.  Hosts are very responsive and friendly without any suggestion of being overly present.  Would definitely return, and highly recommend the place.",location
A fantastic place. Do not hesitate to book. Rooftop is an amazing oasis. Lots of room. Clean. Perfect location. Canât be beat. Will stay again.,location

"Great place. The owners and caretakers were friendly, efficient, available, basically everything youâd want. The place is in a great location and the roof deck really made it. Close to Abbott Kinney and all the shops and restaurants. Also really close to the beach. You canât go wrong!",location
"Tom and Jen's place is really lovely -- exactly as described and the perfect location for the beach, walking to Abbot Kinney or going to spend time in Santa Monica, Venice, Marina Del Rey, etc.  Definitely be sure to head to Tom's restaurants in Venice!<br/><br/>Check-in and out was very easy, and Tom was incredibly responsive. The house is part of a duplex that Tom lives in, however privacy is respected. The beds were really comfortable, and everything was very clean. You can request cleaning during your stay, too, for an added fee. <br/><br/>A tip:  given the location and close proximity to other houses, it can get VERY loud (sound carries in the alley). We were fine, as we sleep with earplugs, but for light sleepers this could get tricky. Definitely suggest earplugs, as you won't want to shut the windows because the breeze off the ocean feels so great.<br/><br/>Thank you, Tom & Jen! Looking forward to seeing you around the neighborhood, and will absolutely recommend that others stay here!",clean
The roof-top deck was particularly nice. A great place to enjoy dinner and a bottle of wine.  Everything was just as advertised. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks Tom and Jen!!,location

Great place and location!,location
Amazing place and great host. Could not go wrong.,location
"We stayed there twice during the last 3 weeks and the place is fabulous when you look for something in Venice close to the beach. If you come with a car the parking offered is also an asset since parking in that area is a rather scarce resource. The rooftop terrace is a real hit for sundowners, bbq or friends of a hot tub. The fridge and kitchen offered basic supplies and welcome drinks: very appreciated after a long flight from Europe. All in all a great place to stay with great hosts and a full recommendation!",location
The house is beautiful and the position just excellent. The house deck is worth the whole house. Tom is very careful with details and prompt answers. He is local and very helpful with suggestions if needed. You cannot be wrong. Enjoy.,location
"Lovely home, close to the beach, rooftop terrace was a fantastic place to socialise day/ night, lots going on beachfront during the day, much less in the evening. Eating out in the evening is best along the  Main Street, which is only a block away, where you will find bars/ restaurants.",location
Awesome roof with jacuzzi- great location!,location
"Super convenient location. Easy safe walk to beach and AbbottKinney. The space was comfyâ plenty of room, light and air.  We really enjoyed it... hope to visit again soon.",location
"The location, house and facilities were fantastic - the pictures do not do the house justice. The house was extremely clean, light and airy. Minutes to the boardwalk/beach and great shops and eateries within walking distance. We were a bit disappointed to discover upon our arrival that use of laundry facilities (washing machine & dryer) was not included in the accommodation costs, and was charged at an extra $100 per day. As a family of 4 who had been travelling around the US for 2 weeks, we had expected this to be part of the package. Also of note, the host is very much there and you are aware of this - this will certainly appeal to some, whilst may not be others preference, but thought it worth noting.",clean
Very accommodating and had all the essentials that we needed for our stay with kids! Glad we found this incredible spot!,clean

Joshua is a great host! He was extremely responsive to any questions I had. This place is in a great location in Koreatown and walking distance to plenty of restaurants and bars.

It was over all satisfying I recommend this place to stay,location
"Joshua was helpful, respectful, and very responsive. I really enjoyed the location and the place I stayed at!",location
"This is a great place for the price. Location was central or a short drive/walk to where we wanted to go. The place was pretty clean and larger than we expected. There is a fan and wall unit for a/c which we used the whole time we were there. Right outside the door is a small common area with a few chairs and small table. People do smoke there and you will be able to smell it a bit but it's not something leaving the fan on can't fix. There are two full beds, sofa, small fridge, small kitchen with stove and sink. We came during the weekdays and weren't able to find street parking for ourselves so we just parked in the driveway. We met a few of the hosts friends and they were really friendly and helpful. 10/10 would stay again.",clean

"This air bnb property is in a great location, about 2 blocks from the beach. The surrounding area is cute and walkable. <br/>    We had a few issues during our stay, but Thomas was there to help each time. <br/>    There are quite a few stairs in this property so people should know ahead of time that this would not be good for anyone who isnât up for stair climbing. The stairs didnât bother us at all as we like the work out they offer. <br/>     We enjoyed our stay at this property. The beds were comfortable & the proximity to the beach is great.",location
"We loved our stay at Thomas's place!  It was very clean, comfortable and stylish.  Lots of cool California touches like beautiful carved wooden doors and antique surf boards mounted on the patio ceiling.  Plenty of pillows, towels, and nice sheets. Kitchen had plenty of dishes etc.  The photos don't do justice to the roof deck - it's spectacular, wish we had spent more time hanging out up there - but there is so much to explore.  The location is minutes from the beach. Venice and Santa Monica neighborhoods, shops and restaurants are within walking distance or a quick Uber. Thomas and Jessica were very responsive and happy to offer suggestions.  There is a parking space available (a must if you rent a car!)  However, it is behind the house in a narrow alley which was difficult to navigate in an SUV.   Our only suggestion would be to rent a small car or use ride sharing.  Thanks again Thomas and Jessica!",clean
"We loved our stay at Thomas's place.  The location is very central to everything in Venice, restaurants, the beach, shopping, and playgrounds were all walkable from his place. We especially loved how close we were to the beach! <br/><br/>The rooftop was even more beautiful than the pictures on the listing.  Tom's rooftop garden of succulents were stunning.  We were traveling with our 18 month old so hanging out on the rooftop during nap time and after he was in bed was wonderful.  <br/><br/>Tom had a crib and a high chair which made our stay very easy as well. The kitchen is well stocked and the rooftop has a grill that we loved using.  We highly recommend staying at Thomas's place. You won't regret it.",location

Also close to Main and Pacific streets that have a lot of places to visit.  The house is nice and the roof top is great.  It's a bit quirky, like most places in Venice.  That's the trend for the neighborhood.  The kitchen has all that is needed.  The beds are comfortable.  The pillows were a bit flat for our taste and we had to use 2-3 at a time.

I spent honestly like 12 hours in total in this thing, I am now an aquatic mammal.<br/><br/>Location is so close to the beach but far enough that it isnât in the public way.<br/><br/>Bedrooms were great, stereos, Apple TV, big tvs, outdoor fire pit on the the roof.<br/><br/>Seriously worth the money and felt more like a friend of the landlord than a customer, that said you do t see him too often either so itâs still really private.<br/><br/>WOULD RECOMMEND!!",clean

"Had high expectations coming into our stay based on the nice-looking photos and great reviews, and happy to share that Tom's place didn't disappoint.  Truly great location if you like being close to the beach and night life/restaurants - block and a half from the beach and we found Abbot Kinney (couple minute walk) to be very lively with many restaurants, bars, night life, etc.  More space than the photos may lead you to believe.  Very open living area with high ceilings.  Stairs lead you up from the entrance/foyer to the 2nd level, which is where the 2 queen bedrooms are located.  Between the 2 bedrooms is a full bathroom with a walk-in shower and 2 shower heads (overhead rain-style head and propped-up movable head).  Up another flight of stairs is the living area, kitchen, and half bath.  All very clean and nicely appointed.  TV on the main level is an older flat screen - I think probably 47 inches.  A spiral staircase takes you up to the roof where we enjoyed soaking in the hot tub with a fire going in the pit.  Very nice and relaxing!  Tom lives on the other side of the property (completely separate unit with his own entrance) and was very respectful of our privacy.  I would recommend his place to anyone visiting the area.",location
"Thanks for your nice appartement, it was a pleasure for us.",clean
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Joshâs place- super comfortable beds, convenient location and great people (and dogs :))",location
"Great little spot in a location close to Korea town. Parking is on the premise which is great, you do need to leave your keys in a communal area in case they need to move the car which is totally understandable. Very clean inside with a common area outside you can chill out in. Josh was also very quick to answer texts when we had questions about check-in when we were running a little late.",clean
Itâs right next to ktown so you can go around eat and shop.  Also itâs easy to get uber or Lyft at the area.  He does offer one good parking since itâs hard to park around.  Josh is friendly and easy to talk to and he is very informative about the area.  The place is very private so you donât have to worry about talking to other tenants if youâre quiet type.  It has its own kitchen and bathroom so thatâs nice.  <br/><br/>Also try to be respectful of your host since it is rare to fine someone this friendly and awesome so itâs not an invitation to take advantage of him.,location
"Joshua's place was perfect for our last minute reservation. It was clean, comfortable and close to all we wanted to do. Joshua himself was fantastic-gave us local eating info, and the free parking a total bonus in LA. Would stay here again!",clean
"Thomasâs place was absolutely beautiful, and comfortable and even nicer than what we expected. The rooftop terrace was like sitting in the midst of a botanical<br/>garden. Such a short walk to both the beach and shopping. We would definitely return.",location
We had a lovely stay at this wonderful home. The rooftop garden was truly special and the home was furnished with very comfortable and stylish touches. We really felt like we were at home. Thank you Thomas and Jessica!,location
Spectacular roof top is exactly what this Venice home provides!!  Tom has a green thumb and has created an oasis with the many plants and tree's that surround the roof top making it feel very private and relaxing.  The location couldn't be better being situated so close to the beach and town...easy to walk and/or ride the bikes on the promenade.  The total home is well equipped with all the accommodations you would need.  We enjoyed cooking in and found the kitchen to be perfect!!  Thank you Jessica and Tom for making me and my daughters feel very welcome....until next time.  New Jersey Cindy,location
We had a great time staying at the house. Especially enjoyed the roof top deck.  The house is in a perfect location for exploring Venice Beach. In one direction your a block away from the famous boardwalk and the beach and  in the other direction your a block away from Abbot Kinney with its small unique stores and some of the best restaurants in town. We canât wait to book the house again next summer.,location
Deck is worth the stay,location
The rooftop was even more beautiful than I could have imagined and the hot tub was the highlight of my stay. Plenty of towels and other necessities. The owner was very pleasant and ready to resolve any issues. The WiFi did not work for half of my stay which was a huge inconvenience as I was working from the home. However the owner was eventually able to fix the problem and I am very thankful for his efforts. There is no AC as the listing states therefore you will need to keep the windows open. A consequence of that is the creatures from outside end up inside.,location
Really great location and place. Blocks from beach with a private roof deck.,location
"Thomasâs home is comfortable and well located. The rooftop is an absolute oasis and unlike anything youâd expect to experience in the dense Venice neighborhood. We stayed here for a few weeks and really enjoyed the unitâs multiple levels which allowed us to separate sleeping from living from outdoor enjoyment. There was plenty of room to work from home without cluttering the main living room.  The kitchen was well equipped and had everything you need from a long-term rental. The home is secure behind a tasteful metal front gate which definitely made us feel at ease from some of the typical Venice weirdness. <br/><br/>The photos of the rooftop donât to it justice. Itâs tropical with various plants and trees. There is a view of the ocean as well as sweeping 360 views of LAâs topography making watching sunsets unbelievable (that is, if you canât make it to the beach less than 3-mins walk away). There is also plenty of places to sit and hangout in the rooftop, with the fire pit being a perfect add-on for the cooler nights. <br/><br/>Truly one of the best hide-aways in Venice and highly recommend.",location
"The location of this rental is fantastic- so close to the beach! We loved the rooftop area, which is just as pictured. We had a couple maintenance issues especially with the oven not working, but the host lives in the adjacent duplex so was nearby for assist as needed.",location
We had a great time at this AirBNB. The apartment was well appointed and decorated appropriately for the area. The rooftop was the stand-off and added uniqueness to the rental. Tom and Jessica were always available and prompt in responding to messages. The instructions for check in and out were very clear.,clean
"The location is amazing! Literally 5 minutes walking to the beach and another 5 minutes to great restaurants and shops on Abbot Kinney, this made our trip much easier.<br/><br/>Jessica and Tom were always easy to reach and good communicators.<br/><br/>We will be definitely coming back.",location
"Josh was super friendly, accomadating, and outgoing host. Josh let us play with his two beautiful dogs that my daughter loved. His bed and house was super comfortable and clean. Easy walking distance to food, restaurants, super market and much more. The t.v was amazing, you could watch anything on YouTube, Netflix and much more. He made our stay very nice and will definitely come back again for another stay in LA!",clean
Great place to stay! Really nice and friendly host!,location
Clean and very good place to stay. ,clean
"Cute place! Loved that it was walking distance to many restaurants and stores, and the location seems pretty safe to walk in. It's great that Joshua provides a parking space for one car, as street parking can be pretty challenging in this area (and LA in general). There are also other guests staying in a unit next to this one so keep in mind that you might hear people outside -- we heard people talking at 2 AM, and while I'm a heavy sleeper, my partner isn't and was woken up by voices late at night.",location
Joshua was very responsive and a great host!,clean
"The space is intimate and beautiful! Josh maintains a clean and welcoming environment, opening his studio as a home away from home! Thanks again!",clean
This was such a cute place! The beds were amazingly comfortable and the sheets were so soft! The whole atmosphere was so cute and the hosts were so hospitable. A really great experience!,location
"Amazing communication. Possibility of drive way parking. Quiet neighborhood, but close to main attractions. Everything you need and nothing you donât. Not the newest space. I have a particularly sensitive nose and noticed a slight musky odor mixed with a hint of cigarette smoke. You might not notice at all. I think the price was definitely fair.",clean
"I was on a road trip with 5 friends and we used Josh's place while we were in LA. Communication and check-in was straightforward, and the included parking spot in the city was super helpful! Right off the bat, Josh was a very friendly and helpful host, giving us a very amiable welcome and recommendations for our short time in the city. He's very nice but not overly formal like some hosts, which we appreciated. Because he had another space unexpectedly available, he just bumped it to us and gave us 2 rooms instead of the single we reserved, which was super rad! Definitely recommend!",host
"Fantastic property offering the true Malibu country experience.  Comfortable, quiet and stylish with exceptional outdoor space.  Our family loved our time here and will visit again!",location
We loved the fact that it was such a quaint place with amazing views! Would definitely go again!,location
"We had a really good time at Ryan's place! The apartment was very quiet, clean and confortable. Ryan was a really nice host, he always made sure we had everything we needed ! Los Angeles and Malibu's beaches are easily accessible by car. We recommend it !",clean

"Great stay at Joshuaâs! Perfect location, close to West Hollywood and downtown. Would recommend renting a car if you stay here! ",location
"Great place in a great location! If Iâm ever in town again, Iâd definitely try to stay here again. Room was as advertised and was able to house my entire group comfortably. The host and his friends were also super friendly and as accommodating as you need him to be. He was also able to offer a bunch of great places to visit nearby. Room also included Apple TV and Netflix, both of which were a bonus in addition to the great place :)",location
We had a great stay! Josh is super friendly and is a great host. Heâs helpful and a nice person to talk to. Itâs a nice area and with Uber or Lyft you get anywhere you need/want to!,location
Joshua was great! I really felt like a local staying at his place. Relaxing atmosphere as well as great communication. I would recommend Joshua's place to anyone!,location
"My week stay with Jose during a work trip was very pleasant. He is such a gracious host, saving me a parking space in front whenever he got home earlier than me, sharing snacks, and accommodating me on extremely short notice. He checked in regularly to make sure I was comfortable. His home is well decorated, neat, and quiet, and his small dog was fun to play with. There was no dog hair around the house, the internet worked well, and the neighborhood felt safe. There were a variety of restaurants within a 5-minute walk. I also appreciated that he has a water filter. I would stay again.",host
"I stayed with Jose for three months during my internship in Burbank. My sister stayed with me my first week there and came to visit near the middle of my stay as well. Jose was very welcoming to us both and left us a bowl of fruits and a couple of waters and granola bars. His place is very clean and the room is exactly as pictured. He also gave me use of the hallway bathroom for myself and replaced the towels with fresh ones every week. And since I was staying so long, he also gave me a large shelf in one of his cabinets for food. His dog is also very friendly and welcomed me whenever I walked through the door. <br/><br/>The neighborhood also felt very safe and I rarely had trouble finding parking, but make sure to follow the parking signs because the policemen in the area do follow them religiously. There was construction going on next to his place that woke me up a couple of mornings, but that was not any fault of Jose's. I never used the bus system while in L.A., but the Orange Line was only a block away. Heâs also less than a 5 minute drive from the Red Line Metro Station, which I took advantage of several times. His home is also within walking distance to a grocery store, a 7-Eleven, and a few restaurants.<br/><br/>If I had any questions regarding where things were, the best way to get somewhere, or any general question, Jose was more than willing to help out. If I ever come back to L.A., I would definitely be willing to stay with him again. ",clean
"I was impressed by Jose from the first conversation between us. He was the most hospitable and accepting to all me requests among all the others I had spoken to. Since I was making my observership in CHLA, I needed a quite clean place, suitable for studying and nearby CHLA, which Joseâs apartment couldnât be any more matching. I was impressed even more on my first day: very clean and organized place (including the kitchen), the room and bathroom were bigger than I imagined and very tidy. He then took me on a quick exploration walk in the neighborhood (which was very quiet and safe at night (sometimes I arrived after 12 am) and rich in restaurants and many other places, beside the Metro orange line, 3 min walk, and Metro red line, 1 station away). I canât describe how helpful and cooperative Jose was and from the first day till the last day (HE DROVE ME TO THE FLYAWAY BY HIS CAR AT 5:30 AM!!) from the smallest detail to the big decisions (he literally made my stay much easier and comfortable and also cheaper, he offered me advice in many things) he also offered to receive my shipped package in his office (which was a really big favor), we had amazing time chatting. Regarding the apartment, I have been to many apartments, this one is really the BEST, I almost felt at home, nothing was missing and nothing was annoying, EVERYTHING WAS JUST PERFECT! <br/>",clean
Amazing! Jose was a perfect host. Not too clingy and not too distant. The apt is very nice. The bed is great. Private bathroom was awesome. And tons of free parking. ,location
"Jose was a phenomenal host along with his amazing energetic dog, Foster. He was patient and was very accommodating with our travel plans. The place was as described and was very convenient, both for those travellers who have cars or those who prefer public transit. The TV in the room along with the Netflix / Amazon capability was a plus!<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking to live close to freeways and public transit, and is looking for an amazing host who is very attentive to your needs.",location
"Jose is a fantastic host!  Great place/great room.  Pictures and accommodations are accurate.  He even had some fruit, water, and a granola bar waiting for me upon arrival.  Great location and he is very knowledgeable about the area.  Very respectful and easy to get along with.  Has a little dog who's super nice, too.  I'd definitely stay here again!",clean

Jose is a great host that is flexible, helpful, respectful, and friendly. He showed me around the place, answered all my questions, offered local resources, and was super accommodating with a couple of special requests (late check in + bike storage). The room is large and equipped with all the essentials, including desk, chair, tons of storage, a comfortable bed, and awesome ceiling fan. The private bathroom is a major plus. Quiet building that ensured that after long days I always got a good night's sleep. And Foster, the house pup is a delight! I'd return in a heartbeat!",location

Joshuaâs place was an excellent Airbnb experience!! He was a wonderful host that greeted us upon our arrival. He was very responsive when we needed information and knew of all the cool spots in the area. My young adult children now refer to him as the cool uncleââUncle Joshâ. The guest home was nicely decorated and provided more than enough space for five adults. Comfortable beds and nice hot showers. Weâll be back in LA before the end of the year and weâll definitely use one of Joshuaâs properties. Heâs amazing!!!,host
I would recommend anyone to stay at Joshuaâs!! The guest house is a perfect size and the location really couldnât get any better! Host and others were very friendly and helpful with any recommendations.  We will definitely be returning :),location

The place is very spacious, has all the cooking utensils you would need, and if thereâs anything you need Joshua is super quick to reply! He even has (Hidden by Airbnb) :)<br/><br/>Location was super convenient, just close enough to dtla and Westbrook Hollywood for short Uberâs that donât cost more than $15. Buses are everywhere too, and walking distance to coffee, amazing endless Korean food (might need a month in this area or more to actually try everything) <br/><br/>I felt very safe in this area too, late night water bottle runs wonât be a risk ;)<br/><br/>Really enjoyed our stay and would stay here again for sure.",location
"I am still relaxed from the best girls weekend away at this amazing house!  The space is beautiful and the property is like a dream. There was room enough for all of us to sleep well, with the sound of owls as a lullaby. The kitchen is well equipped & we had gourmet meals outside on the deck all weekend! The hot tub, the sauna, the peace and quiet, the books, the art, the vibe was perfect. Deya provided a welcome book that provided us with all we needed to know about the house and the surrounding areas...although our only trip away from the house was to Topanga town center...Heyoka Hideout & Hidden Treasures for cool vintage and the General Store has anything you may have forgotten allowing us to stay in the Canyon. Hikes from the house, yoga on the deck and privacy to have our very own spa. We watched movies on the big tv, played records and danced the night away! Thank you Deya for a retreat that we have already booked for next year!",location
Great perfect thanks ,clean
"We had the most wonderful weekend retreat at this incredibly peaceful home. It was the perfect place for six old college girl friends to gather, talk and talk, eat elaborate meals together outside, soak in the hot tub, and explore the area - what a gem of a location, so close to happening L.A. beaches and hip neighborhoods, yet a world away. I slept more deeply than I have in a long time. Also, Deya was a very gracious and helpful host. She met us when we arrived, helped with directions, offered lots of tips on things to do in the area and responded quickly when we had a question about the house. Twelve thumbs up from us - highly recommended!!",location

"The Topanga Canyon house is absolutely magical! It is even better in person than in the great pictures. It is very comfortable even for a larger group gathering, although it wold be tough to sleep more than 8 for a prolonged stay. The house has a lot of privacy without being totally secluded; neighbors are friendly and helpful (couple of the guests got lost on the way and were directed by the neighbors). You can park your car at the house and walk to great hikes. The views are lovely and peaceful. We did morning yoga on the front patio and it was awesome.  The house has wi-fi, which is crucial as cell reception is spotty; there is also a landline. It is absolutely perfect for hanging out, enjoying lounging on the patio, a dip in a hot tub, beautiful sunsets and sunrises. It also close enough to the Topanga village and the beach to stay over if beach vacation is your main goal. It's like being in the countryside yet just a short skip and hop to the city and beach.<br/>Deya is a wonderful hostess; she met us at the house, welcomed us with an excellent bottle of wine and cheese. She made sure the house was fully equipped and stocked for guests. We had a great time!",location
"Topanga Canyon Paradise! For anyone looking to get away from the noise and crowding of any city, this is the destination.  As a first time user of AirBnB, I had no idea what to expect from the host and her home.  Deya was patient in answering all my questions and silly request to be able to host some additional guest while saying in her home.  She was warm and friendly over email and exactly the same in person.  <br/><br/>Deya welcomed us to her home when we arrived.  A small tour with some instructions on basic use of the gorgeous sauna, claw bath tub in the master bed room (I mean how cool is that??), tv remotes and Jacuzzi settings.  We were enamored with all of it. The decor is exactly what it needs to be surrounded by such breath taking mountains and greenery.  Dream catchers abound! Every morning when the light would shine through each window to welcome you back from dreaming....I would almost forget where I was at that point.  PS. bedding is outstanding.  <br/><br/>The outside is absolutely mesmerizing..that amazing deck so high above the rest...all you see is clear skies with every star imaginable.  I forgot what stars looked like until Topanga.  I forgot what stars looked like in a Jacuzzi until Deya's lovely home.  <br/><br/>We used all her appliances to cook huge meals.  She had it all, including a Panini press, which came in very handy for yummy breakfast sandwiches.  The stereo was perfect just loud enough to get thrown back into 70's rock and roll (Deya has a great collection of vinyls).  Just a perfect combination of old school with new school.  <br/><br/>I highly recommend this gorgeous home to anyone looking to disconnect (the reception isn't great up there, which to me was exactly what I needed).  Deya you might become a weekend tradition, we'll see you in a couple months.  ",host
Joshua's place is a great find for any type of stay in LA.  We had loads of room for a family of four and it was great to have a kitchen and access to a washer and dryer.  Free parking right up to our door was a bonus. Josh was incredibly helpful sharing his knowledge of LA and we felt very lucky to have found his place.  Will definitely stay with Josh again.,location

"Joshua's place is exactly how you see the pictures. He is super accommodating & reachable, let us check-in early etc. The place is a 5 minute walk from the purple line which is great - close to a big boulevard, but enough in a residential area to also be away from all of the commotion. Joshua & his friends are SUPER nice, and were great to talk to. They gave us recommendations on where to eat & grab coffee, offered us a glass of wine, a piece of cake they had made etc. Very safe area as well. Only thing I would say is there is no cable, just Apple TV (my mom & are are traditional!!), and there was a bit of an odor in the washroom (open the window there and you'll be fine though!!) Would stay again!!",location

"Ah, this house is so ridiculously gorgeous & cozy. The light is absolutely incredible, it's better than the photos. We had six comfortably, & could have had 10 comfortably. I'll be back with my family. The house is modern-rustic with plants & beautiful things everywhere. There's quite a few different seating areas to enjoy the incredible view, not to mention the hot tub we lived in under the stars. The neighborhood is classic Topanga, secluded, windy & intimate but a drive away from really fantastic restaurants, the beach, shopping. It's nice & high, though, so it feels open & expansive. Deya clearly loves her home, with a great eye for comfort, function & beauty. She was super-helpful with plenty of maps, notes & a book to make sure we got what we needed. It was very easy to communicate with her before, during & after. The bathroom has beautiful tile in the shower, a bath & cedar sauna. The beds are super-comfy & she let us use a futon with plenty of extra bedding so we had extra space. There's a hammock under the oaks & a lovely little garden by the deck where we did small group yoga & meditation. We had mellow friends over for dinner & the living room  was able to hold plenty of us very comfortably. Overall the experience was kinda dreamy & we all plan to come back! Thanks Deya!",location

Topanga Canyon is a magical place and Deya's home was the perfect spot to enjoy our family time together. The house has a really cool vibe with beautiful views and everything you need to be happy and comfortable- we loved having coffee in the morning on the deck with views overlooking the canyon. We spent much of our vacation at the beaches and local dining spots in Malibu- it's really convenient and a short drive down the hill. We really appreciated all the suggestions and recommendations that Deya provided. We will definitely come and stay again on our next trip out to Southern California (but will probably pick a time when there isn't a record heat wave!)<br/>,location
"Deya's place is magnificent! Everything about it is exactly as described and more. Both rustic and luxurious, it is perfectly laid out and divinely designed, with every amenity. Deya was wonderful through every step of the process and communication was easy and sincere. Even though we never met up, she was so giving and available, with her and a close friend helping us with every need. My sisters and I, along with my nephew, enjoyed such a beautiful, fun (the games closet was a huge hit), relaxing getaway right here in LA. Close enough to do things around town, but far enough up in the mountains (with STUNNING views, nature sounds and peace) that we felt like we were in a beautiful other land. The house is a cozy, gorgeous place with every amenity and truly an ecological gem. I loved it so much I stayed an extra night. I will definitely be returning, on my own or with friends, at it as perfect for entertaining and it is to just lay around reading and writing in the hammock. I'm happy to recommend this place to everyone, except I want it to be available the next time I decide to go!! ",location

Hands down the most accepting and polite air bnb host ever.  He also had some cute ass puppies to pet. I'm pretty sure I'm in love with this dude and his place,clean
"Deya made us feel right at home as soon as we arrived. She was very thorough with information about the house and the area. The house was a magic experience for our entire family and the perfect getaway. 10-15 minutes from the beach, close to all of the hiking and mountain bike trails and finishing the day with clear, star lit, nights in the hot tub. There is even a turntable with a nice vinyl collection. We hope we can return soon.",location
The house was great. Just as described. We had a great family time. ,clean
"Nice place, very clean, quick response and very welcoming host.",clean
Deya's home was wonderful! There is a consciousness and care infused into every room. The views from the porch are epic and it was a perfect space for our group to gather and connect. Communication with Deya as well as check-in/check-out was very easy. <br/><br/>Thank you for an absolutely lovely stay!,location
"Deya's house is one of the kind! We cooked, baked our Thanksgiving diner and enjoyed it on the table outside in a beautiful Californian afternoon! Every morning we had our breakfast outside, the view is perfect.  ",location
We absolutely loved Deya's Airbnb in Topanga. Everything about the house is perfect - and she is a perfect host! I would highly recommend this place to anyone interest in winding down and letting 'time slow down' living up in the canyon. The house is full of character with sweeping views of the canyon. Incredibly clean and well set up for guests. We loved every aspect of it and could not recommend more if you plan to visit Topanga Canyon. ,location
"Deya's place provided the ideal Topanga experience.  We met up with two couples (the guys are childhood friends of my husband . . . and now my eight-month old son), one from the Bay Area and one from Massachusetts.  Everyone enjoyed themselves immensely, relaxing on the expansive deck, soaking in the hot tub and taking in the beautiful view of Big Rock and beyond.  We even spotted a horned owl up close at breakfast. Minutes away from hikes and Malibu beaches.  We would definitely book this space again, if the occasion arises.",location
"This home is comfortable and inviting.  The views are lovely and the location great for going to the beach, hiking and relaxing.",location
"Beautiful house at a scenic place!! Me, my cousins and friends stayed in this beautiful house during Independence day weekend. We had expectation for this house by looking at the pictures. But the house beaten all our expectations with all the minute decor, arts, scenic patio and Jacuzzi. We feel love with the house and we will definitely come back. This house has so much to offer with lot of books, music, gaming etc., Unfortunately, we couldn't spend much time in the house as we were out visiting LA.  Deya was a amazing host, she helped us with accurate driving directions as one part of the route was closed due to Brush fire. She was super courteous.  We enjoyed by stargazing sitting in Jacuzzi and having breakfast sitting in the scenic patio. I would have never imagined to see such a beautiful scenic place right next to LA City. Just one tip to future renters, please be respectful to all the beautiful decor in the house :-).",location
Amazing house in amazing location. The deck looking the montains is gourgeous. Very quiet and close to all North LA interest points.<br/>The house is need some better cleaning.,location
"Every detail of this house is well thought out and designed.  The architecture is fantastic, the light inside is perfect, it is full of healthy beautiful plants, and super comfortable.  The outdoor lounging space is a real plus and the master bedroom is so stylish.  It is hidden deep within Topanga canyon, so be prepared for some windy roads, but still only about 15 minutes from Topanga beach at Malibu.  Cool functional kitchen with a variety of coffee brewing options, hand made pottery and everything you need to cook at the house.  Living room is open with a high ceiling and cozy couches and chairs.  Super library and vinyl collection as well.  Its the kind of place that makes you jealous of the people who get to live there all the time.  It was very hot during the day, but I stayed in the beginning of August, and the outdoor temps were around 100.  There is a portable Air Con unit that helped cool the living room area.  The end of our stay saw some cooler days and the morning we left was absolutely perfect outside.  I imagine cooler weather is probably the year round norm.  Great communication and suggestions on how to enjoy the house and surrounding area.  Highly recommended, especially if you don't mind being a little off the beaten path.",location
"This is a wonderful place to stay!  The beds are comfy, the kitchen has everything you need and there are great spaces inside for everyone. But the deck with the views and the hot tub and the relaxing feel is the best!  We spent every morning and evening on the deck enjoying meals, drinks, games, hot tubbing  or just hanging out. Deya is welcoming, kind, responsive and helpful. This is also a great location for hiking and beaches while also feeling like you are far away from it all. We loved it!! ",location
was a good fit for my vacation and comfort. close to stores and interesting things to do and see within reasonable distance.,location
"If you are looking for a relaxing, secluded, beautiful place to just sit and enjoy life and nature, it doesnât get better than this!  I will definitely be coming back in the future!  Highly recommend this home and the jacuzzi under the stars!",location
A beautiful property and location,location
"This place is a magical getaway unlike anywhere we've stayed. The house and surroundings are a wonderful mix of rugged wilderness and beautifully curated plants and decorations. Deya was a great host, the perfect mix of relaxed and responsive, with detailed instructions about every little thing in the house. Our kids also had a great time, spending hours in the hot tub. The deck was a really comfortable and a gorgeous place to relax. <br/><br/>We did bump into the tenant (we did a lot of laundry :-)) and he was also chill and friendly.",location
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Deya's place.  The drive up (and down) was so beautiful, and then the amazing views from her house and deck kept us happy all week!  The house is clean and so comfortable, with relaxing and homey spaces that worked perfectly for our group of 6.  Beautiful plants everywhere, a relaxing hot tub, all the amenities we needed, comfortable beds!  Deya was very welcoming, meeting us as we arrived and showing us around.  She was also extremely responsive and helpful throughout our stay.  We would definitely love to repeat this experience!",location
"This was my second stay and it was just as good as the first time!!  I highly recommend this home for the quite, the view, the comfort, the cleanliness, and the hostess!!  Iâm sure Iâll be booking again myself!",location
"This house is absolutely gorgeous. We spent the evenings on the deck under the stars and in the amazing jacuzzi. Itâs a 15 minute drive from one of my favorite beaches - Topanga State Beach where you can rock hound, watch surfers and swim. We also loved listening to records on her record player. It is a peaceful house that instantly puts you in relaxation mode. My 3 year old daughter loved it! Deya was an incredible host! She responded to my texts/questions right away and was so accommodating! I Highly recommend this house! Itâs a gem!",location
"Magnificent location with just spectacular views.  Deya's home evokes nostalgia, wonderment and relaxation.  The magic of staying in Topanga was only enhanced by all of Deya's personal touches.  We listened to records and drank wine chalices, mason jars, not mention beautiful glassware.  The kitchen was fully stocked with sharp, top grade knives, pots and appliances for great meals.  Plants abound.  How she takes care of so many has me baffled.  <br/><br/>Our only challenge was the heat.  Our decision to rent in August.  We did so in order to take our boys to surf camp for the week in Malibu without struggling to get all the way across Los Angeles.  There were fans in every room, and somehow the kids were still able to spend hours in the hot tub.  The heat is always a challenge around here.  With any luck, Deya will get air conditioning and never be able to get rid of us.<br/><br/>I highly recommend spending some weekdays here when the beach traffic is less severe.  The drive up and down the canyon is way better than the 101!!",location
"This Airbnb is such an incredible place, filled with greenery, both in and out, spacious decks and vast views...lots of books to find your zen...We always feel so relaxed and comfortable...I actually find it hard to leave since the tranquility of crickets and moonlit nights and daytime spacious views make it the place to be!<br/>She is very accessible!!<br/>Definitely one of the best places to stay in Topanga!    5 stars!",location
Beautiful location and very comfortable house. Great host.<br/><br/>The driving is a little circuitous,location
"We had a wonderful stay with a group of six for a team building retreat. Even on a rainy weekend, there was plenty of indoor space for our group to stay entertained. Deyaâs communication and check in was flawless, and the house was a wonderful oasis that we didnât want to leave. The views are outstanding in person and the whole house is beautiful. We really appreciated the well appointed kitchen as we cooked many meals for our group.",location
"Great space in Topanga!<br/>Would book again, so beautiful.",location
"First, this place is much better than the pictures convey! The view from the deck and hot tub are phenomenal, and the house itself is perfectly decorated and furnished, with light flooding through all spaces. We loved the hot tub, sauna, and chimnea, and the beds were comfortable in each room. The location is great - just a 15 or 20 min drive to the PCH and very close to town while still being quiet and away from the bustle. Deya was incredibly responsive via message and offered sweet local tips for our stay. One note is that the internet was spotty a few times during our stay - this may have been because of work on local roads but is something to be aware of given that there's no cell phone reception at the house and wifi seems to be the best way to stay connected with the outside world (if that's on your agenda - this is also a perfect house in which to disconnect and relax).",location
"Decent space, inexpensive, would be happy to return. ",location
Loved our stay and josh had the cutest dogs!,clean
This place was ok. It was a last minute booking so we really appreciated that. Kitchen was well stocked with cooking essentials. The room provided what we needed. <br/>The only things we didnât like were the dust and dog poop on common walking areas. The room itself didnât feel clean. We did like that parking was included and that there was a laundry machine for our use. <br/><br/>Over all it was an ok experience . Host was very nice and personable. We just didnât like the poop and dust. The unit we had was located in the back of the main house which shared a mini âfront yardâ with two other units. WALKING distance to food and other quick shops which was awesome. Freeways close by too quick uber ride downtown. Location was awsome <br/>,clean
"My 1st Airbnb experience and even though we were only there one night it was awesome. Joshua is very friendly, laid back and helpful. The house is adorable and has everything you need including very comfy beds. Location was very central to everything we wanted to do, and was in a cute little neighborhood. Joshua gave us some great recommendations of things we didnt know were there and easy directions. 100% happy with our stay. For anyone going to LA this is definitely the place to stay. I know we'll be back. Thanks for everything Joshua!",location
Great place and location. Comfortable beds and quiet area. Joshua is great with lots of tips,location

"My 1st Airbnb experience was great with Joshua. He was a great host, easy going, and flexible. ",host
"Great location,  nice and accomodating host, and very cute dogs. One small gripe is that the air conditioning is not cold enough for summer days. Otherwise, it was an excelleny stay!",location
"Joshua's place was clean, located close to great spots in DTLA, and parking was available in the driveway which was a major plus. Check in was easy. Josh was a great host and quick to respond. ",clean
"Nice, always quick to respond, check-in and out fast and  giving me a custom meeting time.",clean
"Great place! Right near the heart of K-Town (Korea Town). So many things to do and so many places of food to try. Plus, 20 mins away from Universal.",location
"Exactly as described. Actually a very good value bnb, great location and pretty lights outside as well. Our host was actually so receptive and picked up calls immediately. That was very refreshing.",location
"Josh was an excellent host (communication was quick, efficient). The house was clean, very comfortable, and has a great location (central to many parts of LA).",clean
"We got to the place very late and the host kept responding to us even though it was late. It was going great  when we got there until I had a couple of questions and he was unresponsive. It was ok though because I imagine he fell asleep due to the time we got there. Very nice place, nice drive way, good location. Probably the only bad thing about the place was that the bathroom door wouldnât shut close. Either than that, I wouldnât mind staying there again.",location
Joshua has the most comfortable beds ever! And this place is within walking distance to fast food and a grocery store. Loved staying in this cute and quiet place!,location
Perfect location-Short trip to Hollywood and downtown. Joshua is very nice and hospitable. Place is extremely clean.,clean
Wonderful place to stay.,location
Josh was very accommodating.  great value and location.  the place is close to allot of stores.  very clean and we slept comfortably.,clean
Can't thank Joshua enough for having my loud family for a night. Really nice place.,location
Deya's home is perched at the top of a mountain overlooking the canyons and the quiet solitude and morning fog were refreshing. It is a lovely space and she was extremely responsive and very helpful during the check-in process. I look forward to staying at Deya's home again in the future.,location
"This home is truly that: a beautiful aerie overlooking an exquisite view, with all the amenities. It's pretty high up in the hills--a quiet and enchanted escape from the crowds and traffic in LA. We would head down the hill in the morning to check on surf and play in LA, but were always grateful to get back to Deya's place where all our needs were met. I would definitely come back. One week was not enough in Topanga!",location
Lovely home nestled in the hills. Very cozy and amazing views off of the deck. Would recommend to most.,location
"The place was comfortable, clean, and Joshua was a great host.",clean
Great communications. Easy going host.,clean
"Deya's place is an absolute retreat! From the moment you walk in you'll be stunned by the view of the mountains, the thoughtful decor, and the beautiful artwork. We ended up spending much more time at the house than anticipated as the weekend was a little rainy, but it was quite magical with the views and the hot tub. Would 100% stay here again. Addded bonus that Deya was super communicative and helpful throughout the entire process.",location
This was the perfect place for our family to gather for a few days. We are outdoors people and living at the top of the Topanga Canyon fit our style. And the artwork and photography inside the house is super! The location was central to the sites and activities we did in our first visit to this part of California. I am glad we stayed here.,location
"This place is a gem! Stylish surroundings, views for days, cool breezes, sunny days, and starry nights. Roads a bit windy so can make faint of heart a tad nervous...but we managed no problem! Would definitely stay here again! Thanks Deya!",location
The host canceled this reservation 9 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.,clean
"In no way is my review to be construed as contradictory to other reviews.  The house is charming, quirky, comfortable and has gorgeous views.  I have been on both sides of Airbnb transactions and when I was renting, I always felt an absolute obligation to provide all the challenges the property presented as well as the great things.  There were several things about this property that I don't believe were misrepresented, but that would have been important to point out given the circumstances.  I spoke with Deya about the fact that I was coming with a person who had mobility issues.  As a matter of fact, she made special accommodation to access the house directly to the bedroom level which is normally not accessible to renters.  The problem is the property itself is not conducive to someone who is mobility impaired.  It is a very steep dirt access road which means a person cannot go for a walk.  Second and most important, there is an apartment that is part of the house where a very nice couple live.  Absolutely no problem IF, that is disclosed.  The only part of the house that was shared was the laundry.  But it is very important to know this in advance, not when one is checking in.  Additional, the car belonging to the couple in the apartment was parked in such a way that made access to the drive very very tight.  The last item I will mention is the access to the property in general.  If someone has any issues going up and down a VERY steep winding road, some parts of which are only wide enough for one car and where you must back up if you meet another car, this property would be problematic for you.  The kitchen is truly a cooks kitchen.  You will find everything you need and it is logically located.  I would say, for someone on vacation, this is a great property to consider.  If you will be going up and down and have a schedule to adhere to, I would say the property might be a bit too secluded and timing how long it will take to get from point a to point b might be an issue.",location
"Great location, great house, Joshua is a perfect host!",location
"I can't begin to explain how amazing our stay was at Deya's!  Everything exceeded our expectations!  We gathered for the Thanksgiving holiday and had the most relaxing, beautiful weekend.  Deya met us and showed us around her beautiful home.  The directions to the house were perfect and not difficult to navigate at all.  The views are spectacular!  The kitchen was better equipped for Thanksgiving dinner then I could have ever expected!  She had it all and it was clean and cozy and just beautiful!  Highly recommend!",location
Deyaâs place was perfect for our weekend couples getaway. There are beautiful touches throughout the space and we loved relaxing on the porch and enjoying the hot tub. The location is amazing and the views are spectacular!,location
"This home was is a perfect getaway, a place where you can spend all day relaxing, indoors and outdoors.  Details such as extra blankets, a record player, books, plants made the home feel extra cozy.  There truly is a lot of light in the home; it felt like we were in a treehouse!  If you are not a confident driver be aware the road leading too and from the house is narrow, hilly and windy - but truly worth the stay.  Deya is a gracious and generous host and readily answered any questions I had.  I highly recommend a stay at Deya's home  in Topanga, a chance to explore a charming gem outside of LA.",clean
Great place to stay. Amazing view and outdoor area. Would stay again,location
"Very boho magical stay in the stunning canyon of topanga. Unfortunately we were there during a heat wave so it was uncomfortably hot even with ac units. But we made the most out of it. Itâs should note the space is shared with an attached   apartment with tenants. It is still very private, we only saw them a couple times.  Deya is a fantastic host and we hope to stay at her familyâs other place soon.",location
Most definitely would stay here again. One of the most beautiful views Iâve seen in my life over here. Couch was super comfy. Bedrooms felt like we were at home. Everything was provided for us. Very awesome experience!!,location
"Had a fantastic 3 week stay at Deya's house. The house has very interesting, fun decor. Lots of pictures, books & artifacts. The house was very comfortable & had everything we needed. Very well stocked kitchen, so easy to cook up meals. Location is the best & the deck makes full use of the views. We loved sitting out for meals, drinks & work. Easy access to hikes, the beach & stores. Great stay",location
"The place was as described - good size & close to quite a few things (Griffith Park, Hollywood Blvd and not a bad drive away from the coast (about 35-40min drive). <br/><br/>The only thing I will say is that the parking that's available is tandem parking. There were other guests staying in the place right next to us and we had to be concious of blocking eachother's cars in. Luckily, Joshua was incredibly nice about moving our rental for us when the other occupants were blocked in and vice-versa. <br/><br/>Joshua does have dogs that sometimes roam around the yard, so if you're not too into dogs that's something to think about. But we didn't have much interaction with them at all - so it wasn't a problem for us. <br/><br/>Overall, good price, location, and hospitality.",location
Very beautiful home in a beautiful place.  Original photographs complement the interior decor.  Record collection is the bomb for that nostalgic ear ( old hippie girl that I am).  Location is removed from the hustle of LA and bit of a challenge for one that can't handle curvy mountain roads.  Well worth it.  Hot tub rocks.    Cell service is sketchy but land line is available.,location
This was among my familyâs favorite Airbnb stays of all time. Weâd come again in a heartbeat! Deyaâs place truly feels like a home.,location
"Where do I start? First off, Deya was super nice and easy to communicate with. Secondly and most important, her home is AMAZING! The house has the cutest decor, a fully stocked kitchen, and comfy beds. The deck and hot tub were highlights during staycation. We stayed for 3 days and did not want to leave. Highly recommend!!",location
"Beautiful space and exceptional host. Deya was friendly, responsive, and helpful.",clean
"Awesome home, great location/views. Would highly recommend,",location
"Deyaâs home was absolutely magical. We stayed for four nights for a mother/daughter girls trip and it could not have been more perfect. The location is great - 15 min to Malibu beaches, about 25ish to Santa Monica depending on PCH traffic, 10 min to Calabasas for easy access to grocery/shopping. <br/>The house itself had every amenity we could want (incl Trader Joeâs Everything Bagel spice ð), and the view from the deck was priceless. Deyaâs eclectic decor also provided the cool, peaceful vibe we were all looking for after a year in lockdown! <br/>The very best pizzas and salads (Endless Color) are just a quick drive down the mountain, amazing coffee/tea a couple min past that (Mimosa). <br/>Couldnât recommend this place more highly. We hope to stay again soon!",location
Deya's place is thoroughly wonderful.  All areas are clean and nicely furnished. The sauna and hot tub are in great shape. The views are impressive. Nature is all around and there was even an owl hooting in the night.,location
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this location. Deya provides all of the essentials to make the stay comfortable. The beds are super comfy, the sauna and hot tub are a treat, and the record collection is epic. The biggest challenge with our stay was the driveway to the entrance of the house that could be a little tricky. Deya was a fantastic host.",location
"Deya's home in Topanga is wonderful! The decor is immaculate (I definitely took inspiration!) and the location was beautiful. The house is tucked in a mountain - so the only advice I would give it to make sure you're comfortable driving in the mountains if you stay! <br/>My family and I enjoyed the warm, inviting home, and definitely took advantage of the wrap around deck and hot tub. <br/>Highly recommend staying here!!",location
"What a special place! Deya's home in Topanga is unique, and made for such a memorable vacation.  The view is amazing, and we spent all our time outdoors.  The home is filled with plants, art, photographs, and details that reveal themselves as the days go on. My kids said it was like we were on a treasure hunt! Deya was easy to communicate with before our stay, and the welcome packet gives clear instructions for anything that might have come up. We spent our days at the beach, but Deya's home was the perfect place to start and end each day. Thank you for sharing your home with us!",location
"We absolutely loved our stay at Deyaâs place. It was the perfect getaway for 6 of us. It had everything that we needed and more! Communication with Deya was great leading up to and throughout our trip, even with her being out of town during our stay. Would definitely recommend!",location
"Amazing place - with ecclectic decorations and a bohemian vibe with fun details in every view and corner.  LOVED THIS PLACE - patio is lovely with a gorgeous view and great breezes,  turn table and albums were a fun funky touch.  Very comfy with everything you could need for your stay including yoga mats and to do exercises on the patio and decorative night lights to eat and relax outside after sunset.  JUST PERFECT!!!",location
"Deya's home is beautiful â one of the most beautiful Airbnbs I've had a pleasure of staying in! The decor is impeccable and full of character. I wonder if she or anyone in her family is an interior designers... We especially loved all of the lush plants throughout the house!<br/><br/>The view and landscape surrounding the house is breathtaking! We enjoyed being able to sit on the deck in the morning with a cup of coffee, basking in the sun and listening to the birds. <br/><br/>One thing to note is that because Deya's home is located far up in the hills, it can be challenging to get an Uber/Lyft to pick you up. We struggled to find drivers in the area, and actually ended up calling a taxi service in Thousand Oaks to take us to the airport. Also, there is no cell phone reception at the house which is fine because you can connect to wifi / enable wifi calling. For directions however, you'll want to pull those up while you're still connected to wifi. We had a help a few Uber/Lyft drivers navigate down the hill by memory.",location
"Strongly recomend our host and place, everything was compliant with the description.",clean
Highly recommended,clean
"It takes a lifetime to curate the kind of style that you feel immediately upon entering the hillside retreat. Our family felt swept away to another era, full of bohemian charm. Amazing period-photography from the host family made even us guests feel at-home. We truly felt honored that have such a special place opened to us. Some of our favorite things about the home are the spa jacuzzi, the sauna and waking up to that gorgeous view. Deya was great at communicating and keeping us informed. Our family had a wonderful few days at Deyaâs place. We hope to return.",location
We loved our stay at Deyaâs. Waking up to the sun on the deck every morning was pure bliss. Deya was extra accommodating and the house had everything we needed,location
"We enjoyed our stay here so much.  Traveling with young children can be hard, but this house had a comfortable vibe that allowed us to relax. They also had toys, books and games for the kiddos. The views from the deck were amazing. Overlooking the mountains, we enjoyed star gazing while listening to the crickets at night. The home had an awesome vibe that encouraged you to let go of life and just be. I would definitely return here again.",location
"A truly special place with a lovely decor, wonderful, comfortable outdoor and indoor areas for lounging. All three bedrooms were unique and very well appointed. Deya provided excellent instructions and a very comprehensive review of local options for all kinds of activities. We will certainly return.",location
"This house is a beautiful retreat. Every room has a thoughtful design, and the views from the yard are incredible and peaceful. It was an absolutely perfect stay in Topanga.",location
"Deya was so responsive, I don't think I've ever worked with such a responsive host. Place had a gorgeous view of the valley/canyon, super-homey, beautifully decorated with a nostalgic feel, and great kitchen/lounging/seating areas perfect for getting reuniting with long-time friends. We all admired the skills for adorning this home so well with plants. We didn't use the sauna or hot tub, but we'd love to return to try them both!",location
We have spent a really pleasant stay in a dreamful house located in a wonderful nature. We had the the feeling of living in trees and we had the opportunity to meet a family of racoons. The house is well equiped and furnished with love and a good artistic sense.<br/>We strongly recommend this house.,location

Definitely good idea to have a car considering the area, otherwise bicycles and a lot of endurance!",location
Great apartment in a calm and beautiful area behind Santa Monica. Topanga is quiet a nice and peaceful place in comparison to the never sleeping LA. Bed is very comfortable and the interior of the apartment is nice and equipped with everything you need. We can only recommend this place!,location

"Tracy's place was managed by a hospitality company called the Pillow Team, and we were in touch with Tracy once as well. All parities were easy to communicate with and prompt in their replies. The house itself was just the right size for two, and we particularly enjoyed the spacious kitchen and back patio. The neighborhood is quiet, peaceful, and the neighbors were friendly. We stayed for a little over a week and enjoyed ourselves. Would recommend to anyone looking for a sweet, quiet spot in Eagle Rock. ",location

I booked this house for my father and he reported that it was even more charming than the photos. Couldn't have asked for more... thank you so much, Tracy.",location
We really appreciated and enjoyed our stay in Eagle Rock!  The place met and exceeded our expectations.  The garden patio was a great haven when our one year old napped inside.  I would recommend this property to individuals or couples who want a comfortable and efficient place to perch in Eagle Rock.,location
"I want to thank Tracy for making my first ever Airbnb experience an amazing one! Her house is a perfect size for one person. Having a keyless keypad easily took away the hassle of  having to deal with carrying around an extra key. The location of the house, cul-de-sac and neighborhood made it the perfect getaway/hideaway. My only regret was the fact that I was so busy during my stay that I didn't have time to really enjoy being at the house as much as I would have wanted to. Tracy was always reachable by phone anytime I had a question. I would definitely recommend staying here if you plan to spend time in this area of LA! ",location
Nice location and good communication.,location
Great location and had parking,location
We liked the little house and its location.  Its proximity to the Glendale Freeway made it quite easy to jump on and off to get to all of the other many freeways and all over LA.  The neighborhood is very quiet also.  The house was very clean and had everything we needed.  We wanted to be in east LA which is where this is.  ,clean
The house was super cozy and cute!  Just what we were looking for.  Location was central to everything too.  The area was very quiet.  The owner was very responsive to our emails.  We loved it!  ,location
"The place was just as described and the neighborhood is great- super quiet but also close to lots of things in eagle rock/ highland park so you don't have to go far for restaurants, etc. The location is great, and Tracy was super responsive (though everything was easy to find and self explanatory). It's a bit tight for two people but the amenities more than make up for it- having parking and in unit laundry is amazing, particularly for long stays.",location
"Tracey was extremely helpful, making sure that we were comfortable and had everything that we needed. The place was as described, and we enjoyed a very pleasant stay.",clean
"A very cute and comfortable one bedroom in Eagle Rock. The house only has air conditioning in the bedroom so the rest of house can get warm in the afternoon, but with a fan and windows open it wasn't much of a problem. Has a great kitchen and backyard. Would definitely stay here again. ",clean
"Perfect house for our week stay in LA.  Cozy but not cramped, all amenities you would want and comforting and stylish decor.  Tracy and property manager Ben were both friendly and helpful.  Backyard patio is perfect for entertaining a couple guests.  Great value and good location close to downtown, but far enough north to escape the brunt of LA traffic if you plan your ventures accordingly.  ",location
"I highly recommend a stay at Manor Ct, Eagle Rock.  This remodeled 1 BR bungalow is a gem!  Also, Tracy the owner is amazing.  So helpful and accommodating.  I've stayed at multiple Airbnb's throughout 2015, and this is one of the best out there.   I can tell she has a designer eye because it's done in a hip retro vibe.   Perfect with the Eagle Rock area of LA.  In addition, there's a enclosed yard in the back... a perk!  The street is close to York Ave and Colorado Ave, which are both popular for shopping, restaurants, running errands, etc.  Griffith Park hiking is 10min away. Have a great time if you visit her AirBnb!",location
"I had a very nice stay at Tracy's house.  It is nestled in an off beat cul-de-sac between Eagle Rock Blvd. and the 2 fwy.- There was no freeway noise and I liked the tucked away feel of it.  Tracy has done a very nice job of creating a comfortable environment.  The entry/living room dining room is tiny, but was comfortable and was all I needed.  The kitchen is a generous size and very well equipped, including spices, sugars, oils... and there is a separate laundry room, housing new washer and dryer.   I enjoyed the back yard, that was private and there are strands of lights overhead that provide a pleasing ambiance.  There was a TV in the living room and bedroom, which was nice, as well.  The bedroom was a bit dark, for my taste, but cozy.  The one window in it faces to a neighbors driveway, so I never wanted to pull back the curtains.  Comfortable bed, though.  I would stay here again.<br/>",clean
"Comfortable stay! <br/>Blankets were very soft! Shampoo and conditioner was provided- super convenient! The parking is a little tight, but host still accommodated our needs. <br/>Would recommend!",clean
"I will gush. Staying here was nothing less than a HAVEN. The photos depict it perfectly... A lovely little cottage with a beautiful kitchen and back patio for peaceful dinners made at home. We came to LA for work and coming home to Tracy's place was perfect. We bought groceries at the beginning of the week which saved us a lot. We had our own parking spot (rare in LA!) and with all our meetings within 30-45 minutes away (also rare!) because of its proximity to Hollywood, Burbank, Pasadena, etc. it was the perfect landing pad away from the hustle. I will add that Ben the property manager was immediately responsive when I couldn't figure out how to work the garbage disposal and beyond that he even worked graciously through a scenario where I was totally in the wrong (I had booked us one night short of what I thought and couldn't check out when he had new guests coming! Ack!) and even went to the lengths of packing up all our things for us and holding them overnight. Talk about GOING THE EXTRA MILE! Amazing. This whole experience refreshed me on so many levels. Many many thanks. ",location
"My husband and I stayed for an extended period of time while our house was being renovated.  The house is very charming and had everything we needed.  Ben was very attentive and easy to get in touch with.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay.",clean
"We enjoyed our time here. Very nice place for my wife and I to stay for a couple nights. Ben, the property manager was very helpful. Would recommend to anyone.",location
"Very cute home in a quiet area. With our dogs with us, it was nice to have a backyard space for them. It was close to lots of things to do, and we enjoyed the stay! Had a lot of nice features & worked well for us- a couple with two small dogs :) ",location
"I share this account with my fiance, James. We stayed at Tracy's house for three weeks with our three cats. We initially booked the reservation for two weeks while we searched for a home in the area. We extended our reservation for another week. We paid a $500 deposit for our cats. My correspondences were with the Property Manager, Ben, & he was AWESOME. <br/><br/>The first night we were there, one of our cats got out while we were moving in. We were worried sick. We spent a week searching for him (& we found him!). The level of compassion Ben conveyed while we searched for our dear fur baby really made a lasting impression on us. This house is owned by some lovely people. During this search, we got the know the neighbors, who were SO supportive & helpful. Our story ended well & we spent the last two weeks at the house in total comfort.<br/><br/>We truly enjoyed our time at Tracy's house. It had everything we needed: plenty of parking, washer & dryer, & it was not a studio. We appreciated that there was s separate living & bedroom area since we would be with the cats (& our cats love to play at night while their humans are sleeping). Over & beyond what we needed was a LARGE kitchen with full size refrigerator, a bathtub AND shower, a BEAUTIFUL & spacious backyard (we used it for storage), & A LOT OF SPACE to stack our moving boxes. Also, the place was clean, comfortable, & conveniently located. <br/><br/>There is an air conditioner in the bedroom. It works GREAT. There are windows ALL OVER the house (such a plus), so it is easy to keep the house feeling breezy if you do not want to use the air conditioner to cool down. We hooked up our Roku units to both of the televisions, but really, it was not needed. There was plenty to watch without the Roku. The photos don't do the place justice, actually. The layout of the home is ideal.  <br/><br/>By the time it was time to leave, we felt so good about our stay that we did some cleaning so that there would be little or nothing left to clean. We just wanted to show the house some love. We would definitely stay here again. We would recommend anyone who wants to stay here to do so. It was worth every penny. ",location
"This is a great place, perfect for what I was looking for. It is perfect size, GREAT kitchen, lovely back garden, comfortable bed and good bathroom. Wifi works well and it's also great that it has a parking spot. The area is great and basically near everywhere (LA distances). I would totally go back. Communication with Tracy and Ben was perfect. ",location
" This was my first Airbnb experience, and it was an excellent one. Tracy's house was cute as a button and located in a funky little neighborhood with rolling hills, great mom and pop restaurants, and lots of families. Ben (our host) was excellent and promptly answered any questions we had. It was a wonderful experience. Thank you!",location
It's a cute and comfortable home. Tv didn't work but I don't usually watch tv so it wasn't a big deal to me. Will definitely stay again ,clean
"We had a wonderful stay in Tracy's house. The property manager, Ben, is so easy to communicate with and very helpful, he responded promptly to all our concerns, and took care of them as quick as he can. Size of this place is perfect for 2 persons with 2 big luggages like us. It has a big kitchen and a nice backyard which looks so beautiful at night when the outdoor light bulbs are switched on. This house has one air-conditioner in bedroom, during our stay we felt hot in the afternoon, maybe because the weather was extremely hot during these this period , after we told Ben our concern, he sent over a fan to us the next day , the fan helped a lot, we really appreciated that, and we just think the place will be perfectly perfect if there is an air-conditioner in sitting room in summer.",clean
"I spent my holiday with my parents in this cute little house. It was amazing to have our breakfast in the pretty terrace, even if it was sometimes too loud because of the construction site nearby. Ben was very easy to talk with. My last day I could check out without problem a little bit later. This house is perfect for a couple, and if the couch in the living room can be upgraded to a better one, even perfect for 3 people! I personally recommend this cute house.",location
Great communication. Plenty of amenities and fully stocked kitchen. ,location
"It was a quiet neighbor hood!  If u are looking for privacy, thumbs up!<br/>The house is exact as it is!  The place could be slightly warm day time consider at the 80s / 90 temp as the AC is at the bedroom.  The house comes with a very nice kitchen, and backyard.",location
It is a nice little house with spacious kitchen. Easy to park. Very nicely decorated.,clean
"GREAT SPOT!<br/><br/>Perfect little spot.<br/>Everything you could possibly need was there from kitchen to bathroom amenities. It was a super sweet feeling that everything was thought out, also awesome to not have to run to the store for pepper or dish soap. Great location, Great service. Felt like home.<br/>Thank you so much!",location
Great little hideaway. Perfect for 1 person or a couple. Easy access and convenient parking. Extremely close to everything.,location
We really enjoyed this little house. The outside back patio is just perfect for relaxation! ,location
This is such a cute and cozy spot for the short time we were here. I would have loved to take advantage of the patio outdoors- but it was raining on our trip and was kind of cold.  The portable heaters were such a huge help!  Thank you for a wonderful stay!,location

"I loved this little home in Eagle Rock and would definitely stay again.  The photos and listing info are very accurate.  Here's what you won't learn from the listing: the kitchen is seriously well equipped with cooking tools/gadgets.  The bed was so comfortable with soft white linens.  Towels were very nice quality, with extras if you need.  Shampoo, conditioner, and soap from Whole Foods was much appreciated.  Self check in/out was easy, and I was even able to check in a little earlier than the posted time.  There is ample parking in a driveway which runs the length of the home.  I would definitely recommend this AirBnb.",clean
Thank you so much Joshua. We had an amazing stay. The place is super personal and cozy for a group. The hospitality was just right. We really enjoyed our time here.,location
Great place to stay for couple. The yard was great and private.  Had everything from a BBQ to an aero press. Would stay again if I had another extended stay in LA,location
Great place! Really appreciated the large kitchen and comfortable living and bedrooms. Very convenient location and easy parking with the carport. Keyless entry was another huge convenience. Overall stay was perfect - thank you so much for hosting us! ,location

"Great place!  Communication was easy and prompt.  Keyless entry is convenient, as is the location!  Loved our stay!  ",location
"Great house! Feels like home . Clean , comply and homey. We loved it!",clean
"I really enjoyed staying here although my boyfriend wasn't too fond of it. The place is true to the photos posted, it's really small but comfy and I felt at home. <br/>The pros: comfy, clean spot with everything you need and a full nice kitchen. After being a a couple hotels it was nice to have a washer and dryer to use! The backyard was perfect for my daughter to play outside in, the shower head was great and the bed was really comfortable. I was so happy they had Netflix also since I haven't watched tv in forever. Tracy was really quick with getting back to me via airbnb messaging also which was a plus. <br/><br/>Cons: the bathroom is in the bedroom which was weird so if you are staying with friends and not a spouse or relatives it's a bit odd. As soon as we arrived the neighbors were a bit rude and told us not to park in the driveway (it wasn't clear where we should park). The other neighbors have younger guys who constantly drove in and out with loud music so it was kind of annoying while I was trying to study. The bedroom carpet was really stained/dirty and I wasn't comfortable having my daughter walk on it. Lastly and the thing I literally hated the MOST was the curtains they have in the living room. What in the world!! I like privacy and the blinds they have wouldn't close all the way and one wasn't long enough to close all the way so there were cracks for people to see in. There also aren't curtains in the kitchen so I didn't even go in the kitchen at night lol. <br/><br/>Overall nice place and I would definitely stay again!",clean
"A no-frills but pleasant cottage, with a private yard, close to the heart of Eagle Rock and Highland Park... great communication by the host!",location
"Loved our stay in the Eagle Rock house - it was exactly as pictured, very homely and a great place to go home and relax after a long day of exploring. In particular we loved the bathroom, kitchen, full use of laundry and the peaceful little courtyard at the back which was the perfect spot to enjoy the morning sunshine or a family dinner. Would love to come back next time we visit LA.",location

"This is a cute little house on a quiet cul-de-sac in a nice LA neighborhood. It is the perfect size for two people.  The furnishings are nice, and the bedding is soft and comfortable.  We especially loved the full kitchen and the washer and dryer.  The private backyard feels like a little oasis in the heart of the city.  Would definitely recommend!",location

We were there for 5 days and it was super comfortable. We were able to cook a few meals too. Tracy was easy to communicate with and the self-check-in made it easy to get in/lock up.",clean
"We were completely satisfied with the place.  It was quiet, at the end of a small street with off street parking.  It had a nice private small backyard with table. It is almost a ""mini"" house but the 3 of us were comfortable.  One should note that the bathroom is behind the bedroom, so a 3rd person sleeping in the living area on the sofa bed must go through the bedroom to reach the bathroom.  Also, there is a step-down into the bathroom which could be difficult for some with balance issues who might trip in the dark of the night.  We handled it fine, but it wanted people to know about this.  We would stay here again.",location

"This was a lovely little home, nestled in the heart of Eagle Rock, everything was very clean and there was tons of appliances in kitchen for me to cook. I cooked almost everyday. The office in the back was cute too, I didnât get to use this trip but most certainly next time forsure, they even provided a printer! The back Yard was so cute and I loved that there were plenty of towels and two electric heaters in the home. We most certainly will be staying here again, not to mention the price was unbeatable. Thanks Tracy!",clean
We chose this house because of the proximity to our daughter and the fact that it had a nice kitchen for cooking meals for our new mother and granddaughter.  The kitchen was as featured but the rest of the house was tiny - smaller than you would think relative to the kitchen.  The plus side - everything was very clean.  Well equipped kitchen and good shower.  Downside is uncomfortable bed - especially for two people where one had to climb out from being up against a wall.  No drawers for your clothes when you unpack; no live TV.  Location is not quite as lovely as depicted in the pictures but the neighbors are fine and there is parking.  Best for a single person with few clothes.  There is also a sofa bed in the living area but if you opened it up it would block the bedroom doorway.  Very tiny.  Tracy was very responsive to our questions about getting the TV working but we were never able to get it to connect.,clean
"Easy, easy check in.   Quick responses to questions.  The neighborhood was very friendly, lots of people out and about in the morning and evening.   I felt very safe when walking the dog after dark.   While the place is quite small, it was exactly what we needed as a ""landing pad"" after babysitting our 4 month old grandson all day.   It is close to a lot of local restaurants and easy to get around being near Eagle Rock  and York Blvd.  I had been concerned about noise from freeway and apartments nearby, but, absolutely no issues.   Nice little backyard space for a quiet glass of wine in the evening.",location
"We had a great stay. Super easy to check in with a code for access to the place, and Anne was very responsive in getting us all set up with everything.

"Tracyâs place has greatly impacted my and my boyfriendâs first trip to LA and had made it a truly memorable one. The location of the house is in a relatively quiet neighborhood with stores and restaurants within a walking distance. The house is smaller than what the pictures depict, but it is absolutely perfect for a couple and an extra person at most. Everything was clean and tidy when we got to the house with a fresh smell being present. The backyard had a little office which was useful and a table outside which made it a comfortable place to relax anytime during the day or evening. The amenities were great, I felt that everything necessary and more was provided during our stay. The garage has multiple huge spaces therefore parking was always blissful. The property manager Anne consistently kept in contact with me and made sure all of my questions and concerns were addressed. As this was also my first time using AirBnb I can truthfully say that Tracy and Anne were the ideal host & property manager. Overall we felt very comfortable and had a hard time leaving the cozy home. Would definitely recommend Tracyâs place to anybody looking to stay in LA!",clean

"Tracyâs place is very cute clean and homey. The small house yet spaciously adequate for two has a complete kitchen set, big fridge,  spacious kitchen, free washing and drying machines with all amenities provided and freshly cleaned, complete with Netflix and two TVs. Water pressure was good, aircon is cool and nice. The well kept backyard would host a bbq gathering nicely. We had a good time, felt at home. The neighborhood is very safe, and private. We thank the host and Alice whoâs available and very responsive. Recommended if youâre looking for a quiet nice comfy space. Takes around 15-20 min drive to Hollywood / central, $14-18 by Uber. But there are Rite Aid resto and shops nearby within walking 5-10 min walking distance for groceries and food. We had a pleasant lovely stay.",clean
"Nice place, easy access.  Great kitchen.  Off street parking is always a plus in Los Angeles!! Tracy was very responsive to the small ""maintenance"" type issues we contacted her about.",clean
"This was a sweet doll house and I say doll house it being only 467 square feet.  The appointments were nice and the house was impeccably clean.  For me it was an ideal  location as I was working downtown and thus it was close to the 2 freeway which took me straight there.  If there was AC throughout it would be more ideal,  I arrived July 4 in the middle of the heatwave and inside the house it was over 90.  The only resource was to escape to the bedroom where there was airconditioning - but no space to work there - only a bed with a TV on the wall.   I loved the idea of working in the outside back building (a kind of hut)  however that was a sauna also and I gather recently painted, as the chemical smells were intense.  Anne the host, stayed in good communication.  ",clean
Perfect for 2-3 people but probably no more than that. Keep windows open during day when youâre there if itâs cool enough to help cool down the place. Very nice and updated space. Check in was a breeze and having parking is convienent. Great spot in town close to freeways to get to where ever youâre headed. Thank you Tracy we enjoyed our stay and would return if I needed a place in LA again! ,clean

Check in process was super easy and Anne and Tracy were great with getting back to me right away if I had any questions.  Although the location is not ideal for tourists or travelers without cars, itâs great for those who have friends and family in the area. Also loved that I was able to have my dogs with me.  Would love to stay here when visiting LA again. Highly recommend it.",location
"Tracy's sweet little house is great for solo travelers or couples, mayyyybe three people, tops. While this place is tiny in size, it does not lack in amenities. The kitchen is spacious and leads into a great little backyard with a BBQ and small separate office space. It was a great compound for my BF and our little doggo for a relaxing week in LA and was centrally located with quick freeway access. Parking can be tricky if you have more than one vehicle or invite a guest over, but otherwise, this is a great place and great value!",location
"Nice, clean, cozy house at the end of a small quiet block.  Everything in the house was nice and comfortable, nice private backyard and separate detached little office area with printer. Canât beat a free standing house with backyard and a drive on the side for parking. Not far from at from the city, the pups and I loved it. Thanks again Tracy.",clean
"Perfect house in a great location! Easy access with property manager available for any issues via text, almost immediately. You are able to park in the driveway, and are only a few steps to the front or backdoor. The house is very clean and organized with anything you would ever need while on a trip. Beautiful enclosed backyard, which is perfect for a nice BBQ or all meals. You have a major department store literally right around the corner, and a variety of other shops as well. Everything L.A. has to offer, you are right in the center and only 10 to 15 minutes away from any event or venue. The street and entire neighborhood are quiet and very safe to walk, even late at night. I would highly recommend this house for a mini-vacation or extended stay.",location
"A lovely place! Fantastic outdoor space, very cute decor.",location
We loved our stay. Very cute and cozy space. Perfect for my small family. The location was very central which made it also very convenient.,location
A group of friends and I stayed here for a short trip to LA. The driveway parking was really convenient and there was great communication if we were ever blocked in by another guest. Shower was a little difficult to set at a non extreme temperature,location
Great location and house!,location
"Lovely place to stay for a couple or (as in our case) a couple with a baby. Quite location close to supermarkets, Griffith park, Universal Studios, LA Zoo and many other places.",location
Kitchen amenities are amazing! And the host is easy to connect with. Great spot to come back to after being out and about for the day.,location
Wonderful place! Great stay! Would definitely stay again.,location
"This is the perfect place to call home while on a trip to LA. Itâs in a very convenient location near the freeway and is a complete home with a backyard, washer/dryer, and a great kitchen with all amenities. There is a âcommunalâ parking lot next to the house that visitors should be aware of. Also, the street that it is located on feels more like  an alley rather than a Main Street. Easy check in and check out. we enjoyed the stay.",location
"Great spot! Stayed for a week while on a work trip, would come back and stay again.",location
"Very cool Eagle Rock experience!! We stayed here for a week and really enjoyed the space, the location - a really great value!",location
"Disclaimer: long time Airbnb user. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Pros: Tracyâs house is cute. Location is close to freeway. There is a backyard with table, bbq and cute lighting, and a spare office. The kitchen is high spec. Self checkin and checkout. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Cons: the listing is managed by an agency. Tracy lives abroad. We were checking out from a 1st Airbnb at 11am, Tracyâs listing calendar showed as available the night before our checkin, so nobody should be in there. We explained our situation and kindly asked for an early checkin and the agency refused as guests were checking out, which I found strange since an agency is supposed to manage the calendar. I showed up 2 hours early, the place was clean and empty, ready for us to checkin. Blinds are not working, some donât close, some donât open. Blinds that donât close are on the front side of the house, so your business is exposed to the neighbors. My wife didnât feel secure, so we shared our concern with the agency and they kindly offered to send a handyman. No one showed up and the agency never followed up, even though we kindly asked for updates. The bedding is old, the mattress and the bed are old, the sheets are in synthetic, so not the most enjoyable and resting nights of sleep. The backyard has not been cleaned in a long time, so I cleaned it so we could have our meals outside. There is no dishwasher in the kitchen.",location
"(MUST READ) I arrived at Tracyâs place around 5:30pm, their check in time is 3:00pm on Airbnb. When I arrived, the house was dirty and messy, the house wasnât ready for us at all. Terrible!! I was shocked when I saw the house. I contact the host immediately, she did not answer the first call, then I message them. She called back immediately, she said she will send someone over to clean the house otherwise she will come over by herself. After few minutes, she message me that the cleaner will be here at 6:30pm and will clean the house really quick. I was like: uh? An unclean house, I expect unless you need to wash and dry the bed sheet(because obviously the last guest left the house in this morning and those two bed was dirty), clean up the kitchen and restroom. I donât think the cleaner can finish this work within one or two hours. We drove eight hours all the way down from tucson to LA. When can we stay and relax? Plus my little dog is next to me, can you imagine that? When we left, the time was 6:34pm, did not see anyone come by the house. Almost one hundred per night wasnât expensive but also not cheap. Lots of mosquitos in the house and back yard, summer time. They should have double check with their cleaner before their guest arrived. They told me they are human, sometimes things happened.( for me, this is not a excuse that you can said to your guest. Iâm not living here for free.) they really seems not that responsible for me. I booked with them  because I saw lots of good reviews on their reviews. but now I have to think about it before I book my next trip on Airbnb. Super disappointed",clean
"After seeing a few concerning reviews we were a bit nervous before our stay, but I can honestly say it looks like any issues have been fixed and I would highly recommend this cute bungelow as a place to stay for an extended period in LA. I've been in LA many times, but never in northeast LA and loved the Highland Park, Eagle Rock and Mt Washington neighborhoods. The house is a short drive or scooter ride from many neighborhood restaurants, bars and coffee shops and also very easy access to Downtown LA, Los Feliz and Pasadena. There were a few minor issues like the wifi not extending to the back office the sheets being a bit too small for the bed and the street includes many very loud barking dogs, but my partner, dog and I were very comfortable and if we need a place to stay in northeast LA again will definitely consider this place again.",location
"After a 2.5 week stay, I would alert anyone staying during the summer that the house gets quite hot. The a/c unit is in the bedroom only and the average temperature in the rest of the house between 4 and 10pm was 90-95 degrees. There are a couple of box fans that can be set up, but it remains quite stuffy until late at night. It was not feasible to open windows for cross flow of air because a few windows didn't have screens, or had screens that weren't sealed. A simple fix of those would make things more comfortable. If you're staying in the fall/winter, the temperature wouldn't be such an issue. <br/><br/>Other than that, the house was as described. The kitchen is very spacious; it was great to have a washer/dryer in the unit; the back patio is nice in the evenings; and the location near the freeways is convenient.",clean
"The home is located at the end of a cul de sac, so, no traffic or noise.   The neighbors are super friendly, one of them remembered us from the last time we stayed there.   While the neighborhood is ""hilly"", I love walking around, I feel very safe.   This is the first time we stayed in the heat of summer, and it took some time to cool the place down when we first arrived.   There is an air conditioning unit in the bedroom, so we just shut the bedroom door and it was cooled down by the time we went to bed.  There are also some fans and good cross ventilation, so it was easy to cool it down once the sun went down.     In the winter the late afternoon sun is a ""bonus"".   We love the decor, on the artsy side, and the kitchen, while well equipped seldom gets used by us....we love the restaurants on York and Eagle Rock.  While it is an older home with small spaces, it is clear that there is a pride of ownership.",location
"As described in the AirBnB, it was as expected. Although we didn't get to meet him. The town was nearby most of the places.",clean
Nice bungalow in Eagle Rock.,location
Tracyâs place was a wonderful little house to stay at while visiting LA. The place  is exactly as the description says and is super close to everything you would want to visit in LA.,location
Great price for LA. Short drive to downtown and universal.,location
Absolutely lovely. I would stay here again :),location
"Will be coming back, perfect location.",location
"Super clean with thoughtful touches. The only drawback was we were there in cold weather and the house was chilly despite a space heater. The neighbor Pete was friendly and made us feel like he kept an eye on the place, which was reassuring. Contact with Anne was great...she was very responsive.",clean
"We rented this house for 2 months and what a gem! It was the perfect space for us and my young family's needs and we were super impressed with how quiet and comfortable it was (despite being super close to a freeway) and how well appointed the kitchen is (learn to cook a french tart?!). This is in an authentic L.A. neighborhood, a safe one with quality taco and pupusa stands nearby.  <br/><br/>Like a lot of places in L.A. the home does not have central heat or A/C so expect to need extra layers or cold plunges the times of year the weather's not perfect (generally Dec-Jan for cold and Jul-Oct for hot). The hosting agency was a little slow in response time but was accommodating of all of our needs and the odd emergency.  <br/><br/>The close proximity to the 2 freeway made it easy to jet up into the mountains for hikes, Pasadena or Glendale for lunch or out to Malibu for the beach (1 hr drive) as well as being relatively close to Griffith Park and Downtown. Loved the Penny Oven (breakfast spot) and doing yoga at One Down Dog up the street on Colorado. A car is definitely recommended as Target is really the only thing within easy walking distance.",location
Amazing host & stay!,host
Place was very cozy it is a nice safe area up a hill. It was very nice to sit outside without having to wear a mask due to covid-19,location
"Tracy's spot was super cozy and such a wonderful experience! My son and pup were able to be free in the secure backyard while I worked in the office out back, the space was very quiet despite it being so close to everything and the neighbors we met were amazing! Loved having dinner outside, the lighting was magical. If you're looking for a space to unwind, while also getting work done or even a dream project this is your spot! Super kid friendly and the spacious kitchen was a bonus! Will be back if the occasion calls for it!",location
"This place is fine, nothing more and nothing less. It was a great location for someone from the area needing an option for a couple weeks but the house is dark, doesn't have climate control, and wasn't the cleanest place I've ever been.",location
"This place was a good size for my husband and I and our dogs. For a long stay I think 3 people would be a squeeze, but could be fine for a weekend stay. It gets really hot, but we expected that based on the other reviews. Sleeping ended up being very comfortable there with the AC on as well as the fan. The bed was super comfortable as well (and I donât usually sleep well away from my house!). Having the TV in the bedroom as well was nice, giving us a cooler space to watch netflix. Our only real complaint is that they advertise the outdoor space as usable, but it was so covered in filth it took multiple wipe downs and cleaning products to get the tables close to being usable. I will say Anne the property manager was very sweet and had I told her about the issue earlier Iâm sure they would have sent someone to clean it, but since I work from home and was staying there with dogs it would have been inconvenient. All that said, aside from one small area in the bathroom, the rest of the place was very clean and ready to be used - the kitchen is very spacious and the fridge is large so if you like to cook at home itâs great.",location
This place is right in the middle of Korea-town and not far AT ALL from most tourist attractions in LA.  Comfortable beds and place all around.  Joshua was super quick with replying and helped us out with anything we needed.  Another plus is the driveway parking!  It is tandem but helps when youâve been out all day sightseeing and just wanna pull into a driveway and relax.  I will definitely keep this place in mind on my next LA visit!,location
Love that it was located at the end of a small cul-de-sac. Everything went smooth for the 4 days that I stayed here. I would stay again.,clean
"Awesome place to work from for 2 weeks! Loved the backyard, too and great communication from the host. Iâd definitely stay again.",location
The place is absolutely great! The neighborhood is amazing! However it does get quite hot during the day the A/C is only in the bedroom. We were out during the day though so it wasnât that big of a deal.,location
Tracyâs place was cozy and clean! We had an enjoyable stay.,clean
Great little oasis in Eagle Rock. The house is tucked away on a quiet side street and I really loved the back patio and work studio.,location

Very clean and quiet place I had everything I needed I felt just  like home.,clean
It was a great experience.. plus it was in the middle of everything..,location
Nice little house in a quiet neighborhood. The lot neighbors a tractor trailer where sometimes people work out of. But nothing bothered me. There is a driveway and a car port to keep your car out of the sun. Back yard office was a great touch! And really enjoyed having a printer (with ink!) which can be a rarity. Target down the street and lots of food delivery available.,location
"As advertised in the reviews. Property manager very responsive. Very nice stay. Nice little backyard to have meals, relax outside.",location
The kitchen and laundry room were exactly what we needed. Back space was great for work.,clean

Very friendly and extremely comfortable guest house,clean
The backyard and office setup are great but thatâs about where any positivity ends for me at this place. The house is very rundown and doesnât look much like the photos at all. The bathroom is especially dismal with disgusting black mold missing caulk paint a tub in disrepair rusty light fixture and a stained and mildewed shower curtain. The sheets on the bed were 100% bargain basement room essentials sheets from Target with old yellowed pillows. Theyâre really charging the most with this and doing the least in terms of upkeep and cleaning. The kitchen cabinets were full of old cookware and spices that shouldâve been thrown away. Nowhere to put groceries or any of my things for my longer stay. All the furniture has worn out itâs welcome. Iâd strongly think twice before staying here longer than a couple days. I want my money back.,clean
"Overall positive experience.<br/><br/>The property is well-maintained. The house was clean with fresh towels and sheets. Anne, the property manager, was extremely kind and responsive during the stay.<br/><br/>The size of the house is small, but worked for two people. My girlfriend and I wanted to stay in a quiet neighborhood outside of LA and this place fit our needs perfectly. Thereâs a car lot for parking a car if you have one. The backyard is also a nice to have during the stay. The location is also close to the highway if youâre traveling around LA. Both my girlfriend and I work from home and needed to do so for a couple of days during our stay. We had no problems with wifi and were both able to take our video calls with no disruption.<br/><br/>We did have a bit of an issue with mosquitoes/gnats during the stay. I believe part of the problem was due to the back door window not closing all the way. It does seem to be on the radar of the property manager though, because a pest control person did stop by the house to spray for mosquitoes while we were there. Anne was very responsive about this during the stay, so Iâm hoping/expecting this problem to be fixed.<br/><br/>We also had an issue with the backyard string lights, but Anne sent a handyman the next day to fix things and it was no longer a problem.<br/><br/>If youâre looking for something cozy in a quiet neighborhood, I would recommend.",location
"Overall the place is great! Loved having the backyard for our pup to hang out in, and the back office is also perfect if youâre working from home.  Did get  leaten alive by mosquitoes out there so come prepared. <br/>The main thing was the WiFi was pretty bad for two of us working remote. Also the unit is at the end of a cul de saq which is pretty quiet, except for the gauntlet of barking dogs you have to walk past if you plan on walking around especially if you have a dog.  We stayed for a month at it is super convenient to get to Highland Park and York street.",location

Good location and parking!,location
Great place awesome neighborhood quiet and a good central location close to lots of stuff,location
"Had a great stay at this precious little tiny home. Loved the separate work area, the backyard, off-street parking, etc. It is fairly narrow in the home, but that's to be expected of tiny houses! Had everything we needed (laundry room and huge kitchen was such a delight) and would absolutely stay again! Very quaint street with a lot of neighbors nearby, but we never experienced much neighbor noise at all. One thing to note is that there was a visit from both an exterminator and LADWP. I was not notified of either in advance and both parties let themselves in the backyard to do their work, but luckily my dogs were inside of the home at the time so there were no issues. Thanks again Tracy & Co.!",clean
"Great communication and easy stay, good location, lovely yard!",location
Tracy and her team are A+! So communicative and kind about all the details. They response quickly and thoughtfully and made sure we had a great stay!,clean
"Everything besides the neighbor was great. Neighborhood is a bit sketchy and one neighbor in particular is very nasty and scary. Otherwise the host was great, the place was very cute and we didnât have any other issues besides the neighbor. I wouldnât stay there again just because of the neighbor and the neighborhood.",host
I had a lovely stay. I would stay here again. It is exactly as advertised.,clean
"A great little house in a quiet neighborhood!  Beautiful kitchen and patio to relax on.  Tons of nearby places for food and drinks, and it was the perfect spot to catch a ride from to the Rose Bowl!",location
a great spot that is super convenient to great neighborhoods. <br/><br/>the place is small but the space is totally comfortable and easy with a parking spot and a nice fenced backyard. really great for a couple. <br/><br/>really a great value for such a good location.,location
"Tracyâs place was really close to everything and super central. There was an issue with mosquitos in the backyard throughout most of the stay except the last few days when it was cooler. Mosquito repellent only went so far unfortunately. I was told itâs sprayed by a company so thatâs good. We were staying for two weeks so having supplies in the Airbnb for the duration of our paid stay was important and Anne, the property manager, was very kind about that. As a guest who has stayed there, I would suggest putting in an air cooler or ac in the small front room in the summers for guests bc it does get quite hot and warm with 2 fans blowing air. So be aware of that in the summers at least. But that may be more of a logistical thing for the Airbnb and one for me to choose an Airbnb with full ac everywhere for next time. Otherwise it was a nice spot and the patio, minus the mosquitos, was lovely.",clean
"Tracyâs 1b1b home is closed to a lot of good place between LA and Pasadena. And it is also closed to the Koreatown which is  the ocean of good East Asian restaurants. The price of the room itself is reasonable. And Tracyâs co-host proactively reached out to provide thoughtful check-in/check-out guidance. The cleaning service might need some improvements, after all 100 dollars cleaning fee should at least make sure the dryer is not full of wet rinsed sheets.",location
"Space was smaller than expected , cozy none the less",clean
Good stay. Quiet and private. Nice private patio area for hanging outside. Close to everything in NELA.,location
You can put anything from the previous note here.,location

"Location is close to a major road but feels very quiet and secluded.  They allowed me to check in a few minutes early, and I unpacked in a clean and climate-controlled house.  It was a hot day, so I really appreciated the house being pre-cooled.<br/><br/>The private back yard is another nice secluded spot, surrounded by greenery which I enjoyed.  I was quite comfortable for my entire stay and would book this listing again.",location

Ann & Jeff were very nice hosts and always helped out when help was needed. The interior is colorful and cozy and we had a lot of fun going through their music collection. I would definitely recommend this place, but only for people that are fit climbing a few stairs :-) thanks again Ann & Jeff",clean
"The fruit trees, incredible views, and hillside setting all make this house feel a little bit magical. As long as you can handle stairs, this is a place for you. The two separate offices and outdoor space make it very livable for a couple or young family. We spent over a month in this beautiful home, it's equipped with everything you need for a longterm stay.",location
"This place was honestly such a little oasis! Surrounded by fruit trees, hummingbirds, and beautiful mountain views - lots of great restaurants and shops are a short walk away - just as long as you don't mind a few stairs and hills (it's really worth it)! <br/><br/>The house had all the amenities you could think of and definitely felt like a little home away from home - I loved looking at all the art books and listening to music from their awesome record collection!",location
"Tucked away on a cozy block, walking to cafes. It's a place with character and history, a much loved home. It is a perfect spot to have an outdoor dinner with a couple of friends or family. The bed is super cozy with a great view. The kitchen is great  for cooking. Be sure you are okay with steps before booking, but it's worth the climb.",location
Great location! Loved the juicy lemons in the yard. Great views. Lots of stairs as Ann advised so be prepared. Home has a private feel in the middle of the city.,location

"The guest house is independent and has parking available which are the features that made me book it. Also Joshua was kind enough to allow a late check-out. It has a nice TV with HDMI cable to hook your phone or iPad for Netflix or Hulu. Having said that, the room feels a little bit dated and the shower needs some deep cleaning. The curtain had mold and dirt stuck to it.",clean
I really loved the house. The location was great. It was super close to all of the places I visited. The sun room is definitely my favorite part of the house. The view from that room is beautiful. I loved spending afternoons in there. The garden was very peaceful too. Ann was also very nice and responded quickly making my stay very convenient. Would not hesitate to stay here again.,location
"A wonderful place to stay, everything I hoped it would be. The views are incredible and it is very peaceful. The DASH bus stops around the corner and there's lots of bus lines on Sunset and Alvarado, or you can even walk to downtown (which I did!). I stayed for a week without a car and had no problems. The steps aren't a problem unless you have mobility issues.",location
"Ann was an exceptional host, very helpful, communicative, and kind. Neighbors were nice and the house is like a dreamy urban treehouse. I highly recommend this place. I heard wildlife and yet I was in the heart of a wonderful urban scene. I wanted for nothing in the home- I played records, cooked meals, read. Poms in the sunroom, and sat on the porch. Such a gem!",location
What a wonderful little LA tree house! We had a great stay - everything was as described. Host was super communicative and the home was just lovely. Would absolutely stay here again!,location

"Wow, Ann's place is really an oasis. I worked remotely here for two weeks to escape winter on the East Coast and it was truly worth it. The house is just the right size for two, there is plenty of space â whether you're working or relaxing. The front porch is a lovely escape, I took all my meetings with hummingbirds buzzing around my head. The kitchen is fully equipped for cooking, and Echo Park is in such a great, central location. We were able to get everywhere we wanted with ease. Ann was super available and responsive throughout our stay.",location
"Ann and Jeffâs home felt like a home away from home. For us, a small family of three (two adults and a 15 month old), it was perfect. Ample space, cosy areas to hang out, and one of the best work desks for my husband and I to do work-from-home. Personally for me, the best experiences on Airbnb are when you get to share in the homey vibe your hosts lovingly created for themselves. Ann and Jeffâs home is the epitome of the best of this. Highly recommended and looking forward to our return.",location
"This quirky unit has a lot of character. It's obviously the host's actual home as opposed to some unit that's primarily just rented out. The kitchen is well stocked with essentials. It would be absolutely perfect for a couple who both work from home. There's one bedroom as well as two separate office spaces. The WiFi is super fast (200 mbps up and downstream) and the bed was very comfortable. Washer and dryer worked great. It's also relatively quiet for being in such a dense neighborhood.<br/><br/>The unit is up a HUGE flight of stairs so it's not a good selection for anyone with mobility issues or a lot of luggage. I'm an athlete and I occasionally found it challenging when carrying something heavy or when the weather was hot. The unit does have AC, but I had some trouble cooling it down when the weather got up into the 90s.",location
"Ann's place is an absolutely perfect retreat in Echo Park, that is still close to everything in LA and in a fun neighbourhood to explore. I stayed for nearly two weeks, and the house has everything you might need for an extended stay.  The garden (and neighbouring gardens!) is absolutely incredible, and a real highlight of the place. Ann was also super responsive to any of my questions and resolved issues (which were very minor!) quickly. Highly recommend.",location
"Absolutely gorgeous house, probably one of the best experiences Iâve had on 11 years using Airbnb. Beautiful home ideally located in beautiful Echo Park. The garden has lemon trees and a very nice terrace, the house has a very peaceful vibe, thereâs a great record collection and an upright piano. The view from the bedroom window is just stunning. <br/>Thereâs stairs to climb before accessing the house so I probably wouldnât recommend it to older people, aside from that it is perfect ! Thank you Ann and Jeff for having us in your beautiful home.",location
"We had a wonderful stay at Casa Lucretia, a beautifully designed space, comfortable bed and very well-stocked kitchen. everything is as described, and a brand new AC had just been installed when we moved in. It is very private, you can sit on the terrace surrounded by birds and greenery, high above the traffic with a great view. Neighbors were also very quiet. The house is very pleasant and nicely set up with lots of space, comfortable chairs and good storage facilities. Yes, there are a lot of steps to get up there, and lugging the bags on that first day was not easy. But we had been warned so came prepared and for us it was most certainly worth it, not least because of the relative quiet and privacy that is otherwise hard to come by in LA Airbnbs. Location was perfect for us, as we mostly moved around DTLA., Hollywood and the Eastside. The surrounding area is also great, close to local cafÃ©s, restaurants, shops etc. Communication with Ann and Jeff was fast and excellent also. Strongly recommended, we will be back for sure.",location
"This is our second time staying at Ann's home. We very rarely repeat Airbnb experiences, so this already speaks volumes to how comfortable and happy we are with her lovely home. You can read my previous review on more of the specifics of how her home makes us feel very much at home. Thank you again for the opportunity to stay and we can only highly recommend Ann's home to any potential visitors.",host

This listing is at the perfect location if you want to explore Koreatown!  We were able to walk to some great restaurants and hangout spots.  The beds were also super comfortable.,location
"I highly recommend Joshua's place. He is a great host and offers a wonderful stay. Everything was perfect, very clean, comfortable, safe, nice patio and amazing central location for checking out LA. I definitely would return and recommend Joshua's Airbnb :)",clean
TV didnât work but otherwise great space and would recommend.,space
Great house ðdefinitely come back if I travel to LA,location
"For the price and location it was worth the night stays. This was my first time going out of my comfort zone. The only concerns  I had were the bathroom shower curtain was moldy, towels needed replacing, firecrackers going off both nights stay, having to shuffle vehicles (leave your keys in the main house for others to move) and not have a working tv. Our two nights only consisted of sleeping and for that it was good. The bed and linens were acceptable, again for the price it was acceptable. The perks are you are in Korean Town and there are a lot of restaurants. You are not far from Hollywood and Universal Studios, this was our reason for stay. Our host wasn't available but Jason was on hand for all our needs, he did go out of his way to make our stay comfortable. I gave this a 3 Star.",clean
Would stay again good for a group of 4 or 5,clean
"Great area, great price right around the corner from everything.",location
"This place is a perfect spot to spend the night. Check-in is easy, and the guesthouse is quiet and laid back. The parking was easy enough, he will  offer to park your car for easy access into the long parkway. Street parking is claustrophobic. The bathroom shower curtains are a bit dirty on the bottom, but the bathroom itself was fine. There are the two beds listed but a couch is also in the guesthouse as well. Overall, solid stay!",clean
"Casual, welcoming guest home with privacy. Hosts were superb. Being able to walk to a bunch of shops, cafes and restaurants was a HUGE PLUS. Josh is amazing and will help you figure out whatever you need. Safe area, friendly people. We had so much fun THANK YOU!",location
"It was a nice and complete appartement we loved it. Everything was well equiped. Tennisrackets, basketbal and access  for pool... We realy enjoyed it",location
"We had a wonderful stay. The apartment is beautiful, well equipped, and very well located. The neighborhood his fantastic, you can enjoy the  pool and beach is very close. <br/>Maria has done a fantastic job to make sure we enjoy our stay.",location
"My wife and I (as well as our dog!) stayed at Maria's apartment in Playa Vista for 8 nights after driving across the country to move to Los Angeles.  We needed a place to stay before our lease started, and Maria's place was PERFECT.  We could not have asked for a better host or apartment to fit our needs.  Everything is exactly as advertised and Maria has though of everything to make her guests feel at home.  She is also very responsive and detailed when communicating. The bed is super comfortable, the building and surrounding area are the cleanest and safest in Los Angeles, and don't even get me started on the massive TV!  The coffee maker that Maria had wasn't working so I let her know - if it had ended there it would have been fine but Maria went above & beyond and ordered a new one that arrived a day later.  Talk about service!  I highly recommend Maria's apartment if you are looking for a place to stay on the west side. ",host
Maria is a very nice host and very responsive ! She answered all our enquires quickly! The flat provides all essentials and you will definitely feel like home at Maria's flat. The surrounding is quiet with nice neighborhood and you can find supermarkets around. It is very close to beaches and airport. ,location
"This place was amazing! Great location for relaxing and enjoying the beaches near LA. It seemed like we were in the center of LA while also being close to the airport. It's right next to a LA Fitness and there are a number of running trails right outside that makes it ideal for staying up with exercise.<br/><br/>The beach is right down the street surrounded by a bunch of nice restaurants. There's a Whole Foods up the street too if you want to stay in and cook.<br/><br/>As for the place itself, it felt just like home. Any man will love the huge flat screen TV for watching college football. The neighborhood looked beautiful, and we found a hammock nearby in the residential area which my girlfriend and I both loved.<br/><br/>I definitely would consider coming back to this place the next time I'm in LA!",location
"everything was great - exactly as described , thx Maria",clean
"Maria was very responsive and provided all the amenities a guest could want! Very cozy, quiet, and family-friendly.  Walking distance to market and restaurants.  Great playground a few blocks away.  Will definitely consider staying there again!",location
"This was my best experience on Airbnb! The place was beautiful, in a awesome location/neighborhood, and the bed was super comfortable. <br/>Maria was super easy to reach and communicate with. Checking in and out was a breeze. I can't say enough about this rental!! I highly recommend staying here. ",location
"Communication with Maria was very easy. She did not meet us when we checked in, but here instructions for getting access was very clear and detailed. The apartment is very clean, modern and is in a great convenient location. Playa Vista has a lot of free Summer activities like outdoor movies and concerts. We were sad that we couldn't take advantage of that since it wasn't quite Summer yet. Parking is super easy both in the garage and on the street. <br/><br/>This is a great alternative for a Silicon Beach business trip and some fun on the side :-)",clean
Maria was so kind. She was very responsive and attentive throughout the booking process. She greeted us in person at our check in time with the keys. Her place was very clean and comfortable to stay in. The location is in a newer development and was about a 5 minute drive to both the Marina and the beach. There were lots of dining option within a 5 minute drive as well. We felt very comfortable and safe in her place. We would recommend anyone to stay here. ,clean
"Maria was quick to respond to any questions.<br/>The condo was as described and in an ideal location to reach Marina Del Rey, Venice Beach, and the Santa Monica pier. As well as LAX and Loyola Marymount University.<br/><br/>We walked to coffee each morning and enjoyed the neighborhood.",location
"Maria was very helpful and responsive. Her apartment was great. It's cozy, clean, and well-appointed with everything you could want for a nice getaway. ",clean
"Room is clean, well equiped with everything you need. The host was very accommodating  and even let us do early check in. Will definitely comeback here again.",clean
"Joshuaâs airbnb and service was beyond what we expected for our stay. It was a beautiful place and we had a great time, anytime we head over to L.A we know where we plan to stay!(-:",location
Maria's home is wonderful. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The four of us had plenty of space to sleep in the couch bed and master room. Having access to a full kitchen really improved our weekend. Her bathroom is also amazingly stocked with beach and bath items! So many towels and Eco shampoo and conditioner for guests! We were not expecting so much! There was a hiccup with the lock box! We'd never used one before and couldn't reach her. But the minute she was able to get back to us she was very responsive! There was also a lot of dust in the couch bed pillows and blankets which affected our allergies. But we let her know so she could discuss with her cleaning crew. Other than that it was a wonderful experience and we are grateful to have been welcomed into her home! ,clean
"Joshua was a cool hip guy, definitely gave us good info on the area. The host was noninvasive but was very accessible when we needed him. A great place to stay, would recommend 10/10.ð",location
"My family loved our stay, basic clean room, great location - I was able to get to many locations (beach, Hollywood, downtown) in 30 minutes or less. There was free parking in a single wide driveway - just leave your keys in the house so all the vehicles can be shuffled around.",clean
"My stay here was awesome. The place was really convenient for my needs, quiet, and well kept. Erika was available when I kind of had an issue with the personal parking spots late at night. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay here.",clean
Very clean place with responsive host team and great amenities. Would definitely stay there again!,clean
"Well, it was a place to sleep? <br/>The shower curtains were moldy, <br/>The host wanted my private phone number, and was asked to give him my car keys, <br/>Less than ideal, but i slept fine?",clean
"Joshua's place was clean and comfortable, and he was a great host.",clean
"Our stay was okay. The location was good, and our communication with Jason was great. He was also able to let us check in early, which was really helpful for us. The place was spacious enough, although the bathroom was not particularly clean. We also were not informed about laundry, although I believe there is a laundry machine outside.<br/><br/>One trouble we had was with the parking situation. The driveway is long and can fit several cars, however, the cars block each other in, so youâre required to place your keys in a communal area so your car can be moved if needed. Alternately, street parking is available however every night we were not able to get street parking. Jason was very helpful in moving cars blocking our car at 5 am before our flight. However, it made me very nervous to be in this situation rather than having a normal parking spot.",clean
Great location!,location
The host was great and so helpful.  He found parking for everyone behind the gated driveway and moved the cars around in the morning so that we could sleep in.  There are multiple places at this location and it was nice to meet the other guests. The place is in a great location.  Korea-town. There is so much to do in the area.,location
This was the first Airbnb on my own so I was a little nervous. Joshua was very accommodating on my arrival due to getting in late. The place was clean and the location was perfect between visiting friends and family. I would definitely stay here again.,clean
"Great place, friendly host. Description is very accurate. I would for sure come back!",clean
"I stayed in this lovely apartment with my fiance for seven days. In my opinion the apartment is perfect and comfortable enough for two people. Erika was nice enough to message me the instructions to get into the place since she couldn't be there. The kitchen was stocked with pots and small things that helped making cooking easier for us. We did head to Vons for groceries. She also provided towels and small shampoos. <br/>I do have to point out that if you are not from California and looking to check out hollywood and the beaches, make note that it is pretty far from the area. The estimate time is around 50 minutes because there is mostly always traffic on the freeway. We did bring our car so it wasn't too much trouble but we always had to leave an hour earlier. Nothing close by besides local groceries and a few places to eat.<br/>We enjoyed the convience of having a pool and jacuzzi, which we used every night. Also we used the TV for movie night but during our stay the Netflix was logged out of, luckily we had our own account. Also the bathroom had an awesome heating power to keep warm after the shower. <br/>The patio was dirty and there were no chairs or table to sit and enjoy the beautiful weather. But that was the only minor fallback from this beautiful place.",clean
Cool place and host.,location
"Very nice, clean a good place to stay. I would stay again",clean
Josh was so great! He is very helpful and so nice! Parking might be a little tough but Josh is so willing to accommodate! His place also had all the amenities you need!,location
"Positives-<br/>My boyfriend and I stayed for a month in this beautiful apartment. We greatly appreciated the instructions to get to the apartment along with a welcome pack that enlisted Wi-Fi access codes and suggested places to visit during our stay.  <br/><br/>The apartment is perfect for two! Extremely clean in all rooms however, when entering the back terrace it needed attention. Perhaps a table or sun lounger would be great to use as an alternative to staying at the pool during the day.  Throughout our stay we noticed the grounds men blowing away the dried leaves and debris from the garden pathway every other day. After I had swept the first time round the mess did return. So it is at no means the hostâs fault for not tending to the back terrace.  <br/><br/>The apartment is very spacious with a great AC system to keep us cool during this hot summer. The kitchen was great, pots and baking trays where provided along with plates and cutlery. The bed is extremely comfortable! Extra bedding was provided along with fresh towels, shampoos, and an iron.  Netflix was great but we would suggest having cable TV as another option for entertainment. <br/><br/>The apartment was a little out of reach of the grocery stores but you can easily access the buses, Metro and Uber to get to them. It was mega hot to walk back and forth to get to the stores which is around a twenty-minute walk or so.  <br/><br/>Negatives-<br/>The negative I can say was that there was an issue with the fire alarm- our second night into our stay was a little unsettling to say the least, as the battery in the fire alarm was not working and had kept us and the neighbours up for two nights in a row!  We felt very apprehensive about even attempting to cook anything in the kitchen because of this problem with the faulty alarm as it activated itself in the apartment when we where out for no reason. The wall where the alarm was fixed to had caved in when the handy man tended to solve the issue. This added to our stress and jet lag and where told to pay damages for the faulty alarm and damage to the wall.<br/><br/>We loved the apartment but we will not be returning because of this problem.<br/>",clean
Joshuaâs place was very clean and comfortable.  Parking was a little tricky but it all worked out.  Location was good.,clean
"Erika's apartment is very chic ,clean and comfortable, close to restaurants ,marke and all the tourists attractions.",clean
"This was a wonderful experience! I am a travel nurse so I needed a place to live for 3 months. After looking around, I saw this hidden gem. It was the perfect spot. It was recently renovated which makes it look very modern. It has a nice dining table, and I took many naps on that couch. It was quiet, which was paramount for me since I work night shift and sleep during the day. It was cozy and the bed was comfortable. Bathroom was nicely done with a large shower head (good water pressure too). There was a heated lamp so for all you folks who don't like getting out of the shower cold, this is the place for you. Full size fridge/freezer, dish washer, and washer/dryer on site of the apartment complex. There were grills that are open to residents. Grass was always green. The parking was behind a gate and the condo was behind another gate which made me feel very safe. There was a walking/biking route 0.1 miles from the AirBnB. I walked my dog there every morning. When I let him out at night, there were places right out front that I can take him to do his business without walking far at all.  Erika was fantastic as well. Very informative and always quick to respond to everything. I had no problems. It was a great home and I was sad to go. I recommend this place to anyone staying a short visit or extended stay. Great host and a great location and condo!",location
"The apartment is in a gated community which gives a sense of security, both for the apartment and car as they have a secure car park. Everyone I came across during my stay was welcoming and smiley! I would most definitely stay again and Erika is a fantastic host!",clean
Josh and Jason were very friendly when we checked in. Great location if you plan to explore in K-town.,location
"Bonnie was a very friendly and easy to get along with host. She's quite pleasant to talk to but she is also a very busy women, so you will have plenty of privacy. The home is comfortable and well-kept. Bonnie is quite responsive, so if you have any questions she will be able to answer them quickly and thoroughly. The room is pretty nice, and has a very large smart TV for entertainment. <br/><br/>The nicest thing about this listing however, is the location. The spot is less than a minute walk away from the beach. The neighborhood is super nice and safe. There are plenty of restaurants in the area as well. This listing is the epitome of prime location!",location
Cute little place reasonably close to the beach. Adequate for a weekend place to dump your stuff or rest your head. Very characteristic of Manhattan Beach as a whole.,location
"Ryan's place is unique and amazing.  Hidden in the canyon and away from the hustle and bustle yet so close to Malibu beach.  This was a terrific place to stay.  Very clean, quiet and comfy.  Check in was simple and Ryan was always available to answer our requests or questions.  I'll stay again for sure.  Beautiful views.",location
"It has a great location in the Korea town with many good restaurants around. Ralphs is close by and we could find everything we needed within a 5-min walk even though we had 2 small kids. Josh is also very quick in responding, which we appreciated.",location
"Overall, this is a very convenient and well-priced place to stay. The price tag on this Air B n B was around $250 for 2 nights, which was very affordable in L.A compared to other places (most places can go upto $300-$350). After a few days, if felt like this place became our second home because it had a fully functioning kitchen, bathroom, 2 double beds, and a sofa. The place is very roomy and accurate to the description, but it is more spacious in person. The layout is similar to a studio-style apartment. There are two beds, both comfortable, but nothing fancy. There arenât any âfrillsâ to this place, so you receive what you pay for. With that being said, everything was cleaned upon arrival and all the basics (hairdryer, straightener, soap/shampoo, etc.) were provided. <br/><br/>Some of the small touches I did appreciate were the cooking supplies and basic ingredients provided (salt, pepper, cooking oil, etc.) so you didnât have to buy those separately. Since we did make some omelettes in the morning, this saved us a good $5-7 since all we needed to purchase was the eggs/milk/etc. Another thing I will mention is that the location is really great. You are about a 7 minute walk from Ralphâs (similar to Safeway for NorCal folks). And you are near the heart of Koreatown. There are restaurants a 7-10 minute walk away from the location. The neighborhood is safe and isnât noisy at night, which can be hard to find in areas of Downtown L.A. There is an H-Mart (Korean Supermarket) about 10 minutes away and the place is about a 13 minute walk from Koreatown Plaza & Koreatown Galleria, if you want to visit The host was kind enough to provide all this information when we checked-in! <br/><br/>The host had excellent communication! Super fast responses and they made sure to answer all our questions. In addition to that, they were incredibly accommodating and allowed VERY early luggage drop-off which I canât help, but appreciate! Probably one of the top hosts Iâve met. <br/><br/>Some things I will mention is that the place does seem a bit on the older side, but has some visible refurnishings. The countertops for both the bathroom and kitchen are new, however the knobs for the faucets are quite old. While they are workable, the knobs for both the bathroom and kitchen are loose. They have a tendency to fall off, but if you are gentle with them there are no issues in usage. Some of the cups seemed to be glued back together after theyâve experienced cracks so they do have some wear and tear to them. In general, the place does seem to have a bit of wear and tear once you look at the walls and so forth. Also the sofa has some water stains on them and seems to have been in use for quite some time. Other than that, everything is just as the description. <br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this place and if you are looking for something convenient, budget-friendly, and with a great location. Secondly, the host is incredibly responsive which I always look for!",space
Joshua and Jason are very good hosts. It was a nice experience!,host
"We spent 2 weeks in Josh's place. We checked in very late but his friend Alex patiently waited for us and assisted us in checking in. The place is in great location. It is walking distance to bus stop, Mcdo and restaurants. There is also a grocery nearby where we bought all we need especially in cooking. Oh, yes! We cooked our food whenever we could cause the place is complete with cooking wares and utensils. The room was also cozy and warm even during the very cold days outside. Everything in the room works perfectly. We never encountered any problem. Most importantly, the host answered  our queries quickly and he allowed us to check out late and even met us before we left his place. We had a great stay!",location

This was a great place to stay on our way through town. We stayed for one night but Josh was absolutely great at communicating and checking in. He gave us some great tips for what was around when we got there!,location
"Josh's place is a detached guest house to the rear of the main house, separated from the rest of the driveway by a wooden fence with a door. It's quiet and clean, however the hot water did not work on the morning of our stay, and I had to shower in the cold. Other than that, it's a nice, simple place near Koreatown, good for a night or two's stay for no-frills travelers, and cheaper than a hotel.",location

"Sacha is an excellent host.  Detailed instructions for accessing the apartment were provided in advance of my arrival.  Host was available to answer all questions in a timely manner. The apartment was as pictured and very accessible to all that Santa Monica has to offer.  Shopping, green markets, beach, etc. was all in 5 min walk.    <br/>The apartment was well furnished, comfortable and had all the necessities for a home away from home.  I only wish my trip could have been longer.  I would definitely visit this location again!!! ",location
"This is my second time renting from Sacha. This apartment is located on a very relaxed residential block deeper into Santa Monica. Really good if you're in town for work... A very relaxing place to come home to. Plus it's a 3 minute walk to the beach! Great space, nice kitchen, I really good place to stay. ",location
"The guest house has exactly what you need for a quick trip to LA. We spent most of our time out and about and mostly used the space to sleep and shower, however we spent one afternoon in just watching movies which was great considering the host has an apple tv connection. The Bnb is just 10 minutes away from the Metro which can get you to most tourist attractions in the city within 30 minutes to an hour.  The guest house was super clean and even though it has a single window unit, that thing blows cold so no worries on being cool or adjusting temperatures.  No worries about bugs or critters. Definitely worth the price. Hosts were accommodating to our group and made the check in and check out process a breeze. Hopefully you get to enjoy your stay here as well.",clean
Thank you Sacha! It was great staying in this beautiful apartment.<br/>I immediatelly felt at home. Hopefully I can come back! I would - always!,location

"I visited Santa Monica for business, and Alex's place added pleasure to that. I was looking for a quiet place where I could walk to work, and where I could disconnect and feel ""at home"" in the evenings and weekends -- and I got all of this. What I, as a business traveler, appreciated the most was the smooth check-in/out process, great wifi/cable, and Alex's responsiveness (consistently within minutes). Plus an insanely comfortable bed! Everything just worked. Best part: I got used quickly to my Saturday morning walks along Santa Monica's Palisades Park, just around the corner. ",location
"This is a wonderful apartment. If you see it available, just take it.  You will not regret anything. The location is superb, just a few blocks from the beach, the promenade, the Palisades park, movie theatres, restaurants, shopping markets, coffe shops .... whatever you need, you have just a few steps from the apartment. The building is quiet as you can not imagine.  That is a must after a whole day strolling along Santa Monica.  Also, Sasha -the host- is just a few blocks away and ready to solve whatever problem you could have (we did not have any!!!!).  We highly recommend this listing and we are ready to come back.",location

As it is an older apartment building, you could hear the pipes/water of the above unit, so if you are a sensitive sleeper, something to keep in mind. Not much you can do about it if you select an apartment in Santa Monica and Alexanderâs place is truly great!",clean
"Amazing location, quiet, spacious place. Even had an easy to access parking spot, and the little outdoor area was perfect for getting some fresh air or a morning coffee. The bedroom had tons of hangers and drawers and I felt right at home. I'd highly recommend!",location
Alexanderâs place is great! I stayed there for a little over two weeks and the unit had everything I needed! It is in a great location - a few minutes to the Palisades Park/beach and there are lots of coffee places and restaurants within walking distance. The host was great with giving recommendations and very responsive with any questions I had. I was able to easily work from home from the kitchen table and the the washer/dryer for the complex were clean and I didnât have any issue with access. <br/><br/>I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a âhome away from homeâ or just a weekend stay!,clean
This is a great spot close to the heart of everything in Santa Monica. Alexander was extremely helpful and the apartment was amazing for a long stay.,location
We had a nice stay at Alexanderâs place. The apartment was comfortable and very close to shops and lots of nice cafes. Our property manger was very responsive to any queries we had.,location
Clean and bright. Responsive property manager.,clean
"Overall we had a great experience with this rental.<br/><br/>Pros: Fantastic location blocks from the water and a comfortable walk to downtown Santa Monica with lots of restaurants, shops, and a fantastic farmers market. Apartment felt clean and was equipped with all the essentials for a longer stay, including extra blankets/towels, basic kitchen supplies (pots, pans, knives, dishes) and pantry items (oil, salt, flour); we cooked a couple of meals there during our stay. Bed and pillows were comfortable. Unit has good privacy, entrance is separated from other units in the building. Fantastic communication with Robert, the person who manages the rental; we really appreciated that he checked in via text mid-stay to make sure we were okay.<br/><br/>Minor Cons: Decor is slightly different from the photos; a darker color motif instead of the bright orange color scheme. Fireplace listed as an amenity is not actually usable by guests.",clean
"This was a perfect get away. Started off rough because my transportation broke down and they came and got me. Later in the trip I locked myself out of the house! 15 min.s help arrived. The place is very quiet and comfortable. The bed was so cozy, kitchen was wonderful.  The neighborhood is walkable and close to places to eat, shop,  and the beach. The house next door has a beautiful garden and we sat out each morning and afternoon and watched all of the birds and squirrels.  It is a very quiet neighborhood, and the host was always available and helpful. Don't miss your chance to stay at this beautiful place.",location
We had a great stay here. We especially loved:<br/><br/>- Proximity to the beach and promenade<br/>- Walking distance to many restaurants and coffee shops<br/>- Spacious kitchen<br/>- Comfy mattress <br/>- Quiet neighborhood<br/>- Fast wifi <br/>- Easy communication and flexible check-in<br/><br/>Weâd be happy to come back!,location
"This was a wonderful trip. Great location! About 10min walk to the beach, about 15 min walk to the promenade. There is also local coffee shops and restaurants near by as well. The apartment was very clean and up to date.",clean
"This place is great!  The apt was spotless and had everything we needed in a kitchen, entertainment, etc.  They were extremely communicative and always on top of everything.  For example, at one point, the internet stopped working (it was our fault) but they ran over to the place right away to help us fix the situation.  I would 100% stay here again and recommend it to other folks!  Plus the location can't be beat!",clean
Great location. Close to beach and shops. The place needs to be fixed up and there were few  supplies,location
"We spent a little over a week in Alexander's place in Santa Monica.<br/><br/>What we loved: We loved the location. It was very close to the beach, shops, restaurants, and located in a walkable neighborhood. We also appreciated the personal and friendly check-in by Robert. He showed us around the apartment and made sure we had everything we needed. The wifi was great and made working from home easy.<br/><br/>What we did not like: The apartment was unclean. There was a small stain on the bed spread and a smell in the kitchen.  Also, we had numerous insects including ants and roaches. There was also some construction in other units which was loud at times, and we were not given prior notice.<br/><br/>Overall, we appreciate the hospitality and the chance to stay near the beach!",clean
"Great location, charming, and excellent service from Robert at check-in and to answer any questions.",location
Robert was an excelent host. The location was good  and very  quiet  and confortable place. We enjoyed our stay very much and we strongly recommend this apartment.,location

"Great location - easy walk to a coffee shop, the promenade, and the beach! Also, love the cute little patio!",location
"Two best things about this apartment - location and the property manager, Robert. The location is perfect if you like strolls by the Santa Monica Beach and in the elegant NoMo area. You get all the amenities of Montana Ave which is safe and offers a wide variety of well curated distractions in terms of food and shopping. It is so close to supermarkets, pharmacies, trust worthy massage establishments and nail and hair bars. Robert took such good care of us! He was so responsive and had the best efficient but engaged and personal style. The only two areas I felt could have been improved upon was the cleanliness of the bathroom and patio - but they were in good enough condition. I highly recommend staying here, but only when I am not in Santa Monica because then I'll fight you for it!",location
"Alexander apartment is perfect for a little trip to Santa Monica. <br/><br/>The location is great. Close to the beach as well as to restaurants, shops and grocery stores. <br/><br/>Alexander and Roberts are very understanding, flexible and helpful.

Awesome host :D",location
Great place to stay. We will be back whenever we are in Santa Monica. Robert is a gem. He answered all of our questions and fixed whatever needed to be done incredibly quickly. <br/>Well equipped kitchen and quiet location.,location
"This place is a gem. You can't beat the location -- 5 blocks one way is the beach and 5 blocks the other is shopping, restaurants, spas, etc. The neighborhood is pretty & quiet. Appreciate the available parking spot. I'll likely be back soon!",location
"Itâs extremely well located â so close to both the beach and all the shopping/eating on Montana. Itâs clean, comfortable, and quiet. The manager was extremely helpful at check-in. The kitchen is the most well equipped that Iâve seen in an Airbnb. The parking spot was an added plus. Definitely would stay there again!",clean

"Alexâs place is great. Itâs in a quiet, convenient location a few blocks from the beach and a few blocks from the shops and restaurants on Montana Street. We had a wonderful time.",location
"This is a lovely location and a quiet, charming apartment. I'd recommend it to anyone looking to explore Santa Monica.",location
"Let's start with location -- five blocks to  Palisades Park where a staircase takes you to the beach, five blocks to Third St promenade where you shop & dine, shorter to Montana Ave for the same. Plus an easy walk to Santa Monica Pier.  We went out a lot but loved the home comforts, too -- best bed ever, big bathroom, well-stocked kitchen, space for our computers, fast Wifi and two premium channels on big-screen TV.  Plus a personally guided tour by Robert to start us off. Needless to say we'll be back.  Howard & Diana (Maryland)",location
"My husband & I just spent a week at this lovely apartment. This was our 2nd visit here & we look forward to returning. The location is great - just several blocks to the ocean & to all the Montana shops & restaurants. The apartment is very nicely furnished, quiet & immaculate. Check in & out was easy. Thanks Robert & Alex!",location
Loved being so close to the ocean and Montana Ave! <br/>Easy location to get everywhere.,location
"After having stayed in numerous types of accommodations in the LA area, I have to say Alexâs place in Santa Monica was the best.  Convenient to Montana Ave.âs shops, restaurants, and grocery stores.  Pleasant, short walk to Palisades Park. Lots of amenities, including all the cooking implements you could need in the kitchen, and a lovely little patio to use. Private and QUIET! <br/><br/>âHome away from homeâ truly applies here!â  Of special note was the hospitality and helpfulness of Robert.  Canât go wrong with a stay here.",location

"Great location, well-equipped with everything you need for your stay, easy communication with property manager, and safe and quiet area. Will definitely stay here again!",location
"Loved the quiet neighborhood and walking distance to Montana, the beach, 3rd street, and Venice.",location
The apartment was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. The location is great and the garage parking is a huge perk! We had some issues of bugs in the bathroom which management was responsive of and said theyâd get an exterminator to come after our stay so hopefully others donât have that issue. I would stay here again.,clean
"Great location! Safe, easy parking from the alley in backâ¦ Contrary to what another reviewer indicated, on a chilly night I had a fire in the fireplace and it was great! ð I really appreciated the well stocked kitchen and the small, private patio was a real treat. Recommended!",location
Sebastian was very helpful and I gave him a 10. Place was nice and conveniently located. Exactly as advertised.,location
"The photos don't do this place justice. Beautiful condo and scenery in a great location. It's near the heart of downtown, lots of restaurants and activities to keep us busy. Sebastian was a great host and easy to communicate with. Absolutely loved our stay! ",location
Beautiful condo with the beach in your backyard. Sebastian was great with communication and definitely gave us our privacy. We stayed in his condo for 6 months and loved every minute! Would definitely book again!,location
"Sebastian's place was great, stayed there for three months, no hassles at all. The public washing machines are sometimes very busy, so you have to pick your times. Otherwise, perfect.",clean
"Hi all, Sebastian's apartment is quality however the building it is in has a few problems. Our main issue was our babies clothes were stolen from laundry room. Very little was done about this and it has left a tasteless and seedy experience which obviously had bad knock on effect to our trip. I've no idea what sort of a person takes those items. How negative u want to label them is up to u I know what I'd really like to say but sure what good will it do now. I was only encouraged to call the police on our last day there only couple of hours before our flight and two weeks after the theft took place. Not once did anyone from the building come to see us to talk about the theft. Right from the off the manager was rude and ignorant to say the least and the vibe throughout was for us to just forget about it. Sebastian offered to pay for the items and as sound as that was how do you replace a babies blanket? So to sum up I'd be very careful as a family staying here but would have little fears as singles or couples.",clean
"Sebastianâs place is in an amazing location within walking distance to Shoreline Village, shopping, restaurants, and the Aquarium of the Pacific. The patio offers a great view of the Queen Mary and marina. <br/>Sebastian was quick to respond and flexible when we had to cut our trip short. He is a wonderful host and would stay there again.",location
I stayed at Sebastianâs for three months and had a great experience. He was timely with responses throughout my stay. The space was clean and as advertised. The locations was amazing! Right on the beach. Close enough to bike to restaurants and grocery stores. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb to others! Thanks Sebastian!,clean
Sebastian is a great host. The condo is actually larger than pictured and in a great location. Parking a second vehicle is tough but the covered garage was great for my wife. Only complaint was the up stairs neighbor. Other than that it was very enjoyable.,location
Perfect host and ideal location,location
"You would be absolutely insane to not stay here. The ease of parking and the views are fantastic. This unit is a vacationers, or in my case, workers dream come true. To come home after work and walk out the back sliding doors onto the hot-tub, pool, relaxation deck overlooking the ocean is amazing. <br/>Can not recommend this enough. I will definitely be back more than once.",location
The pictures shown are accurate of where youâll be staying,location
The apartment is as described and shown in the pictures! The parking space is very important and useful - outside parking in the evening is tight. I had never problems to wash. The sun deck was great! It was always easy to communicate with Sebastian. I recommend to stay at Sebastianâs apartment !,clean
"Awesome Host! An amazing property, exactly as the pictures describe.",location
"This place was perfect for a little weekend getaway for my boyfriend and me. Very clean and cute living area tucked away in the mountains and trees, while still being within ten minutes of the ocean and beaches.",location

"My family and I had a wonderful experience at Guillermo's place. His ex-wife was very sweet and accommodating. The guesthouse is exactly as it is described. Very clean, comfortable beds and chairs and lots of space.  ",clean
"Book this place if you can! This place was perfect for our 5-day stay in LA. It is located in a fantastic location that is excellent for the post-breakfast and pre-dinner stroll around the neighborhood. It is close and accessible to all major roads and highways, so traveling by car is not an issue. Parking on the street could be troublesome for those who aren't fans of parallel parking, but you can always find a spot to park. <br/><br/>The house itself is clean and cozy. It feels like home away from home. The house comes fully stocked with everything from extra towels and bedding to a coffee maker and grill. We stocked the fridge during our stay and made use of the great kitchen. The rooms were so comfortable and the bathrooms were clean. <br/><br/>Ligia is a genuinely caring host and will do everything she can to make your stay pleasant. I appreciated her patience and sincerity during our stay. (We arrived late due to a delayed flight and we accidentally locked ourselves out once... But she still helped us out with a smile!)<br/><br/>If I am ever in the neighborhood again, I'll definitely book this place. ",location
"My mother-in-law and family stayed here for a weekend while visiting for a graduation. They were very comfortable: the layout of the space is great and really accommodates 4 people comfortably, and the location (3 minute walk to grocery stores and restaurants) also meant that we could make dinner as a family very easily without having to drive places. The price was great and parking was easy. My family had a couple of suggestions for improvement: a little bit of cleanliness issues in the bathroom, and they found themselves needing a few more blankets/bed clothes/towels. A hairdryer would be a bonus, but absolutely not necessary! All around, this beautiful little spot helped us have a relaxing family weekend together and provided a great ""home away from home."" Thank you!<br/>",clean
"Have not met Guillermo, but all was taken care of by his partner in crime: Ligia. She was very nice and showed us around in this great house. Plenty of room for the four of us. Everything was great about this place! The location is awesome and everything was clean. I would love to recommend this place to all of you when visiting Los Angeles!<br/><br/>Parking is free on the street and we had no troubles finding a spot ;-)<br/><br/>Thank you Guillermo and Ligia, we had an awesome stay!!!",clean

The appartment was as described (in fact the appartment looks in reality even better than on the photos). Everything was well organized and worked out smoothly. We stayed there for a week as a family and felt very comfortable. The neighborhood is very nice due to its proximity to Griffith park, the nice stores and houses and restaurants. All in all, we can fully recommend this guesthouse and we would definite come again if we will come back to LA one day in the future.",clean
Guillermo and Ligia were both very nice host. They were very prompt at responding to messages. They made sure the house was ready for our arrival and they made us feel at home. The house was very comfortable and the neighborhood was very safe. It was very close to the Hollywood sign and to the walk of fame. I would definitely book again with them. ,location

Great place and locality. Trader Joe's was walkable enough to go buy groceries. If you're 4 adults it might be a little crowded to sleep since the beds are small. Otherwise all the amenities were great!,location
Had an incredible time at Guillermoâs place. It is located just a short ride from anywhere youâd want to visit and genuinely felt like home when we stayed (Website hidden by Airbnb) was hard to leave at the end of the week.

Safe parking on their driveway and great communications with the owner, Ryan.",clean
Apartment is as shown in pictures. Ryan is a very good host! You must have a car and good driving skills to get into the apartment!,location
I would highly recommend staying at Ryan's place for a Malibu getaway. Super clean and very affordable.,clean
Ryan's private basement studio was a perfect location to get away from the hustle and bustle of LA but is still close enough to Malibu that you can hop down for dinner pretty quickly! The location is up in the hills and the drive can be a bit harrowing if you aren't used to driving on narrow and windy roads! I thought the views on the drive up and down though were spectacular and well worth it. The space had everything we needed to rest of heads comfortably after a couple days of exploring the area. Check in was easy and smooth. I would recommend this space without reservation!,location
If only I could rate it 6 stars...,clean

Jean's place was very nice - just like the photos.  I was not able to stay due to a recent fire in the building.  The floor the condo was on had industrial fans running all the time and although it was clean looking the smell of the smoke was too much for me.  Jean was extremely understanding and did refund my entire stay for me.  I would stay here when all the repairs are complete in the building.  Jean's manager was right on time and very nice to me throughout the whole process.  <br/><br/>I wish it would have worked out better for all of us.  The customer service was impeccable and that is a rare quality in todays world..,clean
"I hesitate to tell you how great this place was because then you all will want to stay there!  It was very nice, very close to the airport, ocean, stores, restaurants, Venice Beach, etc.  We would absolutely stay there again.

"This apartment is lovely and with great amenities.<br/>The bed is super comfortable, the space is big, the kitchen well equipped and the pool and gym are definitely a massive perk for a sporty person like me.<br/>Also, this may seem comical, but shoutout to Jean for not buying useless thin toilet paper.<br/>That's what I always find in AirBnB apartments but not here. This toilet paper was thick and awesome... #GirlsPriorities eh!?!<br/>Thank you for a great say. Will be back for sure if I return to the area.",clean

It's also a quiet and safe neighborhood, yet very close to the beach and other popular spots in LA. Jean was an amazing host as well - She's very responsive, and  quite flexible with check-in and check-out, and helped with a last minute extension of our stay. I'd definitely come back when we're in the area.",clean
"This was my first time to Los Angeles. I travelled with my brother for just over a month there coming all the way from Canada. It was truly AMAZING at Jeanâs place! I was looking at different places around Southern California for around 2 days until I spotted Jeanâs! The plentiful of perfect reviews stood out to me along with excellent communication & value and now I find myself writing my own perfect review for her! Everything was honestly fabulous. The cleanliness, home-feeling, location, amenities, communication, value etc.. you just canât go wrong here. The pool & hot-tub is seriously such a nice luxury to lounge at when you donât feel like going out. Also, Jean is an extremely kind & warm-hearted person and responds so quickly with any inquiry you have about ANYTHING. We didnât even meet in person and I felt like I knew her for years. But all in all, if I could give my stay 100 stars, I would. I will be back to Southern California in the next year and I know where I will be staying! Thank you so much Jean for a truly unforgettable getaway!",clean

You are 15 min. away from the beach and an abundance of hiking trails and everyone we came across was very friendly and welcoming.<br/><br/>The space is beautiful and clean. The bed is comfortable.

"Be respectful and kind. This is Joshuaâs one rule. True to form, Joshua was a kind host who welcomed us into our Airbnb. This was my first time using Airbnb- hosts like this is why Iâll come to the app.",host
Cute studio. Walking distance to many restaurants and grocery store.,location
"A rare gem on AirBnB. City close, but in a natural setting. This place was spotlessly clean, everything was new and stylish and comfortable. It was easy to check ourselves in. We really enjoyed waking up and having the coffee station right there! Then, there were breakfast and markets close by to fuel up and pack up lunch and we went on a great hike in Topanga State Park. Later, it was closer than you would think to zip down to Malibu for dinner and Venice for drinks out. Really couldn't have asked for anything more, we would definitely stay here again. Communication was really good too.",clean
Very comfortable cozy place. Great for a weekend stay in the mountain area for some hiking and chilling. We enjoyed it a lot. Hike to Eagle Rock was very pretty!,location
"Its a very nice apartment, located not far from the Ocean in a Mountain setting.<br/>A unique experience that makes for a great vacation. ",location
It was great! I enjoyed my time. Its in a convenient location and is a cozy place. Would stay again!  ,location
"Melissa's place was perfect for me. Loved the location, her place was very clean, and she was a gracious host that was readily available via text whenever I needed anything. A definite favorite of mine from now on when I'm in the LA area. ",clean
The best airbnb experience I have yet encountered. A very nice place in a good area. Would stay again! ,location
"Absolutely perfect. Her home was filled with all the little things one would need as a guest and more. Great decoration, Satellite with DVR, super comfy bed, Ice Cold AC, we'll never stay in a hotel again. You can't beat the full kitchen and fully furnished goodness.  Host was very attentive, friendly and well prepared. Thank you thank you thank you!",clean
Melissa was a wonderful host! She helped me with any little thing I needed. She was always just a text away from a solution and she made me feel very safe in her beautiful apartment. The neighborhood was great and the places I needed to get to were a short walk away. Everything was very clean inside the apartment and the internet and TV worked great! I would definitely stay there again! Melissa was an absolutely wonderful host.,clean
Melissa is very welcoming and extremely helpful. She was prompt in responding to my query and provided all information needed immediately.,clean
The place is in a very good spot. Close to everything and very warmfull,location
The host canceled this reservation 99 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.,clean
"The apt is as described. It is a good value for what we paid for! A nice touch was our own personal parking spot, so we didn't have to look for parking at all every night we came back home. <br/><br/>A few things worth mentioning though: <br/>- the apt had AC, and even the bedroom had its own AC unit...but the AC did not work in the bathroom. <br/>-the AC unit in the bedroom is loud! My gf did not sleep well the first night<br/>-Host charged a cleaning fee, but I had instructions to take our trash on the last day<br/>-Check in time is (Website hidden by Airbnb) is listed as ""flexible,"" and host was notified not once but twice about my specific arrival time. She notified me that I had arrived too early when I had arrived at my mentioned arrival time, so I had to pay for an extra night. In the end, I paid her but I suggest the host lists a check in time to not further confuse future airbnbers. <br/><br/>",price
The space is great - perfect for 2 people. The area is quiet and beautiful. The beach is a short drive as well as gorgeous hiking options. Ryan was also quick to respond and very attentive to make sure we had everything we needed. Very pleased with our stay!,location
We enjoyed our stay at Ryanâs. Thank you for accommodating for us and making our trip easy. Definitely recommend his place!,clean
"Ryan is very welcoming and his suggestions are spot on! Property is secluded in very friendly neighborhood. The patio is perfect for enjoying the beautiful mountain mornings with a hot cup. Soooo close but so far away, perfect!",location
"Ryanâs place was amazing! Great views, perfect studio and a super responsive host. Would definitely come back again!",location
"Ryanâs place is a very nice apartment hidden in the hills near Santa Monica. It is tucked away in the mountains (about 30 mins from Santa Monica. The drive up and down is very steep, so be very careful. Lyft does go up to the apartment though! <br/><br/>The apartment is complete with a beautiful bathroom and kitchen. There is a small induction stove top, good for cooking small meals, and a microwave. There are a variety of utensils perfect for putting a meal together. <br/><br/>Everything else about the place is perfect!! Itâs wonderful to be secluded but yet so close to everything. Thank you for everything. Ryan!",location
"I stayed at Ryanâs place for a long weekend getaway and it was perfect. Beautiful area and had so many outdoor activities to do nearby (hiking, beach, etc). Ryan was very prompt in responding to my questions and everything I needed was in the space. Iâll definitely stay here again next time Iâm in the area",location
"This location might be a little hard to find, but that's a plus if you are looking for something different from metro-L.A.  Once you find the driveway, parking is easy -straight in and half under roof cover.  The room is light on storage but spacious.  Ryan is a great host (accessible, responsive, flexible).  We spent time with family in L.A., but if all you do is meet Ryan, hike Trippet Ranch, visit with the locals, explore Topanga (history, shops, homes and dining), you won't miss L.A.",location
My now fiancÃ© and I got engaged the first night visiting. Ryan had no idea but made our stay pleasant and easy stayed in communication about the best way to get to the place and even turned on the space heater for us since it was chilly out and he knew we were on our way. I was familiar with Topanga and love the area but it is a very curvy road up in the mountains; if you can get past the dizzying curves itâs a beautiful area not too far from PCH or if you head over the mountain the other way 101 making it easy to navigate around LA.,location
Ryan is a great host and the suite is absolutely wonderful. We had everything what we needed for a stay. I would come back any time.,clean
"This place is a gem. Seriously. A perfectly situated spot close to the PCH but tucked away in the serene Topanga Canyon. Ryan is a great host and his place shows it. Key details: great recommendations for eats and shopping, good selection of appliances for cooking/coffee, relaxing environment w/ outdoor seating, comfortable bedding, exceptionally clean, convenient parking. Can't go wrong here.",clean
"Ryan's place worked out perfectly and had all the essentials.  This caffeine junkie was particularly thankful for the coffee!  This location is perfect to get to everything around LA, yet feels very rural.  Had a blast hiking in the area and exploring the City and beaches alike!",location
"I've always wanted to live in Topanga, and after moving away from LA last summer, it was a wonderful experience travelling back to spend a few nights there. The location is beautiful, close to surfing, rock climbing, and hiking, and not that far from Santa Monica, LA, and the valley. If you love the mountains and mid century decor, this is the place for you. Ryan was a great host, even though we didn't meet him, and was kind enough to leave the door unlocked so we could check in around midnight after our flight got in.<br/><br/>The only thing that kept me from complete five stars is that the ceiling is a little thin, and by 8am you can hear life starting to happen upstairs, making it a little hard to sleep in. Nothing abnormal for staying in someone's house, but just something to note if you are expecting a total enclave of silence, or if you're a light sleeper and plan to sleep in.",location
Very peaceful and clean! Bed are comfortable and bathtub was a plus! Bit smaller Than expected but pretty worth it! ðð¼ðð¼,clean
Ryan was an awesome host. His home was in a great location up in the mountains! He was very friendly throughout the whole stay. Will definitely come back. Thanks!!,location
"We loved our stay! We were surprised to not have phone service when we arrived but the WiFi helped with that. The roads are narrow and windy but once you know where youâre going itâs fine, just try to arrive in the daylight, especially your first time. We loved hearing the laughing kiddos playing outside!",location
"Very clean and modern, Ryan is an awesome host! Topanga is a hidden gem in the greater LA area, and Ryan makes sure to let you know of the best spots and restaurants!",clean
Everything was as described. Direction accessing the apartment was very clear and we had no issue. Great location for visiting LA.,location
"The worst thing you can say about this place is that it's near the airport. Everything else you could possibly care about is A+. Except maybe the A/C and parking which each get a B-. The pictures don't do the apt any justice, it's a really cute little place and there's even a park within walking distance. The space feels very much like it's intended for entertaining guests so it's very welcoming. Would definitely stay again.",location
"Melissa's place made me feel right at home. No issues checking in, Melissa was swift at responding, the bed was comfy and in a convenient location.  Could have been a tad more tidy, but I would absolutely recommend for anyone visiting LA. I will defintely stay again. It was VERY much like I was home away from home. YOU WILL GET ATTACHED! Thanks Melissa.",clean
Loved the place. Check-in directions were straightforward. Place was nicely furnished. Host was very flexible with check-in/check-out times and very helpful. A+,clean
"If you're traveling into Burbank on a budget, this place is a MUST BOOK! Melissa is incredibly friendly and gracious, providing a charming decorated space fully stocked with food and beverages (all of which she generously offers to her guests!) that is within walking distance from the airport. I highly recommend reserving with Melissa for a truly unforgettable experience that won't break the bank. ",location
"Stayed for 8 days to attend a week long event at the Burbank Marriott. The rate alone makes this apartment worth the stay! The Marriott rates were 200+/night and it was less than 5 minutes to walk there!   Check in was super convenient and Melissa responds to texts if you need anything! Perfect place to stay for my son and I as we didn't need all of the extra amenities of the hotel. Comfortable bed, cold a/c (prepare for normal window unit noise), wifi, Xbox, wii, board games and more.  There is a neighbor that likes loud music but only during daytime hours so no problem there for us. Will book again if we travel back to the area!",location
Loved staying at Melissa's! It was a very home-like apartment that made me feel very comfortable and happy! She is very great at communicating and very courteous to her tenants!,clean
This location is literally next to the Marriott  Hotel. I did not need to pay for transportation. Marriott is also walking distance from the Bob Hope Airport in Burbank.  The best thing I enjoyed about Melissa place is that she had Wi Fi and Netflix.,location
Great little place that is close to Universal Studios. Definitely would stay here again,location
Fantastic location if you're attending a conference at the Marriott and much better value. The apartment is cozy and felt like a home away from home. Check-in and out were a breeze as well.,location
If you're looking for a homey feel and a nice place to stay durinf your trip i would suggest Melissa's place. It was great and i was literally only a few minutes away from everything. I had a blast!,location
Melissaâs place is exactly what we needed for our stay in Burbank. We were in walking distance to the Marriott Convention Center where we had events every day throughout the week. Her place was so cozy and very inviting. Michelle herself was available for anything we needed. Highly recommend this space.,location
Melissa was one of the most flexible and easy to communicate hosts Iâve experienced yet. Her place is in a great location with universal studios and tons of restaurants all within a 10 minute drive.,location
"We recommend the Santos place! <br/>This family was the nicest hosts ever. They provided us with info of the location and even took our two big boys out for a drive to show them downtown LA. <br/>Carmen provided us with water every day and cooked an amazing breakfast for us every single morning. She even cleaned the house every day when we were out to train or experience Cali. <br/>This house is very family friendly and the area is safe with lots of kids around. We easily took a morning or evening run around the block feeling really safe. <br/>We will definitely stay at this house again, this host is amazing. <br/>",location
"Very friendly family, very accommodating. Made us breakfast every day. Tried hard to resolve any problems.  In a busy working class neighborhood with houses close together,  so some noise with open window couldn't be helped. Generous with food and a large space. Convenient location. No air conditioning if that is important,  but the fans worked well",location
"We had to book this at the last minute, when a different host cancelled our reservation on the same day.  Ralph and his family were great!  My family of five checked in very late after a day at Disneyland.  There was plenty of space for our family.  There were two full/queen size beds, and a queen size air mattress.  Ralph's mother Carmen cooked breakfast for us every morning.  It was a quick drive to downtown and the convention center.<br/><br/>The wifi worked great.  Ralph installed a new Roku system for us so that the kids could watch tv.  The fridge and pantry were fully stocked, and they refilled it throughout our stay.  The last night, Carmen brought over some shrimp scampi and fried fish, along with fresh vegetables for me to add to the stir fry I was making.  <br/><br/>They replied quickly to the couple of questions we had, and made our stay very comfortable.  Carmen cleaned the house every day while we were out.  The kitchen was well stocked, and we were even able to make use of the Vitamix to make some green smoothies in the mornings.<br/><br/>The neighborhood was quiet.  We went for a couple of walks while we were there, and we felt perfectly at ease.  Parking on the street was tight, but luckily there is a private driveway at this rental that we were able to use for the duration of our stay.  The family lives in the back of the house, but the front is a self contained 2 bedroom 1 bath with a full kitchen.  They gave us our privacy.<br/><br/>Overall, I would definitely recommend this rental to anyone wanting a quiet stay near downtown.  If we make it back out to Long Beach, I'd love to stay here again.",location
"We had a great weekend stay at Ralph's. Everything was neat and clean, and the neighborhood was very quiet. Carmen even made a delicious breakfast every morning!",clean
The place was super clean and it had everything as mentioned. I wouldn't think twice to go again! ,clean
Loved our stay. Ralph was super accommodating and his mother cooked us delicious breakfast every morning. We were also able to park in the driveway which was super helpful. Definitely will stay again! Thanks Ralph :),clean

Good value for the location. ,location
"This is a quaint older home in a quiet, clean neighborhood.  We were able to park in their driveway which made things simpler since we drive a full size SUV.  Cher and her family live in an attached residence and were wonderful to us. They brought out a huge blowup mattress for our teen daughter and had the house ""toddler friendly"" knowing we were bringing a 1 year old and 4 year old.   The only down side to having our 1 year old was the cleaning supplies in the lower cabinets and the wall radiators get hot enough to burn a babies hands. Had we not had a 1 year old with us the stay would have been perfect.   Snacks were brought out for us and our kids.   There was fresh fruit, breads, lots to drink,  a stocked bathroom, tons of extra linen and more.   Our last morning we were cooked a huge Filipino breakfast of rice,  chicken and sausages that was really yummy!    ",location
"The room was clean and stylish, and the location was beautiful. Ryan and his family were very nice every time we ran into them, I would stay again.",clean
"Ryanâs place is just what you want about an AirBNB ... easy and quick check-in, thoughtful space (my wife especially mentioned [twice] the welcomed makeup removal wipes that were in the bathroom), very tidy and clean, comfortable bed, a spot to park. Itâs obviously outside of the bustle of the city, which we loved during our short two-day trip. The drive up and down is beautiful and winding. Ryan was quick with responses and even accommodated an early check-in for us. Would recommend this spot to anyone who wants a secluded home base during a trip to L.A., especially for couples who like to be active.",clean
By far one of my husband and Iâs favorite Air b n b we have ever stayed at!! The rolling hills has the best views driving up + the place was sparkling when we arrived and smelt so good + it had everything g we needed to cook/go to the beach! We are so thankful for all the little touches (especially the dove body wash haha) !! We really would love to come stay again!! HIGHLY recommend staying! Itâs a steal!! ,location
Great spot in a quiet neighborhood. Clean space with everything you need and more!,location
My guy and I had an absolute BLAST while we stayed here. Out and about at the amusement parks during the day and relaxing and sleeping like babies at night. Fans were provided which is perfect because we donât sleep well without one. The digs were just absolutely beautiful. Thank you so much! It was lovely. We will return.,location
Beautiful suite near Malibu. Thank you Ryan for allowing us to stay! The room was perfect for a weekend away on the coast. ,location

Whether you're new to AirBnB or a regular like me you can rest assured that you are getting a great deal with Joshua. The price is on point the location and amenities are above standards and the environment is relaxing and welcoming. Compared to the other available lodging in the area you would have to be insane to pick anything but his spot. The hotels and motels are getting more and more lackluster with what they offer at twice the price.  Meanwhile Joshua is on it when it comes to accommodation. Hosts like Joshua are why apps like AirBnB have revolutionized the way people choose their rooms nowadays. Do yourself a favor and book with Joshua. Thank you again.,location
"Thank you for your hospitality, my stay was great.",clean
"Ryanâs place is great, the location was perfect for us to use a base to explore Malibu and Santa Monica. It was clean and stylish. I would thoroughly recommend staying at Ryanâs",clean
"This place is as close to a hotel-like AirBNB experience you can get. Ryanâs attention to detail in setting up and preparing the room is top level. <br/><br/>Located in a very scenic environment in Topanga it offers a quiet and relaxing getaway, although not being too far from LA. We enjoyed being close to the beach, and close to Malibu. <br/><br/>The room was perfectly clean and had everything we could ask for and more. We would love to come revisit in the future!",clean
"Wow! What an amazing place to stay. It is about 12 minutes from a relativly quite beach. The trip up and down to the place is fun and winding, but so beautiful. Around every corner you will feel the need to stop to take pictures.  I appreciate the strong wifi signal (since we didnât get any cellular service), and the extra things that were not expected (like the beach towels, the cooler for the beach, extra toiletries and the supplied dishes in the kitchenette).  Ryan was very helpful with suggestions on what to do around town, making sure that we were supplied with everything we would need, very cortious to our privacy and very hospitable. Amazing host, Amazing location, and amazing getaway from everyday stresses!",location
"We loved Ryanâs place. The location was beautiful. Tucked away in the mountains, but still a short drive to Malibu. The road to the house was a narrow winding road going up a mountain, beautiful but a little scary :) The apartment was very clean and had all the supplies + more. I loved that there were make-up removal pads, body lotion, beach towels, etc. Keurig machine with Peetâs coffee was great. I couldnât ask for a better place for such a low cost. I will recommend the place to any friends travelling to LA!",clean
"Ryansâ place is awesome! I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a modern, clean and quiet place. Itâs up in the hills of Topanga and from there you can easily take a trip to LA, the valley or the beautiful California coast (Malibu for example). Ryan is super nice and responded very fast. I hope to stay there again one day!",clean
"Just what we needed for our trip to the International Salon and Spa Expo at the convention center. It was conveniently located and the hosts are very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed their Pilipino breakfast and the extra refreshments they have in the fridge to help us enjoy our stay.

"Great breakfast, and the hosts are a cute family that are certainly nice and try very hard to be accommodating. But donât expect a super clean home or much entertainment on the TVs. If you bring a Chromecast, the WiFi is too slow for easy, smooth watching. Some noise from neighborsâ dogs may wake you up in the morning, so if you like to sleep in and often have spidy senses, this may be a problem for you. If you like a lot of privacy, youâll also need to be upfront about it. One of us slept in the living room space, and though we were assured of complete privacy during our stay, the hostâs father walked in the living room one morning, which startled the one guest and disturbed his stay. After mentioning this to the host though, they made every effort not to repeat this occurrence. All in all, it was just an okay stay. We can say a lot about the house and its amenities, but we canât really say anything bad about the hosts.",location
"This was the cutest place. It has all the amenities. It was close to the Queen Mary with a quick uber. The house is clean and quiet. Breakfast is offered and although we didnât take advantage, they still provided us with coffee and eggs. <br/><br/>Itâs the perfect place to chill after a long day at a festival. Thanks for the hospitality!",clean

"Very nice people. Appreciate the kindness and hospitality.<br/>We left our travels until very last minute so had two choices. We picked this one instead of not traveling. <br/>Definitely not in a great area or fancy, but itâs was ok for last min. <br/>Price should be lowered a little in my opinion.",location
"Ralph was very kind and hospitable! The AirBnB was exactly as advertised, very clean and comfy.",clean
"Unfortunately, it wasn't a good experience. The home didn't fulfill my standard of cleaning and readiness. Kitchen and bathroom had a strong smell, one for food and the other for excessive Clorox. Also, the main bed didn't have the fitted sheet, so one sheet was missing. On the other hand, the smaller bed in the other bedroom didn't have either the fitted or the flat sheet. It had only the mattress protector and a blanket. That was unacceptable for me and my friends. Location was excellent and Carmen was a  friendly and sweet old lady that made us feel at home.",clean

Ralphâs place is greatâ accurate as listed. Very kind and welcoming family. Definitely would stay again!,location
"This place is, no joke, awesome. The location is superb and Ryan has the apartment and outdoor space setup perfectly. I sat on the outside patio every night before heading off to bed and it was soporific, rejuvenating, an almost spiritual experience (even for an atheist like me). Itâs a pretty far way up in the mountains outside of L.A., so might be best to arrive in the day the first time youâre up there. For some reason everyone in Topanga tailgates horribly, even if youâre driving well above the speed limit. I like to go slower when they do thatâmaybe slam on the brakes a few timesâto teach them a lesson in etiquette. This is not in any way a criticism of Ryanâs place, which is, as Iâve stated, da bomb. ",location
"No-frills, functional space in a convenient location with off street parking. If youâre looking for a reliable spot in LA for good value, book it!",location
"Ryan was extremely helpful and his place is BEAUTIFUL! The location is absolutely perfect nestled in the mountains, but a 10 minutes drive (really....a 10 minute drive in SoCal!!!) to the beach, Malibu and cozy restaurants. The check-in process was seamless which was super appreciated after a long trip. The place itself was beautiful with an awesome porch where we ate most of our meals. Weâd make an egg breakfast each day, pack some lunches using the apartmentâs kitchen, and head out for the day. Parking was easy, the WiFi worked very well, and it was spacious for two people. Ryan had a great list of local restaurants to check out, and we went to many of them! Canât wait to go back!!!!",location

It was very quiet and perfect to relax after a long day. Ryan is so friendly, he also gave us his surfboard for the beach. We would come back definitely and recommend Ryanâs apartment!! Thank you again :)",clean
Great area and a clean and lovey house. Ryan is very friendly and we had a great stay. We would definitely come back.,clean
"We had a great time - the suite was cozy, clean, it had a well-equipped kitchen and we were sad when our stay was over. Itâs a great location to explore Topanga, L.A. and Malibu :)",clean
Nice place . Good for couple.little bit hot,location
Nice little place if your passing through the areafor a couple of days. Very clean and comfortable,clean
"I stayed here 7 months, leaving when I left Los Angeles. A good room, in a good location, with a great host. Joshua was very helpful and friendly, as a host and as a person (including some mild nursing when I was resting in the patio with a twisted ankle.) Location is on the west edge of Koreatown, pretty quiet (especially at night) while being 5-10 minutes to Ralphs, Hmarts, restaurants, and the subway station.  The front patio of the main house (not in the photos) is very nice, Josh cultivates a lot of plants making for a green and enclosed area.  <br/><br/>--Potential gotchas: the fridge is a large dorm fridge without a freezer unit; Josh says the electrical wiring is a limiting factor. The A/C works but is underpowered for the space, it won't make the room chilly on a hot day, though the cool nights of LA kept things reasonable. Kitchen is decently equipped, but if something is missing try asking Josh for it, he'll probably provide; he even brought me a toaster oven and an electric kettle. The bathroom is a good size but the bathtub is short for someone tall.<br/><br/>--Otherwise, yeah, I chose to stay 7 months. Good if you want your own little detached 'house', no walls or ceiling shared with anyone.",location
"Josh's space was great! It's a perfect location for people traveling through LA. If you're planning on staying in Koreatown, check it out. Very responsive, super open.",location
Ralph is super responsive!  And resolved issues immediately.  We appreciate him and his family for doing whatever they could to make this a good experience.  They even installed an AC unit in the main room and one of the bedrooms which made a big difference for us!,clean
Had a great stay at Ralph's place. His place was spacious and had everything we needed. Ralph's mom prepared delicious breakfast for us too! <br/>The only con for me was it was a bit awkward when he walked through the house a few times while we were still in the house.,clean
"Great stay for a quick trip, breakfast was phenomenal!",clean
"Had an amazing stay for it to be my first time booking! The family is super sweet and open to whatever you may need, made me feel right at home! I wanted to have a get together with some friends for my birthday and they were okay with it. Honesty is always best and it helps to be on the same page! The home and beds are super comfy and even though the family is right in the back, they will not disturb you unless you request otherwise! But overall, great stay ! Would definitely do it again!",location
I would highly recommend Ralph's place. He was very accommodating and really good at responding back very quickly,clean
"What an amazing airbnb! So cozy and comfortable! Tons of ways to make coffee and tea..full kitchen! two super cozy beds and comfy living room! Close to downtown LB, short drive, plenty of parking and amazing hosts!!!! So sweet and hospitable..will do it again in a heartbeat!!",location
"Very nice and friendly service. Overall great place to be, quiet and cozy. Gave great food and coffee. Beds were very comfortable and relaxing. Whatever I needed they had with no questions asked.",location
"The place is very homey.  There was basically anything you needed in the kitchen and they even had some groceries for us in the fridge. Check in and out was very easy. I really enjoyed spending a wedding weekend here, even with all the craziness of people coming in and out and wedding prep.",clean
"I produced a dramatic short here Fri-Sunday, and it was amazing! It was very quiet during the day. Ralph offered quick and efficient resolutions whenever we had issues or questions. There was ample parking for 4+ cars (on the street), and Ralph and his mother were SOOO accommodating. They even cleaned up for us the first night! (Of course, we left a tip for their efforts and consideration). Loved this place. Will shoot here again.",location
Cute and cozy home. A bit out of style but overall the same as in the pictures.,clean
Great overall location. Comfortable beds. Easy check in & check out & very warming hospitality. Would definitely stay again if Iâm back in the area,location
"Ralph was an amazing host! He not only provided me and my friends with a clean, cozy place to spend a few days but also with two delicious home-cooked breakfasts (his mom is the best chef! Highly recommend the Filipino-style breakfast if that is new for you) and a coffee/tea set-up, easy access to the airbnb, a ride to the laundromat and some nice chats. Thank you for making our stay in Long Beach so lovely Ralph!",clean
Cool spot in a quiet neighborhood. House was nice. Definitely would go again.,location
Great place to stay! Very hospital and highly recommend if you need a place to stay in the area.,location
"This place has a very homey feel. Expect something like if you're staying with a friend. There is a kitchen door that is attached to your side of the house. Parking on the street is difficult as there's usually not many spaces. If you use the driveway, expect to shuffle around a bit in the morning since it is a single lane driveway. The host has two cars and they can fit one more. There is one remote for both bedrooms. Once turned on, don't use it again as it will turn on and off both room lights/fans. There are switches to separately turn on and off your lights/fans. There is a local AC unit in one room.",location
"The bathroom was really gross and not cleaned before we came, wifi was not strong, we had to share a light switch for both rooms. It didnât work very well and was difficult to turn on/ turn off lights in both rooms. Both rooms had ruko but, we had to share one remote.",clean
Josh and Jason are fantastic hosts! They go above and beyond what would be expected! Totally recommend!,host
"Stayed for 2 months at Joshua's and he is the king of hosting! He has an on-site property manager named John and between the two of them you are in the best and most attentive hands! They are very accommodating, even providing a free washer and dryer on-site!",host
"We stayed here for one month and had access to everything weÂ needed. The location is very central. Parking is available (which is very difficult to get in LA)Â  but can be tricky at times â since we all parked driveway, one in front of the other. Josh & Jason were very helpful about the parking situation. <br/>The small kitchen offers all the basics for light cooking and snacks â keep in mind the fridge is small (hotel kind), and it doesn't include a freezer â but there are tons of great restaurants around. The hosts are very attentive and always available to help. I'd stay here again :)",location
Joshua and Jason are great people we spent two months and it was certainly one of the best summers we have had in our lives.  thanks again guys ;)),location
"This house is GOOOOORGEOUS.  Honestly, it's like a simplistic, zen tree house that's somehow also 5 minutes from the Venice Boardwalk.  Our beds were comfy and we loved all of the living spaces.  Lauren was super quick in responding to texts and was helpful, kind, and super accommodating whenever we needed help with something.  This is an amazing rental!",location
"Our stay here went well.  Good for price.  I typically only rent places that are not a shared environment, which this is. Made parking a bit of a hassel with moving cars.  There is no A/C in one of the bedrooms, but we were able to open the window at night.",clean
"It was a charming, antique home, and had everything we needed.",location
This place was good and affordable. It was decently clean and response time was quick. I would stay again.,clean
"You can expect an entire home with no privacy. Ralphâs mother has a room/house in the back of the property with her own her and entrance to the home whenever she pleases. There was no way to lock the entrance where Ralphâs mom would enter, which made my family feel unsafe and like we had no privacy. <br/><br/>Ralphâs home is falsely advertised and if you chose to stay their just know it is like staying at someoneâs home with them in the back room. <br/><br/>This is not a home you want to rent if you want to have an entire house while on vacation or business trip. This home is more of a super host home stay with the property managers mother living in a connected part of the home.",clean
Great place in a great location.  So much to do around and everything is so picturesque.  Ryan is a great host with great communication.  Would definitely go back again.,location
"Amazing house, amazing location!<br/><br/>Spent a week in LA for business and Lauren was a great host. The house was in the perfect spot super close to Abbot Kinney Blvd and Venice beach so could walk to all restaurants and bars in the area will definitely be coming back!",location
"The place is wonderful, even better as described :-)<br/>Lauren was extremely responsive and helpful.",clean
Such a beautiful and peaceful place to stay and  still close enough to the city.,location
"you get a nice little efficiency in a beautiful part of the canyon, with all the essentials, but not a lot of extras and comfort.  Be careful when you unload your luggage from the car.  If it's on wheels and you turn your back for a minute, it's likely to roll away.  We had to chase ours, and had a great laugh about it.  Ryan is an awesome host, very responsive and welcoming.",location
"Ralph's place is quiet, clean, and comfortable! The breakfast served by Ralph's mum was the icing on the cake. Would love to stay here again.",clean
"Good stay, good neighborhood. Ralph is very quick to respond to questions.",location
We needed this stay for an event at the convention center. Its proximity equated to a simple 5$ ride share. Can't beat that! Great stay. Thanks Ralph,location
"Perfect house for our family. Spacious, comfortable, and very clean. Lauren was very responsive and accommodating. Definitely would stay there again. ",clean
"We had a great stay in Lauren's home.  The home was bright and beautiful just as the description mentioned.  The rooms were nice size, beds were comfortable and the location was great.  We had easy access to the beach, boardwalk, restaurants and all that Venice has to offer.  The two car garage was great making parking so easy.  We would give this home a two thumbs up rating!",location
My host made sure everything was in order. ,clean
"Beautiful house steps away from the beach, and nice rooftop with a view, everything went smooth with Lauren although we left in a rush and she was very helpful.",location
Great days in this nice house in Venice Beach. <br/>Lauren was so helpful and the house had everything you will need. <br/>I recommend it absolutely ,location
"Great location, fantastic house! Exactly as featured. Lauren is a great host - very friendly and always just a call away if you need anything/ have any questions. Highly recommend this place!",location
"Our host made us feel very welcome. From the first communication to our goodbye. She made it clear that she was very accessible, but I also loved the fact that she didn't reach out, unless asked a question. The house was extremely well kept and was actually even nicer than the photos on the site. It was super well located, near the best restaurants and bars in the area and minutes away from the beach itself. The neighborhood felt very safe and with 2 young children that was a big relief. I would definitely visit again!!",clean
"Amazing 4 floors house, close to beach.  Private parking included (use it! We left our van in the street and someone tried to steal it ). Very nice views from the rooftop.",location
Beautiful house Great Location just not great with communication   It was not clear to me that two of the bedrooms did not have doors- but screens were provided.  Nice bonus to have the garage for parking. ,location
"We had a wonderful visit at this lovely Venice home. There were 9 of us total (two families of 4 and my mother-in-law) and there was plenty of room for all of us. The place was clean, bright, comfortable, and extremely well located. We didn't interact with the hosts much (which is a good thing since we didn't have any problems) but Lauren was very friendly and helpful before our trip. I highly recommend this property and will hopefully be back again sometime. ",clean
"Lauren was very helpful, and answered what questions we had quickly. The house itself was great. There were four of us on a work trip, so we each needed our own space and our own bathroom, and the house certainly provided that. The location was fantastic.",location
"Lauren and her husband were great hosts, guiding us in long befor we even left for L.A. The house is magnificent, especially the roof top deck, and multiple little nooks and alcoves to escape and read a book. We were 6 people in total and the rooms worked out very well. everyone had their own space and it just flowed extremely well. We ate in most everynight in the great kitchen and dining area. Its a very short walk in any direction to great discoverables, beach, shopping, Cafe's and canals. We would return here in a HEARTBEAT. ps the garage was worth its weight in gold. ",location
"Lauren was a great host. Her home is as described: clean, spacious, nicely decorated, and about three minutes walking to Abbot Kinney. She was also quick to reply when we had questions. Highly recommended.",clean
"A nice place for the price, but needs some updates and cleaning to really shine. Once we checked in, Ralph was very responsive and attentive.",clean
"Best airbnb i have ever been!<br/>Everything was just perfect, Ralph and his Family were amazing ,easy to talk to and very friendly as well they made sure everything is ready and comfortable for us, the neighborhood is very calm and very close to the convention center (8 minutes away), the house had all what we needed quiet, clean, spacious, Big plus was the kitchen for us there it was equipped with all. <br/>Well recommended!!<br/> I would definitely come again",location
Great experience. Very comfortable home feel. Close to the highway if you need to get around,location
"Considering we came when everyone in the country started losing their minds over the Covid-19 pandemic, we made the best of it as much as we could. <br/><br/>The host(s) were very responsive and we appreciated that more than anything. The vintage smell took some adjustments, but opened windows and air fresheners helped a lot.  The home does need some major upgrades although WiFi and television were good. Parking was a little more of a hassle than anticipated but I am very adaptable. Although we cut our stay short due to the pandemic, our overall stay was suffice. ð",location
"Nice and convenient location, easy parking in front or near by. (keep your eye on the street parkings signs) friendly host",location
"Great place in the hills close to Malibu and many hiking trails. Itâs very nice and clean and communication with Ryan was perfect. We really enjoyed our stay, thanks Ryan!",clean
The place was small and cozy. Very clean and organized. The bed was very comfortable. The shower's water pressure did feel a bit weak at times. Other than that there were no problems. It was a bit scary driving through the mountains at night. Just gotta be extra careful.,clean
Love this place. Nice getaway from the city but yet close enough to many activities! definitely recommend!,location
Great little place in Topanga Canyon with a friendly host!,location
Our stay was perfect! The place was clean and comfortable.,clean
"Ryan went above and beyond the call of duty, going to a level o have never seen a host go to. He is a great guy and really cares about his guests. <br/><br/>The place is close to some of the most amazing drives in southern California and some great hiking spots.<br/><br/>if your looking for a spot to unwind and relax, and enjoy the outdoors I suggest here!",location
A very comfortable stay,clean
"My girlfriend and I wanted a little getaway from home for a couple days so we rented Ryanâs space out for two nights and it did not disappoint! It was a nice and cozy space for the two of us and we highly recommend it. If we ever need a quick getaway, we will definitely keep Ryanâs place in mind again.",location
"Ryanâs place was absolutely wonderful. Like a hotel, but better! Especially for the price. The space is decorated nicely, super trendy, & literally has everything you might need for your stay. Even if it doesnât, Ryan is very accommodating & always responds quickly! The bed is very comfortable & the black-out shades are perfect for sleeping in. Great location, stunning views, & reasonable proximity to popular areas! Definitely recommend staying here & would come back in the future!",location
"Clean, private and quiet place. Ryan is friendly and communicative. Highly recommended!",location
"Ryanâs place is wonderful. I would consider it a perfect spot to stay if you want a place away from the city and near a lot nature and beaches. Topanga is gorgeous. The mountains are breathtaking. It can be nerve-racking to drive up and down, especially at night if youâre not used to driving in mountains. But with cautious driving youâll be fine. We stayed there for the majority of our honeymoon and it was a perfect space for 2 people. It was so wonderful we wished we had just stayed the entire time there. Ryan is super responsive and helpful. The little shops nearby are fantastic as well. Malibu is just 25 mins away. He provides you a list of restaurant recommendations. We would definitely stay again.",location
"We loved our stay in this house by Venice Beach and would for sure stay here again. It was the perfect location - equidistant from the beach and from Abbot Kinney. It was a fantastic size, super comfortable for our party of five with space to spare. Lauren was great to work with, right down to a very helpful binder of best local activities and restaurants. Our party included a three year old boy, who just loved his ""vacation house."" I would say, if you have a very rambunctious toddler or preschooler, there are some antiques and glass and stone furniture with sharp corners and a lot of stairs. It was not a problem for us at all, but with some kids could pose a challenge. ",location
"We had a great time in this beautiful home.  It was a perfect location! Located between Abbot Kinney and the beach it made for an easy walk wherever we wanted to go.  There are so many places (restaurants, shops, etc.) on Abbot Kinney and to have them within easy walking distance was great.  It was so nice to have a bathroom with each bedroom.  It made the home feel huge.  The roof top deck was a great surprise.  It was great any time of the day.  We can't think of anything that would have made the house better!  We highly recommend it for groups.",location
"The house is gorgeous, just like in the pictures if not better. Incredible location. Lauren made sure we had everything we needed. Honeslty fell in love with this house and will definitely go back any chance I get. ",location
"Lauren was extremely responsive and the place was great. So easy to get to the beach, she provided a pack n play for us, and beach toys. Thank you for a wonderful stay.",clean
"Lauren was a great host, very responsive & thorough.  The furniture, decor, bedding was all top notch.  Having the extra outdoor space was a bonus, especially the rooftop.  We would stay here again.  ",clean
"The place was amazing and Lauren has been very responsive all the time. The house is very close to the beach and also close to the shops on Abbot Kinney. The kitchen was well-equipped and we had everything we needed. We also really enjoyed the big rooftop and would absolutely stay with Lauren again. The sidewalk that leads to the garage is a bit steep, so if you have car that's close to the ground it might scrape a bit on the bottom. Parking on the street is also no real problem though.",location
"An amazing house with a great roof deck! Location was perfect, very close to both AK and the beach. We enjoyed staying at Lauren's house for our Thanksgiving weekend with our family!",location
Super cool apartment. Excellent location. Totally recommended!,location
Very comfortable and ideal location!  Lauren and Trevor were very quick to respond to questions and allowed for a later check out (since our flight was in the evening).  Would definitely stay at this listing again.  ,location
Great location wonderful house Love the house. Looking forward to stay on next family vacation.,location
Beautiful house in a great area. Really good experience.,location
We loved staying at the house it was within walking distance of the beach Main St and Abbott Kinney <br/>We loved how versatile and accommodating the space was.<br/>We loved it so much we tried to extend our stay but a previous guest had booked it <br/>I am not at all surprised and we will be doing the same when we are back in LA <br/>Highly recommended and Lauren looked after all our needs super fast ,location
The house is beautiful and the 4 bathrooms is a plus.  Location is perfect just steps from abbot kinney where there are good shopping and dining.  ,location
"Easy to work with, streamlined process, would stay again",clean
"Lauren's place was fantastic. Great location, spacious, beautiful home, and amazing rooftop deck. Stayed here with 6 friends and we all felt like we had our own space but plenty of room to hang and eat together. Two blocks from the boardwalk and 3 blocks from Abbot Kinney. Lauren was very accommodating and responded quickly to any questions I had. Loved this place and would definitely stay here again.",location
"If you're looking for THE Venice experience than this is the place to stay for its proximity to Abbot Kinney and Venice Beach. It was perfect in size for me, my parents and sister's family (we each had our own bathrooms!) and the roofdeck was perfect for cookouts and dinner with friends. Kid-friendly and a garage were also plusses. Also nice to have thorough house instructions. Though I know the area well and visit often, the location and everything were made easy by our hosts. Missing the SoCal beach life already! ",location
"We absolutely loved Lauren's place! The photos are very accurate. Everything is just as described. I have 4 teen girls and we all had plenty of space ( the most we've ever had while traveling)!  Abbot Kenney is a short walk away - we ate at the Greenleaf twice and the the ice cream store - Salt and Straw - is fabulous! The beach is a couple of short blocks away. The house had towels and chairs to use. Having a garage is key because parking in the area is tight. As densely populated as the area is, the neighborhood is surprisingly quiet at night. All in all we had a wonderful stay and I would highly recommend Lauren's home!",location
Great location and amazing roof deck!,location
"First rate home, great location, extremely comfortable, spacious and convenient. A great find.",location
"Wonderful home, conveniently located to both the beach and Abbot Kinney, but on a quiet street.  As advertised and then some.",location
"We had a great stay at Laurens place! The house is as the pictures shows, even better. We used the rooftop terrace a lot. Two cars could be parked in the garage. Great to have beach towels and buggy boards handy, and a short walk to Venice beach and Abbot Kinney blvd.",location
The space and location are excellent. And having stayed in a few airbnbs worldwide these guys were by far the best hosts.,location
"We are so happy we found this place on such short notice and they were so helpful! The house is super close to the beach and around everything else . Abbott Kinney was a couple blocks away which we loved! We had a big group 9 adults, one 3yr old and a 3 month old and it was perfect! They had tons of beach supplies and toys for the kids! Thank you so much Lauren, we loved the your house so much! Will definitely stay again when we come back out!",location
This place is a quiet retreated nestled in the hills. It is a beautiful suite and a great place to stay. Ryan was quick to respond to any inquiries and check in was easy. There was everything we needed in the suite. I would highly suggest you book this Airbnb!,location
Wonderful location and extremely cozy. Modern and wonderfully clean. I wanted for nothing. Great place and highly recommended!,clean
Ryan did a great job communicating with us to ensure we had the best trip possible and was accommodating around changes. I would absolutely stay here again!!,clean
We really enjoyed our stay here. Ryan was super responsive and easy to get ahold of via text. The room was comfortable and had everything we needed for a few days visit. The road to get there was small and winding as is normal in the hills around there. It was really close to Pacific Highway and beaches as well.,location
"Loved this place! Great location, easy parking and a nice wide beach in front. I have become a big fan of carbon beach and this unit is a good reason to become one too. Bright, clean and quiet. Easy walk to the pier and to local shops and restaurants. Laundry in the unit. Keyless entry. Brent was on top of things and a pleasure to work with. <br/>I highly recommend it.",location
"The unit was as good as it looked in the pictures and the balcony was even better.   We enjoyed being right on the sand and with some nice privacy as well.  The beach was clean, not crowded and the weather was beautiful.    We had a terrific time and would definitely like to go back in the future.<br/><br/>Our host Renay was very kind and brought us some extra towels.  We had one small issue that Renay jumped on and fixed immediately which was terrific.",location
"Valerie's property was beautiful! Right on the water with the perfect beach vibe. The place was clean, cozy and lovely. Valerie was also really lovely in her correspondence and was quick to answer any questions I had. I highly recommend Suite 3 and definitely hope to stay again. Thank you Valerie! ",clean
"Absolutely beautiful house, just a few minutes walk to shops or the beach. Hosts were very helpful and responsive. Would definitely stay here again.",location
Loved it! It's in a fabulous location and fit our extended family comfortably. Ensuring all nine of us had room to ourselves when needed. And the short walk to Abbott Kinney was great.,location
"House was in a great location, very clean and tidy.  Had everything we could have possibly needed. We all really enjoyed our stay.  Would definitely recommend to others and would book again if we ever go back.",clean
The house worked really well for my wedding weekend. It was larger and cleaner than expected. We had seven people and had plenty of space for public gathering and private retreat. The roof top is an additional bonus. My guests loved the proximity to both the beach and restaurants/shopping. Overall a great stay.,location
Such a beautiful home! Very spacious and bright! A few steps from the beach and 25 minutes away (depending on traffic- we only went at night) from LA. Lauren and Trevor were so accommodating and helpful. I 100% recommend this Home!,location
"Beautiful place, in a fabulous location.  The place was very well-equipped and stocked.  It's literally a 3-4 minute walk to the iconic Venice beach in one direction and 3-4 minutes the other way to Abbott Kinney, a wonderful shopping location with kitchy boutique stores and such.  The Venice canals are maybe a 10-minute stroll (and well worth seeing).<br/><br/>Things we enjoyed:  The ""boardwalk"", which is really a concrete pedestrian/bike path all long the coastline.  We biked up to Santa Monica Pier one day, which was fun (I Segway'd, which was pretty cool if you've never done it);  The muscle guys doing their workouts at Muscle Beach; the amazingly talented kids at the skate park by the beach.  If you want a unique sushi experience, drive a couple of miles to Sugarfish in Marina Del Ray (no reservations accepted, expect to spend an hour waiting for a table, but worth the wait!).  Also, (Hidden by Airbnb) the Annenberg Beach House 10 minutes away in Santa Monica - if they have a ""pop-up open pool day"", take advantage!",location
"Lauren's home was perfect for our business team - great location, so close to Venice beach and great  shopping and restuarants.  Handy to airport and Santa Monica.  The house has a lot of private spaces for a group - and good communal spaces  too.  It is well equipped and lots of basics in the pantry which was much appreciated.  A very comfortable and stylish home, great beds and linen. We will book again on future trips.",location
"Location was great! Walking distance to Beach, coffee shops, gym, 20 minutes from Los Angeles Airport, a short distance to Santa Monica Pier. House itself is very unique built in 1990's three levels. Lower floor with one bedroom and private bath, second floor with living, Kitchen, bath and bedroom with two queen size beds. 3rd floor with master ensuite Plus one bedroom and hall bath. Rooftop patio and able to look over Venice California. If planning to cook then will need transportation to supermarkets although there are a couple of small food marts nearby that are walkable. If you have one vehicle it will fit into the garage just fine but if two  vehicles be prepared to search for parking on street. House is on corner of cross streets so you will hear vehicle in pedestrian traffic. If you you need four bedrooms this is a good choice.",location
Great location and spacious house! I highly recommend.,location
"Lauren's place was exactly as described and pictured. The house was big, bright and very clean. The location was perfect. It was close to Abbot Kinney and the beach. Lauren was quick to reply, and check in/check out was a breeze. I would definitely stay here again.",clean
"Amazing space, tight in the heart one every reason you would want to be in LA for !",location
The location of this house is amazing!!! Lauren and Trevor were great hosts and dealt with a few issues we had efficiently and effectively. The space for 6 of us was perfect and the rooftop terrace added an extra space for relaxing in the sunshine.,location
Great place to stay in Topanga!,location
"This place is as advertised, big, bright and beautiful.  If you want to visit Venice Beach with 4-10 people I highly recommend this place.  Perfectly located a couple blocks from the beach but far enough away for quiet nights.  Off street parking and the roof top patio are serious perks.  The place is huge and has many levels to it which makes it easy to find a quiet place to relax, even if you have a house full.  Lauren responded to my emails within minutes, always offering her help if needed.  Easy check in and out.  I'll be back!",location
"House is great, great location everything as dec<br/>Scribed. Would be happy to rent from them again!",location
"The location is great. Three blocks from the beach and two from Abbot Keaney, the  street with the trendiest shops in Venice. The house is very comfortable for large groups. Since the bedrooms are on different levels, each one has independence. Something to keep in mind is that the master suite and the other bedroom on the second floor cannot be completely obscured, so they are not suitable for people who cannot sleep with sunlight. The decoration is very nice also. You can tell it used to be somebodyâs home in opposition to other rent houses that are correctly decorated but lack that home feeling. <br/>If there was anything else to make it better the property has a rooftop terrace with a barbecue where you can enjoy sunny days gazing at the hills on one side and hearing the not so distant sea that lays a few blocks away to the other. <br/>To be fair, on the not so good side one can mention maintenance in general. Fridge is old and not thoroughly clean. Couch in living room needs some fabric cleaning as well and shower door in master suite bathroom does not close completely. All minor things that could be easily improved if sparing some rent days in favor of maintenance. Definitely the balance is positive. ",location
A great house for large groups minutes from the beach.  Large parking garage and ample street parking to boot.  Beautiful rooftop patio with bbq can make any night an enjoyable one.<br/><br/>Lauren's house made our Socal getaway super enjoyable and we'd stay there again!,location
"Great location and loads of space, we especially enjoyed the roof terrace!",location
"The home is very well located between beach-boardwalk and Abbot-Kinney's shopping-dining strip.  The home is spacious and unique. There are cool beach amenities provided by host (chairs, umbrellas and bikes). We did not have a car but there is a large garage to accommodate if you do. The rooftop patio is a wonderful place to relax day or night.",location
This is a great house who wants to close to Venice Beach. If you are a big group this is a excellent choice. Every detail in the house make you feel like your home. Terrace is a nice place to beign together and chat. It is quiet and safe neigborhood.,location
Great location and the roof top was an excellent space for gatherings.  Clean and large enough to accommodate a number of guests.,location

"Lauren's place is spacious and quiet. There's plenty of room for privacy and socialising, and it's perfectly located between Abbott Kinney and Main Street for all the shops and restaurants. There is some interesting artwork, but all in all the place was perfect for myself and my colleagues on our business trip. Lauren was also very flexible with our check out too, which was amazingly helpful. Would definitely recommend.",location
"Lovely and spacious in the best possible location for walking, dining, shopping, and of course the beach.  Lauren was responsive and was gracious enough to provide last-minute gear for our toddler!",location
This place is exactly as the pictures show! We had a great time. You will not be disappointed.,location
A beautiful place. Conveniently located within the heart of Venice Beach. Lots of room for everyone and well-stocked for a great stay. Communication was excellent and check-in/check-out was a breeze.,location
"The house made our New Years vacation so much better! The house was clean and roomy, fit our three couples perfectly. It is equally close to Abbott Kinney as it is to the beach, we really didnât need to rent a car. Lauren was so helpful and communicative throughout our stay.",clean
"We had a wonderful holidays at Trevor and Laurenâs place! The house was clean,had everything we needed. All as shown in the pictures. Great location,just literally in the âheartâ of Venice-2 min walk to the beach and 2 min walk to Abbot Kinney. Surround area is clean and very quite. We were with 2 kids and all was comfy for them.Trevor and Lauren were very responsive. Highly recommend this place!!! Thank  you guys one more time!",location

Amazing experience all around! Thanks for everything!,clean
"Amazing place, in a wonderful location. Highly reccomend!!!",location

"This is a really nice place. Super close to the beach and super quite at the same time. Very spacious, clean. The roof top is a killer.  The garage is large and very convenient if you have a car. The host is very responsive and nice. A great place for a family trip or for a group. We loved it!",location
"Thank you Trevor and Lauren, you have a wonderful house close to the beach.<br/><br/>All the best",location
"The house was a short walk to Venice boardwalk, Abbott Kinney and the Venice Canals. This 3 level plus a balcony home is a good choice for a group of 7-8 who like to have privacy on the trip. The roof-top balcony was comfortable. The hosts supplied sunscreen, body wash, books, dishwashing detergent, laundry detergent to make our stay more convenient.<br/><br/>The bedroom with the king size bed has 2 entrances.  One entrance does not have a door on it, but it did not cause any major problems during our stay.<br/><br/>I'd be pleased  to stay there again.",location
"The house itâs as showing in the photos.<br/>Clean , fully equipped.<br/>For familyâs itâs may be a noisy street at night specially at the weekends and be aware that there are a lot of homeless at the Venice area. <br/>The host very helpful and fast response.",clean
"This home was perfect for our extended family and far exceeded our expectations. We especially loved the master suite, and the immaculately clean bedrooms and bathrooms on multiple levels, afforded us all the privacy we needed. The common areas were so spacious and added to our comfort and the kitchen was well equipped. The rooftop area was a delightful spot to relax and read, enjoy the mountains in the distance and gather for meals and family time. <br/>Proximity to the beach, restaurants and to the eclectic shopping area on Abbot Kinney  was a plus! We enjoyed nearby Erwin Hotel rooftop for cocktails and amazing view of the ocean and great restaurants in Santa Monica, not to mention Universal Studios...<br/>Lauren is a great host, providing needs for our 2 year old granddaughter and responding very promptly to our questions and messages. We highly recommend this home; 5 stars all the way!",location
All around amazing experience! Perfect location.,location
Great location. Lots of fun local spots and great access to beach.,location
Laurenâs house is perfect for a nice stay at Venice Beach! The rooftop is great to chill and enjoy the sun. Highly recommend this place.,location
"There was an emergency situation with a previous AirBnB host that left us stranded 2 days before our trip to Venice Beach. Luckily we were able to find Lauren's home. If anything it was more of a blessing. We had a group of 10 (6 adults and 2 infants, 1 toddler, and a 3 yo). Lauren's home was able to comfortably accommodate my whole family. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left we felt right at home. Lauren's home also has lots of kid amenities, toys, 2 pack n plays, 2 high chairs, toddler strollers and beach toys. This was extremely convenient when packing. In addition the location was right in the center of Venice 5-10 min walk from the beach and abbot kinney (where most of the shops and restaurants are located). <br/><br/>The home looked exactly like the pictures on the rental page and very clean. Lauren and her partner were very responsive and her partner stopped by to ensure we were settling in fine. The one difficulty we had was with street parking so be cognizant of number of cars coming to the airbnb and available street parking. The home has space for 1 car in the garage so other cars will need to be parked in the street. We found it most efficient to only travel with one car at a time and to take the car in the garage when needed. We didn't travel much outside of Venice beach so that worked out well for us. If you want to stay in the Venice beach area with family I would highly recommend Lauren's place.",host
"House is in a great location, walk to many things including the beach. Held our family well. Each bedroom had its own bath, which makes a difference when everyone is trying to get ready at the same time. Would highly recommend.",location
"It's a wonderful house  is near Venice beach.<br/>There are four bathroom by each room, so it's very comfortable!",location
The house was wonderful for a large gathering and slept 8 adults comfortably. The space allowed us to host Thanksgiving dinner with local family members as well.<br/><br/>As a host Lauren was very responsive when we had a request.,space
"We had a wonderful stay: everything was comfortable, convenient, and just like the photographs and description. The welcome pack was filled with great restaurant recommendations and tips to enjoy the area.",clean
This place was great for our little kids for three weeks. More than enough space and lots of toys for them to play with as we were at house most days due to the Covid restriction. The rooftop patio with great shading was our favourite spot.<br/><br/>What really made the difference for us was Lauren's quick response and help when we had a microwave and freezer issue. They quickly brought a new microwave and had someone come over to fix the freezer.<br/><br/>We would gladly come back.,location
Very nice place to stay would recommend to friends,location
"Amazing place near the water, rooftop was amazing and lots of space",location
"Great place, great location....just 11/2 blocks to Venice Beach, a couple of blocks to the famous Abbot Kinney shopping. We really enjoyed our week of Thanksgiving with our family. <br/>Thank you Lauren!!!!",location
"Wonderful location, easily walkable to both shopping and the beach.",location
Great location for a beach holiday!! On a quiet street only minutes walk to the beach and Abbot Kinney... couldnât ask for a better spot! The rooftop is the best as well!!,location
"This home is everything you would hope it to be. Each of the bedrooms is large and unique in their own right, and the rooftop is an excellent congregating area. The hosts kept the house stocked (even had coffee filters & grounds for us). The location is right between Abbot Kinney and the beach, both a pleasurable walking distance. Our big notes are to put down the umbrella when youâre done using, as the winds pick up sometimes  given the proximity to the water; and if youâre bringing a car, you will need to pull into the driveway at an angle to avoid the bottom of your car scratching on the sidewalk, as the bottom of the garage + the street are quite steep compared to the height of the sidewalk. Otherwise, the house and stay was flawless.",location
HUGE! And exceeded our expectations! Such a lovely home with lots of personal space. We loved having coffee on the rooftop each morning. Close to Venice beach and Abbot Kinney shopping and food. Super clean and everything we needed was right there. Having the laundry was so convenient.,clean
Good Host! Communicative and got parole!,host
"Wonderful property, perfect location 5 minute walk from the boardwalk. Running, skating, biking, sunning, swimming! Minutes walking distance from great restaurants, shopping boutiques! Great for people who want to vacation and chill out, and not sit in traffic. Big enough property for privacy.",location
"Excelent house, very nice location, near to boardwalk of Venice Beach. Just a few minutes walking to restaurants, skating park, beach and shops. The house has a 4 bathroom and large rooms, an a  very good laundry area. The rooftop in summer time enjoying  the sunset is amazing. The comunication with Lauren always was very quick, in particular, we had a problem with the frezzer and he solved in less than two hours, he brought a new one. We had a wonderful stay.",location
Large airbnb in great location! Decor is a bit outdated but the location and roof made up for it. Hosts were very communicative.,location
"This is a great place with lots of space.  There are four separate bedrooms, each with its own bathroom.  Also three outdoor seating areas (roof, terrace off master bedroom and ground floor patio).  The garage was great and very convenient.  It is a very nicely decorated home and very comfortable.  Location is very close to Abbot Kinney and a few blocks from the beach.  There are a lot of stairs, so it may not be great for those with issues climbing stairs.  Communication with Lauren was a breeze and extremely smooth.  Loved this place!",location
"location, location, location. This is as central to Venice as it gets with an interesting layout and a wonderful roof deck. hard to beat a place like this.",location
Plenty of room to spread out. As advertised.,space
"This is a great home to stay in.  The rooms are all very large and bright, the location couldn't be better to walk to Venice Beach and Abbott Kinney, and the rooftop deck is true bonus.",location
Great location! Very relaxing and homy place.,location
"The pictures from Airbnb of this house looks new, but the actually house is like 20 years old. The wall is dirty, and there are scary paintings on the wall. Overall, it is a really bad house. DO NOT LIVE AT HERE!!!!!",clean
"We had a great time with our family at this Airbnb. Unfortunately the weather was terrible, so we couldn't enjoy the roof deck which had looked forward to. Water had infiltrated the lower level and we couldn't use that space, but the managers made it work for us. In good weather this place is great!",location
Place is big and in an awesome location.  It needs a detailed deep cleaning though and the furniture is worn off.. Very small living room for such a large house.  Only very small tv in living room.  One big tv in upstairs bedroom which has no doors.  None of the tvs are smart so you canât stream.  First floor has a funky smell maybe due to recent water damage.  For the price of this rental you would expect more but maybe it is all about location.,clean
Place is fantastic and great for large groups!,location
"The space was exactly as pictured and in a great location. It was picturesqueâ close to the beach, private, and quiet. The road up to the house is one lane and narrow, but we got used to it after a few times up and down the mountain. It was great that we could park our car in the driveway, coming and going as we pleased. The space is set up like a studio with a comfortable bed, a kitchenette, and bathroom. The room is very modern and bright, but blackout shades are available on each window for more privacy. Only one appliance (hair dryer, heater, microwave, etc.) should be used at one time or you might experience a power outage (as we did). However, Ryan was available to switch the power back on within a momentâs notice. The room is connected to the main house so we did hear some footsteps every so often, but it was not an issue. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and are thankful for Ryanâs hospitality!",location
"Fun location, just have to be a little brave driving around all those curves! Awesome space, great communication, would definitely stay again. Thanks for a great experience!",location
"Very lovely place, perfect for a secluded getaway but not to far from Malibu and the PCH. We really loved our stay here and would very much recommend it. Great price also!",location
"We had a wonderful stay at this gorgeous house close to the beach in Venice. Very bright, spacious and in mint condition on arrival with multiple spaces to relax in, read a book and take in the artwork. It was a great space to chill out in after a day of travelling around LA and the local area. Iâll definitely be recommending this Airbnb to friends while ensuring I stay there again some day.",location
Great place in a great location. Lauren was very accesible and accommodating.,location
Large and comfortable house very well located. Three min walk to abbot Kennelly blvd and 5min walk to the beach,location
"Kelley was great.  The unit has a great view and is in walking distance to 2nd street.  Parking was easy, especially when compared to other neighborhoods in Long Beach.",location
"Topanga Canyon is a peaceful easy feeling respite from a life of much ""activity"".   You will discover this rustic oasis hidden in the hills of Santa Monica and yet be amongst big named artists (such as Ryan), actors, musicians, creatives, aged hold out hippies and seekers enjoying a laid-back lifestyle.  Everything slows down here and eases into ""Topanga time"" mode.   Go to Mimosa CafÃ© (don't miss it) and  ""hang-out"" with the ""counter culture"" locals.  Hiking trails in all directions; some take you all the way down to the Pacific sea, the caves, Inn of the Seventh Ray, and babbling brooks which wind around bohemian-esque individualistic homes, all await you.   Prowl the canyons and you will be enraptured by their beauty.  I still see glimpses of the  Age of Aquarius here in Topanga.  Some still say it is a sacred place.  Ryan's spot is big it captures the essence of the Topanga vibe.  You will feel at ease here maybe ""just relax"". I know this is hard to do these days but here is the perfect oases/setting.   Book with Ryan in advance cause he is in demand and you will see why. <br/>Who knows, you may become a tree hugger too.",location

The suite had everything we needed and we felt completely at home.  Our favorite part was the terrace right over the water.  Communication with Valerie was a breeze.  We hope to come back again next year!",location
Valerie was a fantastic host and made the reservation easy. The place is fantastic too. I have stayed before. If you like to have the Malibu beach experience without the difficult parking or the beach that leads to nowhere then this is the place! You can walk to the pier and to the Malibu Beach Inn and have a great lunch and to other eats and shops and that's what Malibu living is all about.<br/>I will be back. Thank you Valerie!,location
"Valerie was very easy to get in touch with, and checkin was easy as pie! The unit had private parking and was in a fantastic spot close to the malibu pier, and lots of great restaraunts. The view is stunning, and the couch on the back porch instantly became my favourite spot. <br/><br/>My only small issues were with the bathroom, as I stood about a foot taller than the showerhead, and the laundry/dryer, as they are shared by other units, and we experienced some difficulty in getting coins to operate it, and find a time when no one else was using it. <br/><br/>Still, overall a great experience.",location
"This place is a gem! I reserved it for my parents when they came to town for my Dad's birthday. It has a lovely waterfront view, it's walking distance to 2nd Street, and has a beautiful balcony. Every time I came by, my parents were sitting out on that balcony watching the swimmers and kayakers  go by. The place was very clean, nicely decorated, and cozy. Five stars all the way!",location

Great place on the beach. The porch is heaven. Unit is extremely well kept and clean. Thank you for a great stay!,clean
This suite was absolutely amazing and just as pictured and described!  The suite is literally on the ocean and the location is amazing!  Literally a short walk away from the Malibu Pier and beach. My family very much enjoyed being able to get up and walk out onto the ocean to play in the water.  Great bonus was the fact that we did have our very own parking spot during our stay! <br/><br/>Valerie was a great host - very responsive and accommodating! I would absolutely recommend this place for anyone looking for some R & R on the ocean!  We loved this place/location so much - we're already planning for next year!,location
Amazing! Fabulous accommodation and everything you need. Waking up to the sound of the ocean really doesn't get any better.... Weekend return in a heartbeat. ,location

It's in a wonderful location   You can walk to Malibu Farms that has 3 restaurants right on the pier. We had reservations at Nobu which was also within walking distance. When it was time to leave, we didn't want to say goodbye. You couldn't find a better place to stay in Malibu. We will be back.  ",location

We love the clean simple decor and the super comfortable bed. Eat breakfast on the deck. It's a really nice view. We will be back again!",location
"This place is in the best possible location. It's clean and cosy. We could enjoy our morning coffees on the patio above the beach watching dolphins, seals and surfers. Equipment rental is close if you don't have your own boards. Central to nobu, the Malibu pier and carbon beach. Enjoyed our stay!",location
"We had a great weekend at Valerie's place! Could not be more convenient and relaxing. Nobu, the Pier and shops are all steps away. The balcony over the water with a covered lounge area is where we spent more our time. Easy communication and check in to. Thanks Valerie!",location
"Valerie was very accomodating and reponded to inquiries in a timely manner. The bungalow has a million dollar view and a nice rustic feel to it. Sleeping to the sound of the ocean is a dream. Top rated restaurants are minutes away. Overall, a great getaway location.",location
"Great place in the Malibu area, you can see the Malibu pier right from the balcony of the apartment which was the highlight of the place(the balcony)! You are bang on the ocean, so much so that it feels that the apartment is floating on water. Other than that the place is neatly maintained apart from a few minor issues which owner should fix (nothing that interrupts your beach house stay). Just one note, if you are planning to stay more than 2 people here, the couch/bed in the living room is uncomfortable with its springs gnawing into your back, but if you are just two people this place is perfect for a beach getaway! Valerie was very prompt and helpful in replying to any questions we had, before and during our stay. Thanks again for letting us stay in your place!",location
Everything went well Valerie was responsive and polite ,clean
"We had a wonderful stay at Valerie's place in Malibu. The unit was even better than pictured, very spacious and the little private deck is amazing, pictures do not do the view justice! We also loved the fire place in the unit. The location is perfect, set back from the road so you feel secluded, but walking distance to little restaurants and the Malibu pier. Valerie provided us with detailed information prior to our arrival so we were well prepared and was available by phone during our entire stay if we needed anything. We couldn't have asked for anything more and will certainly be back!",location

Valerie's place was fantastic. Amazing location. Super easy and fast communication for check-in. Over the top,location

"Prior to my arrival, communication was quick and pleasant. When I arrived on Saturday night, there was a vehicle parked in the spot designated for our unit. I messaged Valerie on airbnb, sent an email (which I later discovered failed to send), and also sent her a text message. I never received a response so I parked in another spot and left a note on my car. After am hour or so, with still no response from Valerie, the person in my spot contacted me and was very apologetic. He was concerned because he said Valerie was a nightmare to deal with. I told him I hadn't met her but she had been very pleasant in our communications. He warned me she wasn't. The following day, my son and husband arrived and called me to let me know they were there. There was only one spot for our unit, so they unloaded their luggage and my son pulled his truck off to the side to wait for me to come down and go with him to find parking off property. It was less than a minute from when he called me to when I got out to the parking lot and I could see as I approached that there was an issue. Valerie had approached my son, told him it was private property and he couldn't park there. He tried to explain that we were staying there and that he was waiting for me but when she asked for the unit number, he didn't know it so she told him she was going to have his car towed. As I approached, they both were out of their vehicles but next to the vehicles. I approached and heard her say she was calling the police, apparently because he was walking away from her to come get me. He responded call the f****** police. She screamed why are you cursing at me and he replies because you're being a b**** I walked up and told him to get in his truck and go, which he did. I tried to explain that we were staying there and that he was waiting for me. She repeatedly asked what unit we were in and I refused to tell her because I had no idea who she was or how it was her business. I turned and walked away from her as she was being rude and confrontational to me as well and she proceeded to yell that she was following me and calling the police. I demanded that she stop following me and told her to call the police as I was a paying guest and had every right to be there. She continued following me and was mere inches from my back. I faced her and told her to stop following me. I then asked her for her name and only then did I learn who she was. I then stated that I stated that we had been communicating all week and noted that...",clean

The water is literally at your feet! The sound of the waves are very peaceful and offer a proper local Malibu experience! Valerie was also very good with communication. Check in was so easy and if we had any questions, she answered within a few hours! Could not recommend this Airbnb enough!",location
"This place was dreamy. Someone walked up to me while I was laying on the beach to ask what it's like to live in such a great apartment. The water is so beautiful, view is beautiful, apartment was the cutest. It looks to be a really old place that's been renovated so it has tons of character. Close enough to the pier to grab a $30 breakfast sandwich and a mimosa or walk to Nobu for cocktails. The location is great, close to grocery stores and restaurants. The only thing I was a tad disappointed about was the sunset cannot be seen from here. I for some reason thought the sunset would be out the back door so we had to go looking for it. And there's a pretty significant ant problem. We had to keep everything in the fridge and towels left on the floor as a mat is covered in ants the next morning. Other than that.... amazing!!",location

We will 100% be back! xx",location
"The home was beautiful and as described, the best part was being on the oceanfront of a private beach :)",location
"Overall feel - this place is way too expensive for the quality of the apartment you get.  <br/>Cons: 1) Entrance to the building is dirty and not maintained. 2) Apt is really expensive for low quality 3) There is no insolation, while it felt amazing to hear the ocean, it felt horrible to hear the loud traffic from the street overnight and early morning 4) Mattresses are old 5) Sofa bed is extremely uncomfortable (old generation of sofa spring mattress). Don't count sleeping on it 6) Plumbing system not working properly (for the price it does not make sense). Hot water flow is low and burning (one of our party burn himself under the shower) 7) Bathroom appliances are not well maintained (paint missing, scratches, yellow stain on bathtub) 8) Very difficult to raise window blinds (what is the point to have windows with ocean views if customer cannot raise the blinds?) 9) Balcony blinds are falling apart. <br/><br/>Pros: 1) Location (you pay for the location, that is it) 2) Communication with host was good 3) Apartment design/deco is cute but hiding the misery. <br/>",location

The location is more stars than are available on this review site.  Just a short walk from charming 2nd Street with so many restaurants to choose from.  And on the front deck, which stretches the width of the apartment, are two comfortable chairs from which you have front row seats to the runners, dog walkers, swimmers, paddlers, rowers and luxury boats that provide constant water and land interest.<br/><br/>Since we were there over the Christmas holidays, the lighted trees in the bay were a nightly pleasure.  You can also see them from your very comfortable Murphy bed... and watch the sunrise.  A comfy couch and a chair so comfortable we'd like to find one like it make this a relaxing place.  <br/><br/>There were things for breakfast... and if I had felt like cooking on vacation, plenty of condiments and all of the appliances to make that possible in a very adequate kitchen.  <br/><br/>Kelley communicated quickly and with all the information we needed.

Adorable small place right off of the beach in the heart of Malibu. It is close to all of the shops and great restaurants. Valerie was very quick to respond and the location was very easy to find.,location
Place was wonderfully quaint with amazing beach views.  My only suggestion is a new sofa bed mattress.  Otherwise we loved it!,location
Right on the beach. Close to everything. Amazing space. Great for couples or families. Second time here and we will be back.,location
"Fantastic location and apartment, we had a terrific vacation!",location
"Valerie's place is amazing!   The view and ocean waves crashing on the beach don't get better than that.  It's a short walk to the pier and beaches and there's plenty of awesome marine life that can be seen right from the deck like whales, dolphins and seals.  Many great restaurants and shopping nearby also.  Perfect location in general.  I would stay there again and again!  <br/>Lu Ann",location
"Cannot get better than this in terms of location and vicinity to the water. It is a walking distance to the Malibu pier, a couple of minutes from the plaza and steps from the water.<br/><br/>We stayed in the property for 4 nights in mid-April.<br/><br/>The entrance to the complex is a bit obscure. The apartment is hard to find as it is hidden under a tree so make sure to get good directions.<br/><br/>It was nicely furnished with the exception that there were a lot of stains on the beautiful sofa. Cleaning lady should clean them and agent should provide stain remover in case guests leave a mark.<br/><br/>The kitchen was nicely equipped and we love the microwave. But there were not enough garbage bags. If you would be staying for more than a couple fo days you need to think about bags and perhaps your own towels and sheets.<br/><br/>There were some aunts running around nothing that would bother adults but my two kids freaked out and would not go into the kitchen.<br/><br/>Although the audio and visual equipment had Apple TV, smart TV, and direct TV almost none worked. Even the Netflix on the smart TV would not launch. Our family was looking forward to family night movie nights which never happened.<br/><br/>The deck is nice and has adequate furniture. We loved it when we could sit outside although for two days we experienced a great deal of wind.<br/><br/>Overall, we loved the property but did not have a good experience staying there.",location
"My stay at 22802 PC Hwy was absolutely breathtaking and refreshing. I was pleasantly surprise by the quaint, unique space and beautiful view of the ocean.  I fell asleep to the waves crashing on the rocks nightly and peace filled the clean, spacious atmosphere. The cottage was near to Nobu and V's which are incredible and popular restaurants. I felt safe, relaxed, and in good spirits while staying here. The view of the ocean and sound of the waves will forever be etched in my heart.....",location
"This place was the perfect spot for our vow renewal getway. The place lived up to the pictures, loved that it was right next to the ocean and the waves never stop, it was like sleeping next to a sleep app, haha. The communication ended up being great and the host was accommodating if something we wrong. I would reccomend this place, note, we stayed in april so I do not know what it feels like in the summer.",location
Amazing 2 night stay.  I would highly recommend and will definitely be back :),location
"Beautiful spot, wonderful communication. Highly recommend!",location
Location location location. The place is perfect for a 3 night getaway. The place is as advertised and communication excellent. you park and do not have to drive anywhere if you do not want to. everything is walking distance. we will be back,location
"This perfectly situated balcony loft has a perfect sunrise view of the enclosed inlet beach. The beach just across the street is one of the cleanest I have ever been to. The loft is a very conformable and cozy space with modern furniture and a perfectly designed kitchen space. I really liked the hot shower and bathroom, plenty of water pressure and easy to keep clean. This is the perfect beach access getaway for a single or couple looking for a value along the shoreline.",location
"Great host and Location, I definitely enjoyed watching the sunrise on the balcony with a cup of coffee.  The pad is facing the San Jacinto Mountains (east) right off the Alamitos bay canal and steps from the beach, restaurants and bar on 2nd street.",location
"Place is so little but it looks right onto the (Website hidden by Airbnb) it doesn't matter.  2nd Street and Naples are walking distance for eating and shopping. Only negative I had is the Murphy Bed , is uncomfortable.....I slept on the couch way more comfy . Besides that ..... everything was great. Kelley is quick to respond and very nice.",location
Another great stay in Belmont Shores.,location
"Perfect location (3 doors down from NOBU) + perfect view (dolphins playing) + Malibu Pier in walking distance + gracious host + clean, stylish home + kick-back deck time + roaring fire = amazing vacation!!  Canât wait to return!!",location
"If you want a true ocean front getaway, this is the place.  Couldnât be any closer to the ocean.  It was great!",location
"We really enjoyed our stay in Malibu. Weâve always had a dream of staying right on the beach! Everything we had read about was true and accurate. My six year old daughter couldnât believe our amazing views of the ocean.  It was a great value for being in Malibu. We also loved the white, beachy decor. Weâll be back!",location
Suite 3 provided a picture postcard experience  of Malibu. We didnât want to leave the balcony to go for dinner!<br/><br/>The accommodation was crisp white and clean including the impeccably clean white sofa.<br/><br/>The beds were comfortable and the sofa bed made even more so by a thick memory foam mattress topper.<br/><br/>The hosts were very professional prompt and efficient.<br/><br/>Thank you for a great stay. <br/><br/>Jane and family,clean
This place is perfect and very cute. The perfect beach apartment overlooking the water. Itâs done shabby chic and has a full kitchen that made it nice to cook breakfast and look out over the ocean below. There is private access to the beach which is perfect for a secluded day of relaxing. Just watch for high tide it might get your stuff a little wet. The unit has a/c too which is a plus. Valerie and Cruz were very quick to respond and also were helpful as we left some valuable items and they immediately notified us to return them to us. What a gem this place is.,location
This place is absolutely magnificent. We tried to stay an extra night because of how beautiful the location/place was. Unfortunately it was already booked so we could but we will undoubted come back to this place. ,location
Another fabulous stay in Malibu. Loved the accommodations...a perfect getaway. I canât wait to come back!,location
The apartment is very comfortable and the view is stunning. A great value in a prime location!,location
"Malibu is definately a lovely place and the flatâs location is best situated: private access to the sandy beach and just a 5 minutes walk to the famous Malibu Pier. Some great restaurants and clubs are located close (walking distance) to the lodge, however no noisiness due to their âneighbourhoodâ. While the exterior is a little aged, the interior of the flat is very clean and modern. Overall we really appreciated our time in Malibu and wld highly recommend to our friends. ",location
We were very happy to have stayed here. The views and proximity to the beach are amazing and the hosts were great. We'll definitely come back here!,location
"Thoroughly recommend staying here itâs a magical experience and a fantastic location, the waves are magnificent ð",location
Lovely place and the location could not be better.,location
Awesome place! Great location!! Definitely recommend staying here!,location
beautiful location for a weekend retreat,location
"Great spot, awesome location! Couldnât have been better for our needs in Malibu",location
The suite is absolutely lovely.  The view is amazing and within walking distance to many restaurants.  Would definitely stay here again.,location
Amazing apartment on the beach. Great for families. We spent Thanksgiving here and the apartment had everything needed to cook a full Thanksgiving meal. This is our 4th time staying at this apartment. Amazing as always.,location
Valerie was a super thoughtful host. Her apartment was everything and more. Will definitely stay again!,clean
The suite is absolutely lovely. The view is amazing and within walking distance to many restaurants. Would definitely stay here again.,location
Great apartment for a couple looking for a true Malibu experience.,location
Very simple but carefully designed -<br/>It is just perfect in every way. Great location. I hope to return soon.,location
"Incredible place right on the water, near the pier and situated perfectly.  Our stay was incredibly romantic and this property was exactly what we were looking for.  Clean and cozy with a view thatâs spectacular.  Communication was quick and the check in/out info was super clear and these hosts very accommodating.  We will be back for sure!",location
I enjoyed my stay at Valerieâs apartment. The location is amazing - right next to Nobu in Malibu. The unit overlooks the water which is really nice.,location
"Great spot, great location. The Pacific never disappoints.",location
"This place is truly incredible. The space is super clean, relaxing, and it is literally on top of the water. There is no other place in Malibu that you should consider. Not a hotel across the highway (no offense to those properties), not another airbnb up the hill or out of town, but HERE. Staying on top of the water was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience and felt like we were on the edge of the world. Invest in yourself, relax on the porch, and splurge for this beautiful one bedroom place at all costs. The area is quiet and private. The only noise you can hear is the rush of waves right outside your window, and I have never slept so hard as I did here. <br/><br/>The fridge, microwave, and nice TV (for when the sun went down) were excellent to have on site. We walked to V's for italian food Saturday night, incredible. Nobu is walking distance, as is the Malibu pier. THIS is how you stay in Malibu. A private parking space was immensely valuable and convenient.",location
"Beautiful on the inside. Great for a couple to stay, not 4 adults. Would be nice if check out time was noon.",location
Great location and views!!. Valerie was great with instruction and responding to questions.,location
Great views and a very nice and clean apartment.,location
"We spent 12 nights at Suite 3 and frankly, it was a mixed experience. When we book an Airbnb with a 5-star rating, a âSuperhostâ and a $500 nightly rate, we would expect the place to be top notch and well-maintained. We pulled into the parking lot, found our parking space, but struggled to locate our unit --- the directions were not clear and the building does not have a street number on it. As we walked through the exterior space to find our unit our hearts sank. âSeedyâ is the only way to describe this apartment complex. It is not well-maintained, to say the least. The staircase was dirty and the steps were covered with downed palm leaves, the handrail had bird droppings and other dirt. The steps down to the beach (once you eventually find them), are buried in sand, and no one ever swept them off the entire time we were there. As we walked past individual apartments to reach Unit Three there were shoes, towels, surf equipment, etc slung all over the railings. The building was rundown, rusty and pretty unsavory. <br/><br/>Once we got into the apartment, it was pretty much as the photos showed, and generally met our expectations. The kitchen is very well-equipped (nice stove), but the bathroom is tiny and not updated (stained tub/shower with very poor water pressure). The bedroom is fine, but lights from the exterior walkway shine in all night. We were there in winter, and it is a good thing there was a gas fireplace, because the wall heater in the living room stopped working halfway through our stay. Sara came at our request and supposedly re-lit the pilot, but it never turned on again. There was no heat for the bedroom or bathroom, and they were cold. <br/><br/>There is a lot of noise from the other tenants in the building --- a television that plays loudly all evening, a small dog that barks a lot, and a washing machine (apparently in the unit below) that violently shakes the entire apartment when it goes into the Spin cycle. <br/><br/>Carbon Beach is a treasure of a beach, and access to the beach is certainly valuable. However, if you are booking this location know that this is no â5-starâ accommodation. Itâs a run-down apartment building with a nicely furnished apartment if you can ignore all the rest of your surroundings.",location
Wonderful home. Perfect Malibu location! Fell asleep every night to the waves. No sound machine needed!,location
"This apartment is incredible! So chic & cozy & with the most insane views of the ocean. Falling asleep to the sound of waves crashing, watching the sun rise & set...we were in heaven. If you want to have the most relaxing vacation of your life, stay at this magical place!",location
"Amazing location, great access to the beach and loved the private outside space. Would definitely stay again!",location
Great place! Very clean and an outstanding location!!  Ryan was super helpful and communicated with us regularly!   The drive to his place was spectacular!,clean
"Very tidy and lovely AirBnb apartment equipped with everything you need, and conveniently located between Malibu and the LA area. Communication with Ryan was super easy and quick, and the place looks exactly like it does in the pictures. Would definitely recommend - it's a great option for a nice southern CA getaway!",clean
We had a great stay! Perfect little place for two. Great location!! Close to everything!,location

Paradise Topanga ist located next to Santa Monica and very close to LA. Ryan was a perfect host and helped us out in every situation. Super fast and super easy to communicate with! Absolutely perfect!,location
"This was an amazing spot, overlooking the Pacific Ocean with great views up and down the coast. It was so nice being close to Malibu Pier, a grocery, and a few food options. We didn't have to drive the whole time we were staying at the apartment, which is pretty excellent given Southern California's notorious traffic. The space was much nicer than I expected, given the age of the apartment building. I highly recommend staying here if you're wanting to soak in some sun and fun. The host was super responsive and check-in/check-out process was smooth.",location
"Perfect spot right by the ocean, couldnât have been happier with our stay. Thank you!",location
Perfect in so many ways!,clean

Perfect as usual. And thanks for the late checkout!,clean
"Kelly was a great host and very accommodating. Amazing location. Beach on bay across the street, main beach just two blocks away, 2nd street with amazing shops and restaurants just around the corner. Enjoyed the outside patio and beautiful views.",location
For an oceanfront getaway in a clean and well decorated place with all the amenities - this is it!,clean
Terrific location and amazing views from the balcony!,location
Great to be on the water and hear the waves crashing.,location
"Nice place in Malibu, right on the water with good view to the pier. The building is a typical old style Malibu wood construction, but the apartment is well maintained, cleaned and convenient for a good dinner at Nobu.",location
"Beautiful, very clean, and cozy! Would stay again.",clean
"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Great location on the beach. Listening to the surf day and night. Watching dolphins. Close proximity to Malibu Pier and Village, with access to Whole Foods and breakfast/coffee outlets. Apartment was clean and comfortable. Host was very responsive to queries.  Easy access to LAX. Very relaxing start to our Californian adventure.",location
"We absolutely loved, loved, loved the place.  Such a gem of a beach house and so well-situated. Loved the furniture and fittings, and the white color scheme was apropos and relaxing. Everything was âjust so.â  And the view was to die for, of course, as was the sound of the waves.  Canât say enough good things about the place!  Weâll be back. <br/><br/>The review wouldnât be complete without a word about the host.  She was responsive, helpful, and gracious, and certainly deserves her place as an Airbnb âsuper host.â",location
"One of our favorite stays to date ! We canât wait to come back and make it a tradition- my finance is a doctor and rarely gets to relax, and this place was so charming, calm and exactly what we needed all with an ocean soundtrack! Amazing",location
"It is a great location for surfing or ins pictures. Suite 3 is upstairs, not convenient for taking big luggage up and down. Nice view by the patio, and I love to hear the roar sea. The only thing is too pricey, but itâs Malibu.",location
This place is magic. There is no price to stay quite in front of the ocean.<br/>I will come back soon,location
Great location. Oceanfront. Walking distance to pier and restaurants. Comfortable space. Clean and cozy.,location
"The location is top-notch and the views are insanely beautiful. We were able to walk to restaurants and we enjoyed being right on the beach. That being said, the unit leaves a bit to be desired and doesnât seem to be up to Airbnb Plus standards. We didnât have enough shampoo, and the shower wasnât working properly. We made the most of it, though, and still had a great trip.",location
Astoning moment to be able to wake up watching the Pacific Ocean<br/>It has been a great experience to stay here<br/>Flat is perfect to enjoy the sun of Malibu<br/>Host was very flexible and caring,location
Most beautiful destination to stay. You just canât beat those views!,location
We have stayed here over half a dozen times. Amazing. Thereâs no better place I. Malibu!,location
"Return guest. Better than last time. Sad the nearby grocery is gone, but walk to Whole Foods was fine. I love this place and will be back again. It was just what I needed for a writing retreat weekend.",location
"The location is perfect and it was wonderful to sit out on the balcony.  Even though we were very jet lagged, being close to the Pacific Coast Highway never bothered us as the sound of the waves completely masked it.  The plumbing (shower) is not great but otherwise the apartment was just like the photos and we enjoyed our time there.",location
"A very cosy, quaint and lovely place for a short stay.... The view is amazing and the sound of the waves at night and in the morning makes it even more worthwhile..... highly recommend especially to anyone who wants a short getaway....",location
"A wonderful find on the beach in Malibu, very near the Malibu Pier and my favorite breakfast restaurant at the Malibu Beach hotel (a short walk along the beach, which has a wonderful outdoor patio overlooking the beach for breakfast, great also for business meetings)!  Valeries place is right on the beach, very clean and bright - with an outdoor patio and chairs for watching their amazing sunrises and sunsets!  Great find at a reasonable price!",location
"Great space, great view ,in a great area. Iâll definitely be looking to stay here again in the future.",location
This is a great place if you love the sound of the ocean waves and a beautiful view of the ocean. The place was literally on top of the ocean. Super clean and tidy too. my only complaint is the service was real bad there so unfortunately i wasnt able to use certain amenities like wifi smart tv etc cuz of poor reception. Also the plumbing is old so thereâs absolutely no water pressure in the shower which is irritating in my opinion + everything in area is kinda expensive to order food & u cant even order dominos/pizza hut theres none in area lol but other than that pretty cool place. I will give it 3/5 just cuz of the beautiful setting,location
This is our 6th time at this Airbnb. Always perfect!,clean

"Stayed two nights in Ryan's place and the location was very close to Santa Monica, Malibu and LA.

Very accurate :)<br/>Ryan was very helpful and very quick replying the messages. Thanks Ryan!",location
A great place to stay in. Ryan was very responsive & helpful. The accommodation had a fully equipped kitchen and all the amenities we needed for our short stay. Would love to stay there again!,clean
"Ryanâs space is perfectly tucked away in the mountains of Topanga, which is a 10-15 drive from Malibu and about 45 minutes to Los Angeles area during the day. The spot is roomy yet cozy, and is ideal for those looking to take a break from the hustle and bustle of LA. Would recommend, also Ryan was very accommodating and made sure we had everything we needed.<br/><br/>Thanks again Ryan!",location
"We had such a great stay and felt right at home.  Location is perfect,  especially if you have little ones because of the clean sandy beach just steps away.  Being able to sit on the patio and see the water was great.  This will definitely be a repeat location for us",location
"Ryan is an awesome host! My boyfriend and I are all the way from New Jersey and weâre very lost, but Ryan gave us his phone number and was very cool  about speaking to us over the phone and helping us navigate through the neighborhood! He even offered to meet us in person to help us out! When we got to his place, it was beautiful and he left everything we needed in the house for us to be comfortable. He even included local places for us to go! The check in and check out process was very laid back. We want to come back and stay at this exact location. Also, the location was beautiful and had an awesome view, and was very close to Malibu and Santa Monica beaches!",clean
Ryanâs place was an absolutely perfect place in Topanga. I wouldnât hesitate to stay again.,location

Incredible spot in the heart of malibu- walking distance to tons of restaurants. The beach is private so not as many people on it! Place was super clean- and the balcony was the highlight. Didnt even really need to go down to the beach considering we were on top of the water.,location
"Literally Perfection! I grew up in Malibu and have since moved inland to the valley. I needed a get away and this place is in a prime location, has the perfect private beach, great amenities (including great coffee), and is super clean! The balconies and beach are the true standouts.  Cruz responded quickly to allll of my questions wand was great. â­ï¸ â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸<br/><br/>My new rule of thumb: memorize the door lock combo! I peeped out to check a car that had an alarm going off and the ocean breeze slammed the front door shut. It was a total hilarious movie moment. Standing there in a bikini, no shoes, no mask, dead phone in hand and no way in ð",location
Exactly as described,clean
Wonderful place! Great hospitality and responsive.,location
Really great spot and the view canât be beat. There are few things cooler than relaxing with the Pacific Ocean waves breaking under the deck youâre sitting on. Was a great time.,location

"Absolutely awesome place! Beautiful oceanfront on ""private beach"" meant no huge crowds. The suite is well stocked and beautifully appointed. Kids had a ball and parents too. Would just recommend you bring cleaning products. Noticed fingerprints on microwave panel, stains on toilet seat and other cleaning oversights that I probably wouldn't have noticed if we were in normal times. Nevertheless, highly recommend!<br/><br/>**Also, the suite is steps away from Nobu and Carbon Beach Club, both are topnotch restaurants in LA and did fast pickup.",location
Great view - nice place - communication about parking spots etc can use some improvement.,location
We rented this beautiful gem for a little birthday celebration. It was absolutely perfect. Very cozy and romantic! Loved the fireplace and crushing waves sounds together! Definitely a perfect place for a little romantic get away!,location
It felt as if we are on a ship! At high tide we were adrift in the ocean. Such a treat. Fell asleep to the sound of the waves and watched dolphins playing while I drank my morning coffee. What more could you ask for?,location

We had a lovely stay - will be back again soon!,location
I was in unit 3. The building itself is not great at all. There are other units that are a lot nicer according to my friend who was the one who told me to stay here as she had a great stay. Unfortunately I got a more rundown building and unit. Was still a great location.  Should ask host for specific unit you are getting.,location
A hidden gem! Location Location Location. Can not wait until my next visit.,location
"If Iâm ever staying in Malibu, itâll be here! What a great stay. Literally fell asleep and woke up to the waves every morning. Heavenly spot! Stay here stay here stay here!",location
Overall we had a great stay. Slight inconvenience with the sofa sleeper but that was quickly resolved. The location can not be beat - literally right on the beach! It was so nice going to sleep and waking up to the sound of the waves. Host was responsive and accommodating.,location
"Things I would like to disclaim to whoever that is interested in this place: YOURE PAYING FOR THE VIEW AND THE PRIVATE BEACH.<br/><br/>The view is spectacular and the option of being on a private beach is amazing because thereâs really not much people around on the beach. I loved that, and am convinced that was why I spent so much money to go.<br/><br/>Do I think it was worth the money?<br/><br/>I donât think the host did anything wrong. In fact, the place was as clean as it can get and checking in was such a breeze. Communication was prompt when I needed.<br/><br/>However...<br/><br/>Keep in mind that a lot of furniture and things in this Airbnb is a bit run down, there were things that were broken or was very old.<br/><br/>Although you get the suite to yourself, you also have to keep in mind the suite is located in a cluster of other suites and you can literally hear someone coughing or laughing in the other suites.",location
Great spot on the water that was everything we expected.,location
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Cruz's place. The highlight of this place was definitely the balcony overlooking the beautiful ocean and the private access to the beach. Amenities were all clean and the bed was soft and comfortable. One thing to keep in mind is that the complex itself was a bit rundown and could use some updating. Other than that, we had a great time during our stay!",location
Absolutely MAGICAL!,location
"Spent a couple of nights here and it did not disappoint. Pretty much as pictured- the only thing Iâll say is that the bathroom is a little small regarding counter space/towels. Otherwise the view is to die for- right on the beach, hearing the waves crashing all day and night. Very close to shops and restaurants- we walked to everything without any problems. We loved our little getaway during this quarantine. Everything was clean. No real complaints would book here again. Thank you Cruz!",location
Excellent view! Enjoyed our stay!,location
This place was great. Literally right next to the beach and a quiet/private area. Cruz laid out the specifications of this place and made it easy for us during our stay.,location
"We loved our stay in Malibu! Suite 3 is the perfect beach getaway! It doesnât get much better than being oceanfront! On our first evening, we noticed the pull out couch was broken. Cruz had a handyman come out right away. Unfortunately the pull out was unable to be fixed during our stay, so Cruz purchased a blow up mattress and issued us a credit for the inconvenience. <br/>We would love to return to this spot again!",location
It was a perfect get away/stay-cation during this crazy time in our world! <br/>I will be going back next month!,location
"This place was amazing! Being right on a swimable, walkable beach in Malibu was awesome. Location is great for all the best spots in Malibu--minutes from Cross Creek, doors down from Nobu. We loved it!",location
"We had an outstanding staycation. The location was perfect! The view was breathtaking. Overall, the condo was cute, and clean. I am definitely booking again.",location
"Ryan's place is on a mountain. It's just simply beautiful! We enjoyed the stylish and comfortable apartment and it was super clean. After we dropped our things off, we went to a quaint wine bar that Ryan had on his local tips sheet.  It was super yummy.  We enjoyed the location of this place because it was near a beautiful state park AND the beaches. My daughter and I had such a nice time.",location
The drive to the property was a little scary but the guesthouse is worth it. The hosts have everything you would possibly need ready for you when you check in.  I highly recommend this Airbnb,location
"Incredible place, near the beach and in the midle of the Topanga Reserve. Ryan is the better host ever! We coud stay 4 hours more in the House waiting Four our flight. <br/>The peace of This place is georgeous",location
"The room was a lot better than expected. It had full amenities and very comforting. The host was also very welcoming and helpful to assist in my stay. The only problem would be the drive to get the location. It is in Topanga Canyon which has many hills and sharp turns. It was a lot of driving. If you are a capable a driver you should be fine, as the hills to get to the place are steep. But other than that the place was great!",location
"Really cute and comfy place :) Ryan is an amazing host !! The location is great and quiet, perfect to spend the day in the city and rest afterwards. I recommend it  a hundred percent :)",location
"This place is awesome! Itâs really nice and clean just like in the photos. It was also nice and cool even though it was hot outside. I can also really recommend staying up in the mountains like this instead of down in the city, itâs an entire different (and better) experience. And Santa Monica and Malibu is so close so itâs not a long drive at all. <br/>And Ryan is a great host who makes you feel very welcome, he also provides a lot of different things in the room you might need during your stay.",clean
"Fantastic accommodation, very very clean and comfortable, and a friendly responsive host. Definitely need a car if staying in the hills area.",clean
Ryan has been an awesome host. His quiet and thoughtfully furnitured place is an ideal starting point for exploring L.A. and the beaches north of L.A.,location
Calm place in a beautiful landscape. Up in the mountains and still less than half an hour away from the Malibu surf. Excellent price-quality ratio. Loved it.,location
"This was such a quiet little sanctuary away from the noise and crowds of Malibu. Easy access down to the center of Malibu (about 15 minutes), but the perfect place to relax in the evenings. Ryan was so helpful & has just the cutest family. The space was perfect - so stylish & with extra amenities like beach goodies & high-quality coffee! Definitely recommend - and yes, Uber does service the area, even though it's tucked up in the mountains!",location
"Beautiful Airbnb, really clean and stylish. Prime location only a short drive to Malibu, Venice beach and Downtown LA. Would definitely recommend if youâre wanting to explore the coast.",clean
"Ryanâs place was great! It was just was I was looking for and in the middle of everything. The only thing is once you get closer to the location the road narrows quiet a bit. However, you get used to it fairly easily and it is not a car busy area. Thank you for everything!",location
Very comfortable and isolated suite. Ryan was very quick to answer any questions I had and also made suggestions for places I should visit! Definitely recommend this place for a calm getaway,clean
Very nice place for a couples getaway.... Host was very nice and helpful.,location
"Totally amazing location, with a nice beach across the small road. Lots of really nice restaurants in the neighborhood, and lots of nice areas for walking around, e.g. on Naples island. The place is not too big, but the fold out bed works well. The terrace is amazing, breakfast with a view towards all the activities on the water. The place would improve from a thorough cleaning (and not just surface cleaning), esp. considering the price tag. Kelley is fast in responding and nicely let us spend half a day on the ground floor patio when we were waiting for our flight to leave.",location
Great view and location.,location
We have stayed at Kelleyâs place a couple of times now and each time Kelley has made us feel very welcome!  The location is amazing and is easy to use for a family!  We love staying at Kelleyâs at place and highly recommend this apartment !,location
Awesome location!,location
"Amazing location and views from the balcony and whole studio! Prompt responses and easy check in and out. Exactly as advertised, would highly recommend",location
FABULOUS LOCATION!   Great little spot right on beach. Easy to find parking on street. Great value. Would absolutely stay here again.,location
"Amazing host, location and everything we expected it to be and more!",location
"Great view, great location, close to restaurants!",location
Kelley was super fast in responding communication and provided extra help to make our stay comfortable. Ocean view from window was amazing that we decided to stay in the room instead of exploring just because of it. Neighbor was very nice too.,location
What a view! Adorable apartment. Kelley is a very thoughtful host. I will definitely be back!,location
Isolated spot right up the beautiful Topanga Canyon. Just a few minutes from Topanga beach which was pretty empty so it felt more private. The space was sparkling clean and easy to enjoy. The place you stay is separate from the family house so it feels like your own.,location
"We had a great stay in Topanga, very close to Malibu & thereâs some great little shops and a pizza restaurant just down the road if you have a car. Only issue was the very weak shower pressure but otherwise a very peaceful place to stay in the mountains :)",location
"Ryan's place.. Oh my. It's a hidden gem. <br/>It's located in the mountains of the pacific coastal highway. Challenging crooked roads leads up to this amazing apartment underneath the main house. <br/>It has everything that is described and it looks just like in the pictures, but better in real life. <br/>Great place for parking. I could fit a Ford F150.<br/>Ryan was so nice and contacted me with driving instructions upon arrival and told me of a road closer that was coming and how to bypass the closed road. <br/><br/>If you want a place away from all the drama, this is the place to be!",location
"Ryan's place is lovely, very modern and homely and of course in amazing Topanga which is so worth a visit. We loved being so close to the ocean and Malibu. Thank you Ryan.",location
This spot in Malibu is magic. We stayed during a heat wave in Los Angeles and it was the perfect way to escape the heat. The place is great and the location is excellent.,location
Had a great stay here with my girlfriend for our anniversary. Would love to come back in the future.,location
"This place is amazing! I just love waking up to the sound of the waves slamming into the shore! This is the perfect beachfront house in Malibu. I canât believe its just right next to the beach. And the place is very clean. My daughter approved of this place! Overall, it was a great time.",location
"Cruz was an INCREDIBLE hostâ the space is breathtaking. Whatever peace youâre looking for, itâs here.",location
"We loved it!  Already planning when we can go back!   What a beautiful beach right out the door!  Went running and walking every day.   Lovely charming, shabby chic feeling decor.   Deck perfect for reading.   Truly felt like we were on vacation even though we live in Los Angeles.",location
"Enjoyed our stay. Perfectly located, and Cruz answered all my questions before and during check in. Would absolutely stay again.",location
The location is great. The house is clean and provided many extra towels which was very nice!,clean
My second stay at this condo. Perfect location and perfect space! Will be back again!,location
Great Location with a Great host! Beautiful view! Convenient checkin prime location between Nobu and Malibu Beach Inn. Hope to be back soon. Cruz is quick to respond with any questions or concerns.,location
"Had a great time.  The place was very clean.  The location was great, able to walk everywhere.",clean
Charming and quaint location. Right next to water. You will fall asleep listening to waves crashing all night long.,location
"Second time staying here - feels like a home away from home. Just love it - amazing view, steps down to the beach. we loved having the fire going in the evening this time. So cute & cosy. Impossible not to relax here. Nothing beats staying right over the water ðð¼",location
"This place was INCREDIBLE! It sits right on top of the water, is decorated adorably, and you have incredibly easy access to the private beach! Easy to find, right in the heart of Malibu! 10/10 would reccomend!",location
Cruzâs place was a dream stay in Malibu. Walking distance to the pier and some of the best sunset views in  the area.,location
It was just soo relaxing & such a beautiful view. Totally recommend it for a small get away!,location
Great place! View is breathtaking & very calming! Itâs a perfect weekend getaway.,location
"Walls are little thin, so you can hear everything your neighbors are doing, HOWEVER the sounds of the ocean make up for that.  This beach condo can't be beat with location and views! Very clean and welcoming.  Owner does a great job communicating quickly to answer questions.",location
"the location is great however this is a very under maintained property.  the host was unresponsive to issues we spent our first night without working shower, the tv did not operate nor did pull out bed and the place smells.",clean
"We were looking for an apartment on the beach to get away for a few nights, and this place was absolutely fabulous. The location was unbeatable and getting to the beach took literally a minute. It was also really close to a lot of food options which was great for our stay.<br/><br/>The apartment itself was very clean and inviting, albeit a bit tinier than expected. This wasnât an issue for us and we definitely enjoyed our stay!<br/><br/>Added plus that there is a parking space available, so we never had to worry about finding parking.<br/><br/>Would stay again!",clean
"Super easy finding parking. Overall great, peaceful stay. Close to shops and food. Great shower, kitchen, bed was very comfortable too!",location
Always an amazing visit. We come back once or twice a year. The management team is especially helpful as well.,location
This site is right above the sandy beach providing the BEST OCEAN-VIEW!,location
Worth every penny,clean
The location is unique and beautiful. A great place for a weekend stay even if you live local as itâs a one-of-a-kind beach and experience. Condo is clean and had everything you need. We loved the fireplace and kitchen is well-stocked.,location
"This place is much smaller than it looks in the photos. It is hard to find (there was no address on the building, which was boarded up in COVID when we arrived) and the instructions for check-in weren't clear. The host had to let us into the building via the intercom, but he didn't answer our first several attempts on the intercom or calling him on the phone. We stood outside in the cold dark with our luggage for a while, getting rather frustrated. Additionally, it wasn't clear that the parking was several blocks away. I had a sprained ankle and wasn't expecting to have to walk that far, but fortunately I found and rented a bird scooter nearby. We left a night early and stayed with a friend because this spot just wasn't worth it. I feel like we would have had better service and experience with similar location if we just chose one of the hotels nearby.",location
Gorgeous location. Very clean and private. I loved my stay and will be back soon!,clean
"We absolutely loved this stay, the view every morning was a dream and Cruz was so patient with all our questions. I will most definitely be back!",location
The place was great! Saw dolphins and seals everyday from the deck. Perfect location.,location
"I booked this listing as a surprise for my wife for our 10 year wedding anniversary.  <br/><br/>First, the directions on the location, parking, entry to the unit, garbage and access to the beach were very helpful and accurate.  <br/><br/>Second, one of the most important things for me is cleanliness and freshness.   The place was very clean; the furniture well maintained; the sheets, towels and sofa all clean.  <br/><br/>Third, the place was well equipped with nice plates, utensils, wine glasses, bottle opener, kettle, microwave and a good refrigerator and freezer. <br/><br/>Fourth, this was one of the most amazing locations given access to the beach and given proximity to Ralphâs, Whole Foods, Starbucks, Nobu, etc.   <br/><br/>Fifth, we have stayed in a lot of âexpensiveâ places with a âview of the oceanâ.  This was unlike anything we have ever experienced.   As soon as you walk into the living room, it feels like the ocean is right in front of you.  It is awesome to hear the waves all the time.  To feel the sand.  To see dolphins regularly.  The sunset, sunrise and moon are awesome from the terrace which is right above the ocean.  <br/><br/>One of the most amazing anniversaries we have ever had.",clean
"Beautiful view on the top floor with access to the private beach is outstanding. Comfortable for two people to relax. It is an older building, but the condo itself is updated. We bought groceries and cooked for ourselves which I would recommend.",location
"My husband and I stayed in Suite 3 and we were blown away. The view from our private balcony was even better than we expected! Cruz was responsive when we checked-in, and we have no complaints. It was the best getaway and we wouldn't change a thing about it!",location
"This place is great! Amazing location walking distance to lots of places. Super cute, super clean smelled something I canât describe is a old remodeled place besides the bathroom and the deck the place is fresh updated but Iâm not sure if the smell was the sea air or the old construction but a scented candle fixed just fine, nothing major. Really appreciate the cleanness even the sofa covers seemed fresh washed. Lots of towel bed beautiful made. Love the extra touches such as bottles of water, coffee and cream even make up remover! Was so nice to hang at the deck sipping wine with the sound of the ocean. Kitchen is fully equipped. Sonos music system no tv Chanelâs but Apple TV and other apps. I used YouTube. Love walking on the beach, perfect view to sunrise from the deck  but not to sunset at this time of the year (January) but walking distance to where you can watch perfect! <br/>Overall I love the experience! The price is great I will book again for sure!",clean
"Beautiful views, clean spacious home, close to everything we needed. Great staycation for me and my girls.  My daughter enjoyed her bday here canât wait to return.  The sound of the waves at night and the views during the day were breathtaking.  The host was very nice, communicative and even allowed us to stay on the property to enjoy the beach after check out.  Would definitely recommend this place.",location
Beautiful unit enjoyed every second of it will definitely return.,clean
Could not be closer to the ocean. Fall asleep to the sound of the waves. : ),location
"This is a charming, clean and nicely decorated place RIGHT on the ocean. Couldn't ask for a better location.",location
"Super cozy and sweet.  Brought my girls here for their birthday.  Great size place for four and nice beach below for making sand castles!!  We saw dolphins and all kinds of great ocean gliders!  Easy parking, great neighbors, awesome!",location
The views from the private balcony can not get better. Location is amazing and the house is clean and well taken care of. This is a must stay location.,location
It was perfect getaway ! I would definitely stay here again .,location
The place was a bit more run down than expected. But great location and overall good stay.,location
"This is our second time staying here. We love it and all its charm. The bathroom is a bit outdated but it is a small bungalow on the beach after all ;) Highly recommend, the TV is fantastic, the view is unmatched and it's so peaceful. The neighbors are very respectful of each other.",location
"Ryan's place is very comfortable and clean. It has everything you need to feel relaxed and refresh. <br/>You'll love the peace, quiet, and cozy charm that Topanga has to offer.",clean
"Ryanâs place was everything we wanted and more. It was cute, clean, and spacious! We would definitely recommend his place to our friends. We also loved the ride up there!",clean
"Amazing place. Cute, fun, local to everything, great neighbors.",location
"This place is in a cool location up a winding road and is very quiet. The organization makes it seem spacious even for such a small space. There were enough dishes to cook a simple meal (one burner only on the hot-plate stove, no oven, and also a microwave). <br/>The table was set with plates, etc., ready for a meal. Everything was sparkling clean.",clean
"The lovely room fully met expectations and was a perfect location for visiting Malibu, Santa Monica and Calabasas to the north. Great to be slightly out of the noise with easy access to all the highlights. Highly recommend!",location
Had a phenomenal stay! Excellent service. The home is stunning...thereâs no getting around it.,location
Great space in a great location. The patio and view are incredible. The place was sparkling clean. Host was quick to respond when I had questions.,location
I have stayed at Kelley's place a few times and she is definitely a winner host.  We had a not so pleasant experience at another location and she made up for it by being so easy to work with and for having a stellar location.  I consider her place a home away from home and can't wait to come back to my little slice of heaven.,host
Cruzâs responsiveness and hospitality are above and beyond! Outstanding location and views. You will not be disappointed!,location
"My wife and I had a great time at the Malibu Suites. The view from the balcony is great! Nice, cozy suite with access to the beach. The fire pit itâs a great feature. The host was great communicating all instructions, tips, etc. Very organized/detail set up and the parking lot itâs just few steps away from the stairs that connects you to the suite. We had a very nice time at the Malibu Suites. Recommended.",location
Great location and exactly what you expect! We had an amazing stay!,location
The Malibu Suites never disappoint. Always so clean and cozy. My favorite place to be. Been 3 times and will be coming back forever.,clean
"If you need a quiet and zen weekend, this is the perfect location for you. The natural sounds of waves and dolphin sightings were my most favorite! This place wonât let you down. I plan to come back soon!",location
"We loved this place! I knew the location from having previously stayed at another unit in the complex, so I knew it was right where I wanted to be for a brief staycation. The one full day we spent here was beautiful (sunny and warm), so, despite our intention to go hiking in the area, we were so happy in the unit, with the sound of the ocean and the ocean breeze blowing through, we stayed here almost all day. It's cheerful and super clean, and the bed is comfy.",clean
"Great space right off the water, and was good for our family of 3. I would not recommend having more than 3-4ppl stay in this small space. Place was clean and accurate to what was described on the listing. Waves crashing are loud but totally bearable and building felt sturdy. Bathtub could use an upgrade as paint and caulked surfaces were chipped/chipping. There were some loose floorboards that were dangerous for us and especially our 22 month old so we had to place furniture over it to ensure feet werenât hurt. Would hope they fix that immediately to avoid accidents. Very close to restaurants, retail and the pier which made it easy to explore Malibu whether on foot or short trip in the car. Host couldâve sent the door access code well in advance, as we were messaging 20 minutes prior to our arrival to request the info. Luckily we received it just 5 minutes prior to arrival. We would stay here again.",clean
Really fantastic cute little spot right over the ocean. Location really doesn't get much better than that.,location
Literally right on the shore. Quaint and cozy! Had no issues!,location
Great spot to enjoy the beach,location
Ryanâs place was absolutely wonderful with amazing scenic views. 10/10 will definitely stay again!,location
"Quiet apartment nestled in the mountains above Topanga. Ryan did an excellent job of offering tips on what to do and where to go in town, which was much lovelier than I expected. Very clean and the decorations were sweet, personal touches. Would definitely recommend.",clean
The location and views were perfect. Perfect for a single or couple.,location
Ryanâs place was a great space for us and had everything we needed on our quick trip to Topanga. Detailed directions given and the communication was great! Would definitely return!,location
"We stayed in the clean and lovely Apartment for 4 days and had a pretty good time! Apartment with everything you need and more, near to bars and supermarket....all that can be desired! If you would like to visit Los Angeles, Santa Monica and so on it is a perfect Apartment. Communication was perfect and we got lots of helpful hints! Ryan was a nice host. Highly recommended! :)",clean
"This studio space is perfect for a coupleâs weekend getaway. Tucked away off a winding canyon road, this stylish guest room has the conveniences of home including a kitchenette with a mini-fridge and portable induction cook plate for meal prep. Thereâs also an outdoor seating area where we enjoyed a drink and a bit of reading time. <br/>Light sleepers may find themselves up early as the unit is in the lower level of the familyâs home. But we are early risers and enjoyed getting an early start to our daysâ activities. <br/>Ryan and his wife couldnât have been nicer or more accommodating. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!",location
Amazing location. Studio apartment. The view is incredible. Love the host Kelley is great.,location
"Perfect location, if you stay in the area, thereâs no need for a rental car. Such friendly neighbors. Would absolutely stay here again.",location
Ryanâs place was very clean and had a lot of amenities. Driving to and from the home was the only con because the roads leading up to the home are winding and narrow. Other then that our overall experience was great. Ryan was great host and very hospitable. We would gladly stay there again.,clean
"Ryan's place is a gem!! Beautiful location, excellent hospitality !!",location
"Excellent place! Would recommend to anyone wishing to travel to this area. Ryan was an outstanding host, 10 out of 10!",location
Stunning views from the balcony make it worth every penny!,location
"Absolutely beautiful place to spend a weekend. Easy to check in and check out, a nice, clean space, and it's honestly pretty surreal sitting on a balcony and looking directly down at the water!",location
What a fantastic location with the waves breaking right under the house.  Awesome patio even has a view of the Malibu Pier. Cozy fireplace. Totally private even though others are around. Nicely done for sure,location
"Magical Oceanfront location made this trip one to remember. I spent five days here and celebrated Motherâs Day with my two grown children.The location is private, quiet and just magical.Although itâs only steps from Nobu, the area was quiet and serene. Cruz was a wonderful host, responded right away and was very accommodating. I enjoyed both Bungalow 3 and Bungalow 12, both are exception.The sofa bed was comfortable as was the bedroom. We enjoyed watching dolphins up close while sitting on our deck. Thank you Cruz for being such a great host.",location
Right on the water with the waves crashing below you into the building. Its amazing! we loved our stay,location
Definitely a great place for a couples getaway. The place itself is a cute little place with an amazing view. Loved waking up to an ocean view and the sounds of waves crashing. Itâs conveniently located and walking distance from Malibu Pier and Nobu. The hosts were very responsive and accommodating to our needs. Would definitely recommend this place to others!,location
"Great location and well appointed bungalow. The tides did cover up this part of the beach during most of our stay so we had to go elsewhere to enjoy the beach. Otherwise, everything was great!",location
This place provided the ultimate beachfront experience! You're incredibly close to the water & in walking distance to the Pier.,location
"Amazing location right over the water with easy access to the beach. Beach in front of house is too narrow to lie on but great balcony to relax on and quick walk up or down the beach to other areas to relax. Given the cost, I found the bathroom in need of an update. Book for nearby restaurants well in advance-I couldnât get us a reservation at Nobu during our stay.",location
Fantastic. I would give this Air BnB 10 stars instead of 5 if I could. You can walk to the pier or a few restaurants and you can see the ocean from everywhere but the bathroom. The view was beautiful and it was so nice to relax on the patio (even with June Gloom in Malibu!),location
Great location and view.  Would stay here again.,location
We loved the high tide waves crashing under the building.,location
"We loved relaxing to the sounds of the ocean, feeling the cool breeze from the deck and even inside the condo, walking or running on the beach at low tide and playing in the surf at high tide.   The only way to get more on the water would be in a boat. Great dry sandy beaches close by as well.   Great restaurants close by.  Our host was very responsive to text messaging.  Couldnât have been a better stay.",location
"This is a beautiful spot, right on the beach. 10/10 recommend. The house description is exactly as advertised.",location
"I would give this place a 3.5 star, and the reasons are these:<br/>1. I paid $2000 plus for a 2 day stay, with taxes, that influences lot of my reviews.<br/>2. The view in breath taking no doubt.<br/>3. But the house keeping is not.<br/>4. They are very responsive clean and all those that you expect from a good host.<br/>5. But for a 1000$ per night, I would expect better stuffed kitchen with basics like coffee tea milk and sugar. Not left overs. I would expect better supply of beddings for sofa bed. Better sofa bed. May be a DWR brand. May be a washer dryer.<br/>6. All my reviews are influenced by the high prices and almost below average house keeping. I have stayed in better air b and b s with much better supplies and 1/4 the cost, in big expensive cities. Whether the high rate justifies just the view, I think overpriced and underserved.",clean
My happy place!!,clean
great spot and location. views and sounds of the ocean will melt all your troubles away and put you in the vacation spirit.  Not to mention its really close to some good breakfast and dining spots.,location
This bungalow was a lovely mid-week getaway for locals who want a sample of beachfront Malibu living. We had everything we needed in terms of the kitchen and bathroom. There were plenty of incredible restaurants nearby and the deck was the perfect place to relax on Carbon Beach. The living area also had ample space to tuck in and watch a movie at night--we can't wait to return!,location
Location excellent. Beautiful being right on the beach.,location
"Simple, clean apartment in an ideal location.  We spent our visit on the private deck directly over the Pacific Ocean. It was delightful.  We should note, however, that there was very little water pressure in the shower and we would have been very uncomfortable had the weather been warmer. The air-conditioners were extremely loud and ineffective and the only window that opens is the deck door.",clean
Spectacular view!!! Charming and quaint Beach Bungalow. We had a wonderful stay!,location
The view was incredible,location
"Wonderful, clean apartment on the ocean. Hosts are super nice and very responsive. We were able to check in and relax in record time!",clean
Great place to stay! Clean with a beautiful view of the ocean. We would definitely stay there again,location
"I had envisioned how I wanted to spend my birthday and this beautiful beach home was everything I wanted and more. I would recommend this spot to anyone, Iâm a frequent traveler and this is by far one of the best Airbnbâs Iv gotten for peace and relaxation. It gives new meaning to âwhite noiseâ. I donât have a single complaint. <br/><br/>On top of such a glorious experience, I accidentally left my late grandmotherâs necklace. Cruz was able to locate it and mail it back to me.  It made my heart smile. Will be returning â¥ï¸â¨",location
"Very cute, cozy, clean place in a terrific location! Just a couple blocks to a downtown, a bay with kayak rentals and swimming, and the beach! AND you CANNOT beat the view! Kelley was helpful, warm and quick to respond. Checking in/out was easy, and we appreciated the amenities. We loved the place and sure you will too!",location
Kelley was a great host. She was very responsive to all my questions. The place is great. You cannot beat the location. Walking distance to everything. Thank you so much for having us!,location
Kelleyâs spot was unbelievable!! Cross the street and youâre on the beach. We had an awesome stay! Great view from the balcony unit #C,location
I would absolutely stay here again! The atmosphere was so relaxing and the sound of the waves put me to sleep. Perfect location and very walkable. Beach access is so convenient even though the tide gets high so sometimes you canât walk right onto the sand.,location
Exceeded my expectations.. you canât beat that view! I fell in love with this place. Very clean and host was very responsive. Will definitely stay here again.,location
"Perfect spot for a couple's staycation! Only a few minutes walk to the Malibu Pier and right next to Nobu. Oh and of course, the beach is just a short walk down a staircase! We enjoyed many nights sitting on the balcony or by the fireplace, listening to the waves. Cruz was very kind and responsive to my questions. Would definitely stay again!",location
"The place was a great location. The most relaxing place that I have stayed the ocean view was amazing! The bed was extremely comfortable, the water pressure was not the strongest but overall I give it 5 stars!!!",location
Great location! The ocean views were stunning.,location
"I can't express enough how much I enjoyed staying in this unit!  Besides the absolutely jaw dropping view, the experience with Cruz made things even more enjoyable.  There was prompt response to all of my questions, the instructions in the email were crystal clear, and the overall attitude was just great.  The unit was spotless, the bed comfortable, the kitchen fully stocked, and ambience just oozed charm.  <br/><br/>While Nobu is just a very short walk from the unit, I suggest that guests explore the restaurant at the Malibu Inn, which is just a short walk going the other way.  They have a beautiful outdoor patio that is right over the ocean.   I believe the restaurant is called the Carbon Beach Club.  Reservations are pretty much required.",clean
Ryan was very helpful... The place is really beautiful. It is a remote place so you have to take some considerations if you want to go out,location
"Amazing hide out, perfect for anyone wanting a retreat out of town!",location
"Ryanâs place was the perfect getaway. Communication with Ryan was a breeze, and he made the entire process incredibly simple. The location was amazing- we enjoyed being tucked away in the mountains with easy access to some great hiking and food options. Highly recommend!",location
"Great place to stay, great location. Ryan was particularly helpful when we had a problem.",location
"Awesome little place, weâd love to come back. It was very cool exploring the town of Topanaga, weâd recommend Mimosa Cafe for a cup of coffee or bite to eat. The space was everything we could ask for. Well decorated, clean, with any little amenity that may be useful.",clean
"Ryanâs place is in a great location to explore the area - not far from LA or Malibu or up into the hills. Topanga has lots of places to eat for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The bed is very comfy and the check in process was a breeze. Highly recommended.",location
Had a great stay here. Everything was as described and close to everything I wanted to do in the area. It was a little difficult to find especially in the dark due to a narrow road and not a lot of lights but I got directions from Ryan before arriving and they helped a lot. I would definitely stay here again if ever in the area,location
Nice apartment located in the mountain. We would come back again.,location
Great getaway in the mountains! Close to the state park and Malibu. Very clean! Ryan made us feel right at home.,clean
Ryan was a wonderful host! Communication was easy and the extra directions sent before check in were incredibly helpful. Everything was as described and is the perfect spot for quiet but close enough to the city.,location
"We enjoyed our stay at Ryan's place! The space was very clean and he had everything we needed. Check-in was simple, and Ryan was available to provide suggestions when we had questions about the area, which was much appreciated! The listing does recommend having your own car,  and we found out why real quick - the house is very high up in the middle of the mountains, which made getting around a bit tough without a car. Ultimately, we didn't have any real trouble with Uber, but we did have a few drivers cancel on us, and the ones that did pick us up took around 20 minutes to get to the house. There is also a confusing turn close to the house, and just about all of our Uber drivers went the wrong way, which added even more waiting time. We also didn't have cell service in that area (AT&T/T-Mobile), so we had to use the WiFi as a workaround. Just a couple things to keep in mind, but overall, this is a great place to stay, the area is beautiful, and Ryan is a wonderful host!",clean
"Ryan's place was beautiful, nestled in a crazy hill/mountain.  We loved this place and the streets surrounding it.  Ryan was super nice and very helpful.  We would definitely stay here again.",location
Really awesome place to stay!,location
"This was a bright, stylish open space tucked in the mountains with everything you need for a comfortable stay. Ryan was a hospitable and kind host, and easy to communicate with.  He gave good instruction to find his place. We enjoyed our stay!",location
"Ryanâs place is really great! Located not far from Los Angeles and surrounded by the beautiful hills. The suite is very comfy and the check in was hassle free. Ryan was an outstanding host, highly recommended!",location
"Ryan's place is simple, sufficient and very elegant. It was very clean, the location of the house is amazing. Ryan had provided us with accurate directions before the trip which helped us as we lost cellular connectivity in the area. I'll surely recommend staying at Ryan's place.",clean
"This is a great little apartment! Very clean, comfortable, beautiful location.",clean
"Great spot, very quiet up in the Canyon. Ryans studio is very clean and very comfortable. It was a great base to come home too after a busy few days down on the coast.",location
Ryanâs place is surrounded by beautiful nature. Itâs quiet and it has everything you need for travelling the area. We discovered LA from both directions (the valley/universal studios and Santa Monica/Beach etc.) through the canyon and didnât have much traffic. <br/>The studio was clean and we had a parking lot on their property. Ryan and his wife were great host. <br/>Would gladly come back!,location
"Super cute suite nestled in the topanga hills about 45 min outside of DTLA. Ryanâs family lives on the property but they give you plenty of space and privacy you forget theyâre even around. Worked out for me traveling alone, I felt safe having someone close. 5 stars for Ryan heâs a very friendly and thoughtful host. The neighborhood is absolutely gorgeous. You have a Mountain View from the suite. I definitely would love to come again.",location
Ryanâs place was great for a weekend getaway! Awesome location and super quiet and peaceful!,location
"Ryan is super cool and his place is the perfect little get away from the city. It's close to a multitude of beaches and restaurants, and the view is beautiful. The place is clean, and styled beautifully. I loved his art work.",location
"Ryan's apartment is very clean, private and comfortable.  Thoughtful touches all around, coffee, great shower, comfy bed and AC.  Ryan was always super quick to respond to my texts and always very helpful.  His place is in a quiet neighborhood tucked deep into a canyon road, but only a short drive to the beach.  It's an ideal place for a solo traveler or a couple.  The only hesitation one might have is if you're not comfortable driving around on a narrow, winding canyon road (it's paved).  But everyone on the road is cautious and there are mirrors at every blind turn.  This wasn't a problem for me.  I give this place an A+ and would stay here again in a heartbeat.",clean
My boyfriend and I staked at Kellyâs place for our anniversary weekend and had a blast! You are walking distance to  kayaking and paddle boarding and just a short bike ride away from some awesome breweries. Kelly was quick to respond to me when I needed help with parking and her instructions helped us enjoy our stay even more! Thank you!,location
Amazing place! Loved our visit. Easy to find and parking was right out front. Ryan was amazing. Would love to book here again,location
"If your stuck between going on hiking trails and enjoying some sunshine at the beach why not do both and stay at Ryans place offering a great location for all those activities. Very welcoming and easy to reach wonât regret booking. The suite is nicely set up, clean, and relaxing making it the perfect getaway spot.",location
"One of the nicest places in Topanga. It was a perfect location for wanting to travel to both Malibu and Santa Monica. For me, I didnât get service but there is WiFi to stay connected. It was quiet and peaceful as well. The place is a cozy studio and the bathroom was very clean as well. I definitely would want to spend another weekend there. Ryan was also very chill and there were no issues with the host. He is considerate and respectful in making sure you have a private and enjoyable stay.",location
"PERFECT location!  Walking distance to many eating establishments. Vs across the street is fabulous!  No by just a short distance too. We tried for breakfast on the pier but there was a wreck on the freeway and workers werenât able to make it in to Malibu until later. Be flexible for things like this. We had very fast responses from Cruz and was very accommodating during our stay!  Be mindful it is tough to get an Uber after about 7-8 pm and there NO taxis in Malibu. During the day was no problem. The unit couldnât be more peaceful, watching the waves roll in right under your deck. <3. It is a tad bit in need of updating but is absolutely worth returning.",location
Great location! Great communication! This was a great stay! Would definitely stay again,location
"Amazing oceanfront condo and location. Walking distance to a nice surf shop and two amazing restaurants (Nobu and Vâs) with a short .8 mile drive to a beautiful downtown area with Whole Foods, nice restaurants, shopping and a Blue Bottle which is amazing coffee.<br/><br/>The condo is perfect and hidden away from the main road which feels more private. Waves feel like they are crashing right under the condo which is how close they are and beach access is steps away. <br/><br/>All rooms were perfectly clean and everything we needed was present.<br/><br/>This was the perfect getaway for my wife and I along with our 2.5 month old who loved looking at to the ocean and hearing the waves.",location
"Absolutely beautiful unit, location and views, our family had a wonderful time and look forward to visiting again soonâ¥ï¸",location
Could not get a more beautiful location. I would HIGHLY recommend to anyone who dreams of falling asleep to the sounds of ocean waves crashing below you!,location
"You can'task for a better location, nestled between the Pier and Nobu. The views are stunning and Cruz is extremely responsive to any questions. Hope to return to this gem of a place.",location
The location is the best and the place is super clean. Everything is provided and house manual is clear and specific so checkin is very easy.,clean
"A true sanctuary by the ocean! So healing to hear and feel the waves crash right outside. If u are not a morning person, it will inspire you to wake up early to watch the magical sunrises. This is truly one of the best experiences we have had thru Airbnb",location
"Absolutely perfect. You are right on the ocean, everything you need is there. The sunsets are amazing. Communication and check in were fantastic, easy absolutely no issues. Will be back as soon as I can. Thank you for a perfect moment away from everything.",location
Excellent place to stay in Malibu. Will definitely come back.,location
Amazing location and a beautiful view. Just a short walk to the pier and the private balcony made it so worth it. Thanks again!,location
we enjoyed our time <br/>prime location,location
Loved this condo. It was right on the beach . The interior was really nice and the deck on the beach was even nicer. The location is right next to Nobu which is my favorite Japanese restaurant in LA. 5 stars!,location
Love being right on the beach!,location
A wonderful place for a relaxing beach getaway!,location
"Suite 3 is fantastic! It is in the perfect location and right on the beach. Falling asleep to the sounds of the waves crashing beneath you is amazing. Even during the middle of winter we were able to sit on the balcony, enjoy the sun and amazing views. . At night the fireplace kept us warm and enhanced our romantic stay for two. The place is centrally located where you can walk to amazing restaurants and enjoy views from the Malibu pier. The place itself could use a little updating, but overall is a great place to stay. Cruz was awesome with communication and helped make our stay feel that much more comfortable - thanks Cruz!",location
Relaxing,location
Fantastic ! Awesome place with a beautiful view!,location
Amazing stay. Great communication.,location
"Our stay at the Malibu Suites was lovely - beautiful location right on the ocean, so relaxing a perfect weekend getaway. <br/>Cruz is a fantastic host - great communication. We are ready to go back!",location
Everything was perfect! Every little detail has been thought through. The most romantic stay in LA. You can't beat this location. Will definitely come back.,location
"Loved our stay at The Malibu Suites! Beautiful view, amazing location and the check in/checkout processes were very seamless.",location
Great little spot for a nice getaway to the beach. Thanks!,location
"Ryan has a slice of heaven in Topanga! The location was perfect and super close to everything. Easy to find, and directions beforehand from host were extremely helpful. I enjoyed getting to hike & explore Topanga State Park, as well as several great spots along the PCH. Dinner at Gladstoneâs, was delicious with a beautiful view. I also had the pleasure of enjoying coffee and breakfast at Cafe On 27 (Highly Recommend!) <br/><br/>The suite was so comfortable, and a great spot to relax after adventuring. 10/10! The size of the space is PERFECT, clean, and makes you feel right at ease.<br/>I am already looking forward to booking again!! Thank you Ryan!!!",location
"Ryan's place was a perfect retreat from the noise and commotion of the city. It was very clean and well appointed, located just a short walk from some breathtaking views of the canyon. I spent most of my trip sitting outside reading and walking around the neighborhood, but he's only a short drive from the restaurants and cafes in Topanga, and just a bit further down the coast to get to Malibu. I look forward to coming back the next time I need a weekend of rest and relaxation!",location
The ride up the mountain where Ryanâs room is located is very narrow and is a two way street with only one lane. The place was clean and comfortable. Shower is hot and everything works great. Only tip is be careful on some of those sharp turns.,clean
Ryan is a warm & kind host and the venue is lovely. Topanga has character and history!,location
such a great stay and very close to the beach and central area. clean and cute,location
Ryan is a great host! He was quick to respond and very friendly. His cozy suite was cute and clean making our stay in Topanga very enjoyable.,clean
"The location can not be beat! Beautiful view with a great little patio for grilling, enjoying your coffee or a drink. The bed was very comfortable and Kelley was helpful and very responsive. I would definitely go back for another stay!",location
Great location.,location
A wonderful location and quick access to 2nd street and the ocean,location
2nd time that I booked Kelleyâs place. <br/>Everything was wonderful. Love the place and the location right by the beach. Did some exploring around the area and everything is within walking distance. Definitely will be book Kelleyâs place again.,location
Perfect little spot to experience SoCal living in.,location
Great stay! Great view! Fun sand toys. Nice TV. Big shower! Right across the street from beach steps. Street parking was easier than expected.,location
"Great place to stay, great view.",location
Perfect location and the Murphy bed was very comfortable. That was the only thing i was worried about when i booked but it wasnât a problem at all. Beautiful views.,location
"Perfect location, clean, and friendly host.  I would highly recommend.",clean
"The location of this airbnb is second to none. It's right on a swimming beach, a block and a half from the ocean and a block the other direction from the main drag of Belmont shores with tons of dining and shopping options. I'd never visited this area before but quickly realized what a gem this apartment is. Kelley was so helpful with anything we needed. We spent 9 nights here on vacation and loved every minute of it.",location
Great little place!,location
"Quaint little beach studio, with a great view of the Bay right in front of you. Location couldn't have been better with dining and shops less than a 5 minute walk to 2nd st and the beach less than 5 min walk the other direction. The studio apt balcony is a great place to relax with the view and to people watch. Look forward to coming back soon...",location
"The location is amazing, located right above Malibu in the quaint Topanga area. Yet what made this place stand out the most is Ryan and his helpfulness and kindness. He gives great tips, is generous and is very down to earth and has some cool stories to tell. Five stars, will be back soon!",location
The place was secluded but close to all the local sights. Ryan has the place clean. Definitely recommend arriving before sun down your first night.,location
Incredible location. Had a great stay.,location
"The location was ideal. Just steps to the sand and an easy walk to the pier. We had a great time just sitting on the balcony and watching the birds and occasional seal and dolphins. The walls are pretty thin, so you can hear the neighbors, but it wasn't too disturbing. Just listen to the sound of the ocean waves. Cruz, the manager, was very helpful and accommodating.",location
This location is heaven. Literally on the beach and clean. Host is communicative and accommodating. I love my stay!,clean
Perfect spot right on the ocean - Iâm already excited to rent this place again. Thank you!,location
Excellent place !!<br/>amazing views  right in front of the ocean<br/>Would love to come back <br/>Fantastic service.,location
"This place is spectacular! If you are looking to stay on Carbon beach in Malibu, I would def recommend this beautiful little bungalow. It's really cozy, clean and well set up for a wonderful time at the beach and in the city. We loved the attached sunning deck, white couch, fully stocked kitchen and very comfortable bed. We could def hear the waves at night, so if that's not your thing, choose one a bit further from the ocean:) Hope to see you next year!",location
"Great place to stay! Great views right on the beach. Walking distance to the pier and restaurants. Highly recommend this place, even with kiddos!",location
"Great location, access to beach, and views! You can easily enjoy a weekend here without driving anywhere. The cleanliness can be improved, we found sand in the sheets when sleeping and started to doubt if the sheets were actually cleaned or not. The place is also had a broken window in the front that did not shut. We asked for it to be fixed, responded right away but was not able to fix the window and tried their best by stuffing the gap with towels. Another issue with this place is the temperature control. It only working unit is in the front living room space, so the bedroom stays cold most of the night unless you blast the heater making the front living room a furnace. We had our new born babies with us and it was quite difficult to make sure they were warm enough, because of the window but also didn't want them to be excessively hot, we being in the bedroom decided to just bundle up. Thankfully we had our own heavy blanket in the car that we used. The place is great for location and views but not as comfortable as you would imagine it to be.",location
"A wonderful stay! We will be back for sure. It was perfect, location, clean, all the necessities, communication etc!",clean
this is heaven. Your own little joint at the beach.  all went smooth. will come again,clean
ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!!!! Location is amazing. Right on the beach with private beach access. Couldnât have asked for a better stay - this property was the highlight of my entire stay. THANK YOU!!,location
Gem of a property & location in Malibu. As seamless Airbnb experience you can hope for. Property is as advertised and more..!Highly recommended for vacation or business trip.,location
"Everything was perfect! Super clean and peaceful, woke up to waves and dolphins every morning. Incredible location too! Recommend this stay to everyone!",clean
Gorgeous location and very convenient. We were able to walk to restaurants every night. The kitchen has everything you need. Beautiful view from the deck with a visit by dolphins everyday.,location
"This property is truly amazing, the ocean, dolphins, quality linens , fireplace <br/>itâs heaven",location
"This location is perfect for a cozy, beautiful beach stay! We enjoyed our time and convenience of this location!",location
"It is a beautiful location and such a fun environment to be in. Gorgeous ocean views having nothing but that in front of you and a hop and a skip to one of my favorite places,  Nobu. The fireplace is an added bonus. A very cool place to celebrate a friend ð¥ðð",location
Beautiful spot on the beach. Great manager.,location
"Beautiful, clean, calm place with an incredible energy.  We will definitely be back!",clean
Ryanâs place is a gem! Chicly decorated with beautiful scenery of Topanga. Ryan kindly let us park in his driveway. We were only a 20 minute drive from our activities in Malibu. Would definitely stay there again!,location
The apartment is a cute little studio with what you need for two people.  Murphy bed was surprisingly comfortable and the shower was huge!<br/><br/>The location is amazing and the main perk... (my favorite) Waterfront view of bay from balcony!  Lots of activities in walking distance. From the front of the home you can turn right and strollto the beach in five minutes. Go a couple blocks the other direction and you're on 2nd with lots of restaurants and stores!<br/><br/>Kelly communicated well from before check in and made getting in and out easy. Till next time!,location
Ryan was very accommodating and the space was very clean and nice to stay in for my weekend get away!,clean
"Awesome place up in the hills!<br/>Nice spot, very quiet, very clean. Ryan was a great host and was super helpful/responsive. Denitrify recommend for anyone wanting a nice Malibu/Topanga getaway",clean
"Great stay ! Ryan was really responsive & helped me out when the WiFi wasnât working perfectly he just reset it right away! And the highway up to the house was blocked and he gave me directions for the back way which was extremely helpful! Definitely felt very safe and easy parking for 1 car. Nice shower & comfortable space overall. No cell service up there which is so nice for a retreat type stay, but if you need to make lots of work calls good to keep in mind.",clean
"Amazing gem, clean and great location. Owner was super easy to contact and communicate with.",clean
"If you are looking for a location near downtown and the  Malibu pier this unit is it. The building is older and has its quirks. It isnât fancy so price might raise expectations but given its Malibu,  inflated value to price is something to keep in mind . I might say more like a 3 star hotel which isnât bad just not what we were expecting given the high price tag. The team there was nice and accommodating and if you are looking for somewhere to be on the water you will be ok.",location
Lovely beach front stay! Perfect Malibu getaway with walking distance to Nobu and Malibu farm.  Will definitely be back!,location
"You cannot find a more perfect location in Malibu. You have more than a 180Â° view of the ocean. The waves are literally crashing below the balcony of Suite number three. This location is walking distance to the pier, surf spots and many restaurants. If you are hoping to walk out of the building onto the sand, that might not happen depending on time of year. The stretch of sand is very narrow and during our entire stay, even at low tide, there was nowhere to stand on the sand because the water level was too high. We had walked past the pier to get to the beach. Another thing to note is that, while clean, this is a very old apartment building. If you are looking for luxury, this isnât your place. That being said we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",location
As always 5 star experience! If you havenât stayed here yet youâre missing out on an amazing experience.,location
"The home and location are absolutely beautiful. Literally on the water, with a front seat viewing of Pelicans and Dolphins feeding all day long was an experience I will never forget. I will definitely be back. :)",location
"I love the stay, great atmosphere! Fun and so much beach you wouldnât want to go home!!",location
Amazing view! The pull out couch was actually very comfortable. Was a great birthday trip for my wife.,location
Such a charming place.  The waves are really incredible. The location is fantastic.  So close to Santa Monica and 2 mins from the main Malibu village shopping and dining area.  <br/><br/>The gas fireplace was a wonderful touch every evening.  Flawless stay.  Would definitely return.,location
"Great location, unfortunately it was high tide and the beach access was nonexistent when we visited in late May. Perfect for a couples getaway - not family friendly!  In particular, the deck overlooking the ocean has a deck with low open railing bars that was beautiful to look at but felt unsafe especially after my toddler figured out how to unlock the sliding doors onto the deck.",location
Second time staying here perfect like always! Definitely recommend!,location
"Amazing location and views, the perfect Malibu rental. We walked to lunch and dinner, enjoyed wine on the porch, and fell asleep to tinge sounds of the waves. Weâll be back!",location
"I enjoyed the stay there. The pictures are accurate and the host is very communicative. However, one thing I didnât expect is that the waves from the shore were very loud even at night. So light sleepers might find it hard to fall asleep.",location
Excellent place. We really enjoyed the stay.,location
"Amazing 5 star experience, this place never disappoints! Canât wait till the next stay.",location
Cute little apartment with an amazing balcony. We even saw dolphins in the morning and evening.,location
Return visitors always happy to come back! Thank you for all the hospitality! Puneh,location
"The ocean view is insane! The apartment itself is definitely dated and the furniture seemed a little older in person than in the pics, but if you donât care about that then itâs perfect for you. Stairs are steep so be careful! Location was great! Outside furniture felt a little gross, but maybe thatâs because all the moisture from the beach. Iâm really glad I got this place at a discount since I booked a day or so before. Wouldnât have wanted to pay full price, but again the ocean view was amazing. Communication was great!",location
"I would stay here again in a heartbeat! ð itâs stunning, the views are incredible, and the space is so welcoming and convenient. Couldnât have had a better stay!",location
"Suite 3 is a top floor, ocean front unit in a multi unit building. Beautiful space, premier location. Host is responsive and helpful. Recommend!",location
Beautiful place and communication was great with host who responded quickly. The view was beautiful and loved access to the beach. I wish a little more couldâve been included for the price of the rental. Overall we had a great time,location
The Malibu Suites property is absolutely amazing - such an unbelievable view and location! Hosts were very responsive and nice throughout the stay! Would definitely stay here again if in Malibu,location
"Great location, well equipped and well taken care of. They throw in a coffee maker, beach towels, etc, so basically a turnkey for a great beach day and evening.",location
"Great trip in Malibu, right on the water!",location
"Awesome stay! This place is so versatile. The pictures are spot on. You get what you see. It is perfect cozy spot for any season. Come here to relax with ocean views and escape stress. Nights can be cool so it's not crazy to pack a warm outfit. The beach is accessible near the unit but if it's high tide, it's not the best idea. Don't worry though because a three minute walk gets you to a beach that allows for all kinds of water activities. A 10-15 minute walk has high end shopping, Whole Foods, and other local boutiques. Nobu is basically next door but requires you to call a month prior, at 10am for reservations. I recommend Nobu's Omakase experience and Brunch at Malibu Farm Pier Restaurant. For those not familiar with Southern California, Los Angeles is less than an hour drive away. Have a wonderful time, I did! Oh and Cruz the host is great too, very informative and prompt.",location
"Stunning. We loved our stay here, amazing view - perfect for just sitting and absorbing the relaxing location. The property is older than the pictures suggest so a few fixtures felt old, but the suite was clean and tastefully decorated.",location
Ryan's place was exactly like the pictures posted. Very stylish place with a calm vibe. The Airbnb had great amenities that made the experience much more enjoyable. Highly recommend!,location
Amazing stay in an awesome location. Perfectly in between Santa Monica and Malibu and had amazing views throughout. Ryan was a great host that had all lines of communication open at all times. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.,location
Expect to be well taken care of - you'll arrive at a clean and quiet place!,clean
Ryanâs place was very nice. Clean and spacious. Felt very safe in the area. Pretty private space with plenty of room for one or two people. Bed was also comfortable. Would definitely stay again,clean
"A great location! So close to everything! Fun to sit on the porch and people watch. Right across the street to be on a beach. End of the block lots of places to eat!<br/><br/>Good internet. Functional (small) kitchen. Could use a table & chairs for meals/computer. What a great shower!! Tiny studio apartment meeting all our needs. Parking was on the street, but we never had problems finding a spot close by.",location
"Quiet, clean, and well kept, with up to date interiors and furnishings",clean
"Interior pics exactly as seen and probably more spacious in real life, clean and comfortable. If you have no experience with CA canyon bungalow style communities just be aware itâs quite steep to navigate in the dark! But very peaceful. Thanks to Ryan the host",clean
"Staying in Zdenka's room was a great experience. The location of the apartment is fantastic, and it is very clean and modern. Right next to the apartment there is a very large roofdeck that is great for barbecueing. The place is also right near Abbott Kinney and less than a $5 Uber to Venice Pier. ",clean
"The view of this airbnb is unbeatable at the price! The price is super reasonable and you get what you pay for, plus a little more with that view. We spent 75% of the time on the balcony and the bed is surprisingly very comfortable. We slept very well! A little more attention could be spent on cleaning, there are dusty spots that are easily missed, but that may just be me being overly clean. However, you won't find many waterfront views with a balcony and great location at this price! We felt like locals walking up to second street and getting our morning coffee. Belmont shore is an incredible little community and this airbnb is a great place to stay!",view
Ryan was super helpful and made sure that we are comfy <br/>Highly recommend this place within twenty minutes away from all the attractions in LA,location
Great location! Easy access to the beach and 2nd St. Small space but you should be outside because itâs always sunny in California! Loved hanging on the balcony and drinking morning coffee and people watching.,location
"Would 100% recommend staying at Ryanâs place. The location was perfect - Topanga is so cute, quaint, and full of character, PLUS only a short drive to Malibu. Ryan left great directions and communicated well. The space had everything my boyfriend and I needed for a nice weekend away, plus some! Additionally, Ryan has styled the studio very well and utilized the space very smartly. Overall, fantastic stay and I will definitely be coming back.",location
Great place! Ryan was super helpful and the place was sparkling clean. Very peaceful location and calm space!,clean
Great place...great host,location
"Such a great host and very cute place.. perfect for two people. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because of the location, the road is so narrow and so darker night, quite frankly itâs a pretty scary drive. The place however is so cute and Ryan is such a great host, he went above and beyond to make sure everything was in order! If you donât mind the mountain roads youâre going to love it here.",location
"A perfect, cozy and roomy studio in a beautiful area in Topanga. 10 mins down to PCH. STAY HERE!!",location
"This stay went above and beyond what we expected!! The pictures donât do this stay justice. Stay was immaculate, welcoming and full of great amenities. 5/5 and canât wait to go back for another stay!!!!",clean
"This place was incredible, the pictures don't do it justice.  It was secluded and peaceful with sunlit rooms, exposed brick and beautiful wood floors. <br/>Zoe and Matilda were great, from the BBQ under the Orange tree in the front garden to the ridiculously comfortable beds, every little detail was thought out to make me feel at home.  They really went above and beyond to make my stay in LA a wonderful experience.      <br/>The neighborhood was safe and quiet and I found myself pretty centrally located; close to Hollywood and the beach.  <br/>Thank you Zoe and Matilda for everything, Ill be seeing you guys on my next trip to LA!   <br/> ",location
Amazing! Not only was the place well maintained and in a lovely area but the host went far beyond our expectations as far as accommodating us.  My husband and I were in town for business and because of our host and her daughter our shirt business trip turned into a quick get away from home.  We will definitely come back and highly recommend staying here. ,location
"Mathilda and her daughter Zoe were fantastic hosts. Zoe was really responsive and helpful and set us up with everything we needed. She was even kind enough to let us come check the place out the day before. The decor is beautiful, the rooms are comfortable and the fenced-in front yard is an added bonus. I would definitely book here again and would recommend it others. A real find in the Valley!",location
Truly an incredible property in a great neighborhood in Sherman Oaks!   The property was very comfortable and just as described!   Excellent hosts!   Highly recommend to anyone staying in the Sherman Oaks area!  Thank you again,location
About ten days before we were to check in Mathilda contacted us to tell us that the rental home we had reserved had suffered a plumbing problem requiring work that would make the home unusable during our visit. As an alternative she offered her own home nearby.<br/><br/>This worked out perfectly and saved us from trying to find a new place for four people (and room for a dinner for 8) on short notice. It was graduation weekend at UCLA and we needed a big place for family to join us for our daughter's big day.<br/><br/>Her home was beautiful and she was just wonderful. We didn't see the property we had rented but no matter as it all worked out great!,location
"Mathilda's home was amazing.  Beautifully decorated and homey.  She welcomed us when we arrived and showed us around.  This is a very quiet neighborhood with close proximity to Beverly Hills, Hollywood, Sunset Blvd.  Getty Museum and several other popular spots.  Would certainly stay again.",location
"Mathilda's posada was perfect - the house was simply amazing: beautifully and stylishly decorated, super-clean, stocked with tons of thoughtful amenities and just a really, really nice space to spend time. The location is fantastic - quiet, safe, a couple of minutes drive from great shops and restaurants on Ventura and no more than 30 minutes from pretty much everything you want to get to (beach, downtown, Hollywood).  Mathilda was a great host too - really welcoming and super-responsive, without watching over us at all. Highly recommended - a perfect AirBnB experience!!",clean
"We stayed at Mathilda'a house for two nights. The house is exactly the same as described. It's clean and comfort. We found out that Mathilda is an interior designer, so she pays a lot attention on every details of the house. We enjoyed the stay there very much and we will definitely go back again when we visit LA next time. ",clean
"LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION! Talk about prime real estate! This place is perfect for anyone looking to escape for a weekend, a whole week or even longer. Being steps away from the water, we loved sitting on the deck in the evening and soaking up all that Long Beach has to offer!  There was not anything we wished we had had while staying.  Kitchen was stocked with cooking supplies, everything was very clean, and we hope to be able to come back and rent again!",location
"This apartment is in an area that CAN NOT be beat! Across the street from the beach, next to 2nd St, walk to rent Kayaks or a Gondola - itâs perfect. You have everything you need in the apartment and the balcony and view are incredible. We will definitely be back!",location

3rd time renting from this location.<br/>Cannot beat the location. Awesome view from the balcony and the people around the area.,location

Great location and a great host.,location
Very nice house! Every detials make us feel warm and comfortable.,clean
"We loved our stay at Posada de Sherman Oaks, it was like a home from home for the few days of our stay. The attention to detail was brilliant and it is such a lovely home. Zoe, Mathilda's, was very helpful and was always at hand for our questions. If we are in LA again, we will definetly look up this listing again. Thanks again for everything.",location
"Mathildas place is just as described through photos on the listing. Great location, very clean place, wonderfully decorated and very comfortable. Great wifi connection, movie library and streaming tv services such as hulu, Netflix and roku all available. The full had every dish and pot you could think of. We especially loved all of the skylights throughout the house. Lots of fresh linens and comfortable and clean beds. Loved the nest thermostat too! The air conditioning was very efficient. Great location and quiet street, parking was ample and easy, just beware of the signs for street cleaning and school hours. Though we never met in person, the house was ready to go once we arrived. Excellent communication on Mathildas end, especially when we hit a snag in the listing a couple days before and she was more than accommodating about it. Would definitely recommend this place and would love to stay here again! ",clean

Great place! Everything was wonderful - better than the pictures! Would love to stay there again!,location
"My stay at Mathilda's was perfect in every way. The flat was exactly as described and as captured in the airbnb photos, and in some aspects it even exceeded my expectations. The place was well-appointed and spotlessly clean. The kitchen was well-stocked, the furniture comfortable, and the linens plush. The TV had numerous channels, the internet connection was fast and seamless, and the thermostat was Nest-programmed and a cinch to use. I could go on, but you get the idea. Best of all, though, she was always responsive by text, and was accommodating to all of my requests and questions. ",clean

We had a wonderful night's rest in her comfortable beds. Mathilda was very accommodating and responsive. Highly recommended! ,location
"Mathilda is an exceptional host with an absolutely lovely home. Beautifully designed, a quiet, comfortable oasis... We are visiting for work, but have felt like we've been at a spa! She greeted us upon arrival, has a beautiful and helpful house manual and was super responsive to any needs. I hope to stay here often! ",location
"The house is fabulous and the space inside is much bigger than I thought. Mathilda is a very kind person and reply to our message very quickly. <br/>There were some small insects in the house, but since it's summer time I think it's normal. <br/>Overall, me and my friend had a great time here.",clean

"This was the first real Airbnb experience for me and was very stressful all the while until we found Mathilda and her listing..... It was a sudden breathe of fresh air and better than anticipated. Our hotel was overbooked and we chose this method last moment and glad we did. Upon arrival Mathilda was still cleaning and tending to what was obvious her ""baby"".... you can tell she genuinely puts her heart and soul into making sure her guests are thoroughly impressed and comfortable. Our situation was not one of a pleasure visit but more of a rushed moment to find lodging during work/family events in the area so the only relaxing we got was returning at night late and enjoying the unit for a brief time but it was so perfect at those moments. We are looking forward to returning... There is not a single thing that could be improved upon.... anyone who thinks so, should truly consider what they have gotten for the price.... my 5 star hotel had less amenities. Great place.",clean
"Wonderful wonderful place.  We had no idea of what an awesome rental we had until we arrived.  We enjoyed the scenic switchback road that leads up to the house. The host couldn't have been more gracious and helpful in every single one of our needs.  We truly felt at home here.  Topanga is beautiful and an inviting, amazing community.  :-)",location
"Best example of ""location, location, location"" in the area! Beautiful day- and night-time views and an easy walk to any restaurant on 2nd street.",location
Lovely getaway in topanga and Wonderful host!!,location
"Ryan is an excellent host, very helpful and communicative! The space is stylish and in a beautiful location - very convenient for anyone looking to hike or enjoy an impressive view! Just the right amount of isolation for those looking for a getaway while still being able to access restaurants and shops.",location
Ryanâs place is nestled in a lovey location within topanga canyon. For those wanting a beautiful view and a great escape Ryanâs location is the place to be.,location
This was such a pleasant stay. Just as described. Mathilda was there to meet us even with a delayed flight. She was very nice and her home was just beautifully decorated. You can tell that she pays attention to detail! Thank you Mathilda and when we're in LA again we will definitely look for availability at your home! Thanks again!!! ,clean
"Mathilda is a great host. The pictures don't don't it justice, everything was clean and easily accessible. She was very responsive, any questions we had we answered almost immediately. I travel to Los Angles often so It was nice to find a place that was quiet and not too far outside the city. There are grocery stores, restaurants, & pharmacies all less than 5 mins away. I definitely recommend this place to everyone. ",clean
"The location was perfect for our family stay.  Close to the city, but not in it.  Across the street from a school, but still very quiet.  Cute little street where a lot of neighbors were walking their dogs.  All of the amenities were in working condition and most were very modern.  It wasn't as big as the picture I had in my head, but it felt very safe and cozy.",location
"We loved staying at Mathilda's during our new home Renovation.  The place is so quaint and perfectly decorated. It's actually a magical little abode.  I can't quite put my finger on it but our children loved it immediately. <br/><br/>We live in LA & can definitely say it's a great location and centrally located to everything without being right in the 'gunk' of the city. I would rent Mathilda's place just to get away and write Bc it's an inspiring space to be in. Very warm, inviting and the beds, bedding, shower, is supremely comfortable. She's available if you need her but also you could enjoy the stay and never see her once, if that's what you prefer and still have all of your needs met. It's great!<br/><br/>This was by far the best Airbnb we've had so far. ",location
"We had a deligtful week at your Posada. The place has comfortable quarters inside and a cozy ,intimate patio outside. <br/>We would highly recommend the app. Already making plans to return!<br/>Dr. and Mrs Roberto Sozzi M.D.",location
"A fantastic option for a family holiday. Comfortable, interesting, thoughtfully organised and decorated - it felt like a real Californian experience. It is also a safe and practical space for guests with a baby/toddler (like us). Contact with Mathilda was always instantaneous and she was very accommodating to our needs. Parking was always available just outside the property. Highly recommended.",location
Great kitchen.  So glad there was 1.5 baths!  Sweet little outdoor seating.  Loved the thoughtful and tasteful interior design.,clean
"A gorgeous, clean, cosy home with everything that we needed!! We felt like we were at home. Love the quiet neighbourhood. Mathilda was a perfect host. Thank you!!",clean
"Mathilda was an excellent host and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay in her home.  The house was very clean and exactly as pictured in the ad.  It was centrally located and close to everything we wanted to do and see while we were vacationing in California.  Thank you, Mathilda, for helping to make our first family trip so great! ",clean
"Mathilda is a warm, responsive and helpful hostess. The Posada is a very creative, comfortable space. Mathilda has put much thought into making the Posada fun, relaxing and functional. (Have you ever stayed in a place where there is no place to easily store your clothes, personal items or hang your towels?  Not the case here....there is amply storage so items are out of the way and organized.) There are many interesting and eclectic decorations and accents, making your stay a delightful experience. The bedrooms are across the apartment from each other and with the half bath it is easy to share the space with friends or family. The garden seating area was private and perfect to start or end the day. We started every morning there with our coffee in hand. My friend and I will return on our next trip to Sherman Oaks!",clean
"We had a wonderful stay. This house was beautiful, spacious, comfortable, and perfect for our family's extended stay in LA. Our host was extremely welcoming, quick to respond with inquiries, and helpful. We would recommend this to everyone looking to stay in the area! Not far to the beach or downtown, and even Disneyland in Anaheim was a reasonable day trip. We so loved the private yard and grill, gorgeous modern decor, and useful space. ",location
"We loved Mathilda's place!  Gorgeous, secluded and peaceful :)",location
"This is a lovely little place, hidden from view and tucked away.  It has everything you need for a comfortable stay.  As Mathilda was away, all of our communication was with her daughter Zoe and she was quick to respond to all of our needs.  The location was perfect for us, we truly enjoyed our time here and will definitely stay here again if the opportunity presents itself! ",location
"We stayed in Mathilda's apartment with our 14 month old baby. Before our stay, Mathilda mentioned that she has a pack n play but I never confirmed that we need it, just assumed that it will already be in the apartment. When we arrived, the pack n play was not in the apartment and I messaged her. She brought it in 15 min which saved our day! :) I also loved the fact that we had a big bottle of cold water in the refrigerator when we arrived. ;)",clean
"This is great place if you want to hang at the beach during the day, and on 2nd street in the evening.",location
Fantastic quiet location - close to lots of Food & Fun,location
Awesome place! Will definitely be staying here again!,location
"Great place.  Easy check in and parking.  Nice showers.  Cool, fun, eclectic vibe.",clean
Comfortable and well laid out space that served my colleague and my needs well during a week-long work trip. Also surprisingly quiet and secluded despite being in the midst of a suburban neighborhood. ,location
The house was functional with the basic needs.~like kitchen supplies. The house is near a supermarket. It's capable of having 6 people. Mathilda was always available to answer questions and provide suggestions. She's kind.,clean
"I stayed at Matilda's place with my husband, 2 year old son and 4 year old daughter while we visited family nearby. The unit is very tastefully decorated and we had  a  pleasant stay.",location
Mathilda's cottage is perfect for families. The place is very bright with lots of natural light. The beds are very comfortable and there is plenty of storage space. The desert landscape and fruit trees make the yard a good place to relax.  The space is very private and well lit at night so it always feels safe.I would definitely recommend it.,location
"I did not stay in Mathilda's Airbnb, however three of our employees did (including two new hires), and I heard nothing but great things about their stay.  They loved the decor, and felt comfortable in the house.  Plus they said it was in a convenient location.<br/><br/>Working with Mathilda was a pleasure because she communicated often, and was very accommodating.  :)",host
Mathilda was very easy to communicate with and even called to make sure we knew where to move our cars the last morning we were there due to some road work that was being done that day.  The place had everything we needed (she seemed to have thought of everything) and the place was very clean and comfortable.  Would stay again in a heartbeat!,clean
"Incredible place, incredible host. Mathilda was very nice and on point with communication. The place is beautiful and very warm. 10 minute walk and to local restaurants and supermarket is in the area. Thanks again Mathilda.",location

Great place. Tastefully decorated. Convenient location if you need to be in Encino or Sherman Oaks. Helpful owner.,location

Great! Thank you!,clean
Great place and Mathilda was an excellent host.,location
Wonderful home! Very clean and spacious. The location was perfect! Mathilda was a wonderful host!! We recommend to everyone and anyone and we will be back! Thanks again!!!,clean
"I can't say enough good things about this space. Very beautiful and comfortable, felt like a home away from home. You have a gated private garden all to yourself, which was an incredibly nice amenity we took advantage of daily. Watch hummingbirds dart among the orange trees and birds-of-paradise... It's on a quiet street, but a short drive to all the magic of LA. Mathilda is a perfect host, and was quick to respond when we had questions. We look forward to picking her brain next time we do some redecorating at home - love her style!",location
"Somethings have to be experienced personally, that way your individual taste can make its evaluation. But I promise...you wonât be disappointed at Mathildaâs place!!!!",location

"Mathilda was incredibly responsive and helpful. There were several extra sleeping spaces had we needed it. We spent a good deal of time using the BBQ in the stone garden, and while the yard was dusty and hot, the citrus trees on the property gave delicious fruit! Thank You Mathilda!",location
"An excellent, clean, comfortable and relaxing space in a nice area w a great host. Definitely coming back!<br/>",clean

"Great Location for all things North LA.  <br/>Interior was very nice, great interior design features.  Everything worked well.  Super clean!   The one con was the garden was neglected, so we didnât use it on our stay. But, it was private.  Great value.",clean
"Such a gem! Space was bigger than expected and had a full kitchenette including a hot plate, pans, pots, and more. I felt safe and comfortable my entire stay! Great location to be a little secluded but also close enough go down to the beach in 20 short minutes.",location
Mathilda's Posada de Sherman Oaks is a beautiful space that is well worth the $. I suggest the Posada to anyone looking to get away to a stylish spot close to the best SoCal has to offer.,location
Small but comfortable place. This is a single family home split in two so you have the owner on the other side of the wall just FYI.,space
Mathildaâs home was absolutely perfect for our stay!  It was very clean and had everything we need.  The location is central but also quiet and peaceful.  Mathilda was quick to respond to all of our needs.  Highly recommend!,clean
Such a lovely host!! Great looking place amazing location and super clean. Will come back as soon as I can!!,clean
"Everything you could want and more! I was in town to see my 4 month old daughter, and this place was such an amazing fit! There was a pack & play, plenty of space and a gorgeous yard space, and this was all for a reasonable price. Communication was on-point and I canât say enough great things about Mathildaâs clean and accommodating space! Highly recommend!",clean
This is a super little houseâequipped with everything and a surprising outdoor space. It is exactly as shown but was nicer when sitting in it (the outdoor space) than expected. House is very stylish in a simple way so really nice to be in. Has excellent coffeeâbring your own milk of course if you want that. Mathilda is a great host with quick communicationsâ& easy check-in.,clean
Beautifully decorated home in a great location.,location
"My friends and I enjoyed our stay at Mathildaâs. We liked the location, it was nice, quiet and private. She was quick to respond to any questions we had and the house felt rustic and modern. We enjoyed our stay and we will book her place the next time we are in town.",location

"Perfect place for visit to Sherman Oaks, Studio City and the greater Los Angeles area",location
"Mathilda is a great host we had several contact moments before our arrival which gave us a good and positive feeling. <br/>Mathilda was our second experience with airbnb and we felt very at home and comfortable. The house is lovely and with a personal touch. It feels like you are staying with people you already knew for years. <br/>Very clean and enough fresh linnen and towels for all of us. We visited with our two adult daughters and both of their friends. <br/>Mathilda lives very close and is very responsive when we needed her she answered right away. The neighbourhood is quiet and busy and dynamic Los Angeles is just around the corner. Hollywood, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills or the studios: all within 30 minutes by Uber. We loved staying at the posada.",clean
This is a great place with lots of sweet touches. I will definitely stay here again,location
"This was my second time staying here, and it was equally as great as my first stay! I come here from Iowa to visit my daughter, who is an infant, and the pack n play is a huge help, and itâs very well-suited for having a child there! Not a problem with this place.",clean
"Great experience! We plan to stay here again next time we are in town. Super cute place with everything we needed. Very convenient location, clean, and owner is very helpful. We enjoyed it!",clean
So nice as the pictures shows and Mathilda is an amazing hostage.,location
"This is an amazing place, super comfortable, and literally every need has been considered! Extremely and highly recommended rental!",location
Such a great find! Stayed with our toddler and had plenty of room to spread out and everything was spotless and easy to find.,clean
"Great Stay!  Even better in person.  My wife and I stayed here for a quick weekend getaway and Mathilda's place was perfect!  More than enough space for a romantic getaway or a short stay for two couples.  The unit was spotless upon entering and the pictures don't do this place justice.  Ultra private space in a peaceful and quiet neighborhood.  If you check-out on a weekday; just keep in mind the side streets are a little busier than usual in the morning as there is a school nearby.  A supermarket plus several take-out/delivery options are nearby.  The dedicated parking space was beneficial, and the unit was easily accessible from the highway. The bed was comfortable and the living space was great for daytime lounging.  The outdoor patio was private, perfect for grilling and just taking in the sun.  Would definitely stay here again!",clean
Fabulous place and location is excellent. Really enjoyed our stay,location
"Mathildaâs place is in a very quiet, safe, convenient location in Sherman Oaks. Check-in instructions were very clear and easy to follow. The home was clean, had all necessary amenities, and the beds were comfortable. <br/>We used Lyft because I dreaded driving in LA traffic and there was always one within 3-5 minutes available. If you would choose to drive, the private off-street parking looked convenient, and there was plenty of additional on-street parking. <br/>The neighborhood was extremely safe and we took several walks to the local grocery store (Ralphâs) which was about half a mile away.  <br/>The highlight of the location is Mathildaâs interior decorating talent.  Seems like you are on a HGTV show.",location
"Lovely place -- inside and out -- full of artistic touches, carefully curated books and comfortable beds.   Super clean  too!",clean
Great stay! Lots to do near by. The bike availability was a great amenity,location
Very clean and nice relaxing stay. Easy check in.,clean
"We had the most wonderful stay in Sherman Oaks at this charming, cozy place in close proximity to our family as well as to points south in LA. Mathilda was very communicative and quick with responses, check in and check out were a breeze, and the place was an absolute gem of Santa Fe aesthetics.  Great modern kitchen and appliances. Highly recommend this wonderful space!!!",location
Itâs everything you need,clean
"The home has interesting art pieces, was very clean and quiet, and wasnât too far to the local attractions we saw in LA. Would stay again",clean
This space is exactly as advertised. It was perfect and the host is very responsive!,clean
"My husband and I stayed here while visiting a friend in LA and we had a great little space to hang out! It was private, and quiet even though we had people staying in the adjoining unit. Worth the money, and great shower with shampoo and conditioner which came in handy ( I forgot my conditioner at home).",space
Will definitely stay here on my next visit.,location
"Very friendly host, Mathilda made our stay very comfortable and special.  Whenever we had a question, she responded like she was just waiting for us.  Every corner of the place had her artistic touch and the place was more than just clean and comfortable.  Skylights were especially nice, as the whole place was nice and bright every morning.  One full bathroom and another 1/2 bathroom made it very convenient for our family in the morning when we wanted to quickly get ready to go out.  The location was good enough, as it was close to a major highway.  The neighbourhood was very quiet and safe.  The garden was very nice with cactuses, and also an orange tree.  Patio was very nice to allow us to sit outside in the sun.  Washer and dryer were outside of the house and needed to be shared among other guests, which was a bit of a surprise, but not a problem.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, and I would love to return to it whenever I visit LA.  Thanks, Mathilda for everything.",clean
"Mathildaâs place was adorable! It was immaculate and extremely comfortable and perfect for my son, his girlfriend, and I as we visited California for a wedding. It had an extremely open, fresh, artistic vibe, and everything we needed (and much more.) We particularly liked the lovely little patio/yard with picnic table and swing and birds and an orange tree and Bougainvillea and Ligustrum! We could hear birds singing at all times. It was lovely. The neighborhood was quiet and pleasant and safe. We were able to Uber quickly and easily to Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Malibu, UCLA, and LAX. We may well try to book Mathildaâs place on future trips to visit my newly-married son in LA!",location
"Mathildaâs home is amazing! Everything is well kept and organized and the front yard is beautiful. Itâs relatively close to a supermarket, CVS, and Chase by a 10 min walk and a 15-20 minute drive from Los Angeles. I would stay here again if I could.",clean
"Great spot in Sherman Oaks. Mathilde was really responsive and helpful and the property is very cozy and quiet. We enjoyed sitting outside in the evening, everything worked well, and the location is great. We will be back as our daughter lives close by.",location
Everything met our expectations.,clean
"Mathilda is a great host, she was very accommodating to all of our needs! She really went out of her way to help us any time we needed it. <br/><br/>The property is cute, especially the backyard. The backyard is much nicer than it looks in the pictures, itâs a great place to relax or work from home. The parking is convenient and the Wi-Fi is reliable and fast.  <br/><br/>One thing to note is that the walls are quite thin and being the middle unit between two others in the house, you could often hear the neighbors and occasionally smell what the neighbors were cooking which made it feel less private. But overall we had a great stay, 5 stars!",location
Special oasis! My mom and I could not have been happier with our stay!,clean
"This was the perfect place for me and my husband and our 2 kiddos (12,3). It was close enough to all the LA attractions without being in the middle of the city which was just perfect for us. The outside was a perfect relaxing area as well as inside. It was also very convenient that there was a half bath so the shower didnât tie up the whole bathroom. We had so much fun. We would definitely stay at Mathildaâs place again!",location
"I was concerned about the size of the space when I first found this place, but it was absolutely perfect for what was needed. Everything is new and updated, and lots of privacy. The little yard was a nice retreat during the LA summer.<br/><br/>One thing I should point out is that the unit is part of a larger house that has been split into multiple units, but it is not a shared space. Occasionally, you could hear some of the other guests,l through the walls in the main bedroom, but itâs not really a problem to be concerned with.<br/><br/>I would rent this place again in a heartbeat.",location
The home is very clean.  We did not like the steps throughout the house (we both walk with canes and steps were difficult).  Very limited TV viewing.  We couldnât get local news and weather and no basic network programming.,clean
Great home base for all the things to do in Malibu and Topanga,location
Great place! Really enjoyed my time in Topanga and having this as my home base.,location
Wow!  What a great place to stay at all around.  Beautiful view to admire all day long and about a three minute walk to Rosieâs Dog Beach.  Couldnât have asked for a better deal.  Definitely book this place!!,location
"Couldnât have been better. <br/>Very tidy and lovely AirBnb  equipped with everything you need. A good bed and a nice bathroom, has all the necessities for a few nights (bed, mini-fridge, hot shower, hair dryer, etc.) . Ryan is a fantastic host and is there when you need him, super nice and wants to share all he knows about the area. We had a great stay and would definitely stay here again!",clean

Great location for food and activities. Easy check in and all the amenities are great.,location
"We planned to work remotely from Kellyâs place so we stayed here 5 days before Christmas. Our mini holiday before joining our family who live locally.<br/><br/>The location was perfect, very relaxing to look out the window every day to see the water. We went to the beach before starting work and after work. The place is cozy,  the size just perfect for a couple. <br/>The wow factor was the festive holiday lights display that comes  alive every night. What a great treat the city has provided for the public to enjoy. Truly a memorable experience to see Long Beach at Christmas. Thank you Kelly.",location
"Amazing location, absolutely unbeatable. Great use of space thanks to a Murphy bed. We were able to have my parents over for dinner and it didn't feel crowded at all. Kelley was also super communicative and a perfect host",location
"The place was gorgeous! The view was beautiful and the inside was the perfect size for two people. The place was close to so many shops and restaurants which were all fun and easy to pick-up or sit down. <br/>Loved how close we were to the beach/canal area. It was lovely weather and we kayaked which was one of my favorite moments of our trip.<br/>Thanks so much for a fun, relaxing stay!",location
Ryanâs home and Airbnb space are beautiful. All the amenities and the location are unbeatable. Only a short drive down to the beach. The space is modern and minimal. Itâs a very serene setting and itâll be a great place to wind down after a long day out and about. I recommend this host!,location
This is a great studio and home base for exploring Malibu and the Topanga area. This is for those who love nature and simplicity. Awesome stay and we loved exploring!,location
A real gem of a place! Tucked neatly up in the hills of Topanga with close proximity to all the retail in Pacific Palisades and Malibu Country Mart.,location
At first itâs a little intimidating getting there but after you get use to it even the drive is absolutely amazing! The hikes nearby have incredible views and itâs a short distance from everything.,location
"The description was very accurate.  In fact, I was pleasantly surprised that in that the interior of the apartment looked much better in person than in the pictures.  The neighborhood is friendly, but finding parking was a bit difficult.  To be fair, it is always a nightmare trying to find parking in LA, and we were able to find a spot around the block.  Kahlil has a generous movie collection, and we spent our night very comfortably.  The bathroom and shower were very nice and clean.  I would highly recommend this listing, and I will definitely be back.  Being 10 minutes from LAX is very convenient, as LA traffic is nightmarish and the time we saved was well worth it.",clean
"This place was great-clean, large, and a very very comfy bed. It's a really quick drive to the airport and Kahlil texted me a few times to make sure everything was going well and that I was happy. Super great stay. I would definitely stay again, on a future trip to LA. -Madelein ",clean
"Great apartment! Very clean and cozy, quiet area, and had everything you'd ever need. Had parking for a rental which was great. Close to LAX and highway to get around fast and easy.<br/>Kahlil is a great host and texts back in short time.",clean
"We had excellent communication with Kahlil. The apartment was clean and comfortable. It looks better than the pictures. It's very close to grocery store, LAX, and easy access to interstates. 30-45 min to Disneyland, 30-45 min to Hollywood. A good central location.  ",clean
"The host provided, within reason and then more, all necessary to have a nice stay. The neighborhood by no means is luxurious but the neighbors were polite and accommodating.",location
Khalil space was perfect for everything I needed to do in my trip. Not too far from any great eating spots and catching unwed from his locations cost no more than 15 dollars. Very homey and clean and the neighborhood is solo friendly. Would definitely stay here again.  ,clean
Clean place. Very straight forward. Parking and apartment are clearly labeled. Great bang for your buck.,clean
" Kahill was very hospitable and made it easy to check in with his high tech electronic code lock which was very easy to use. He has free cable TV,  Wi-Fi, free movies and a full kitchen.  The place was accurately described. The neighborhood was fine. The location, high tech and price (including no cleaning fee) made this worth it for sure. Kahill knows how to deliver more than promised.",location
"Kahlil was GREAT...he was quick to respond and communicated well.  We had a problem getting the lock to work properly when we left our first morning, but Kahlil took care of it before we returned later that day and sent us a text to let us know the problem was resolved.  The apartment was in a convenient location, and the bed was very comfortable--we slept really well.  We were there in August during a heat wave, so after leaving it off all day (trying to be eco-responsible), the window air conditioning unit in the living room took a couple of hours to cool down the bedroom (we doubly appreciated the bedroom ceiling fan).  The apartment was nice and clean, but was not as uncluttered as depicted in the photos: there were a few boxes of miscellaneous items on the floor in a couple of the rooms.  There was no room to hang anything in the closet because it was so full (we were there for a wedding and needed to hang some things).  The mini blinds in the bedroom were in bad shape and let in light from the street.  Overall though, the excellent price, comfy bed and central location made up for these minor concerns.  Kahlil was really easy to work with and was very responsive.",clean
"Khalil was very accommodating and flexible.  The listing was advertised for 4 and when I called to see if a 5th could stay, he had no problem with it.",clean
"Great apartment, great location with easy access to all tourist areas. Really comfy bed, lots to watch on TV and of course a parking space next to apartment. Would recommend a stay here as Kahil is very communicative and helpful ",location
"The apartment was very nice.  Very clean and spacious.  We were 4 people and we're very comfortable.  We didn't meet Khalil,  but he was very kind and very helpful over the phone.  A great place for a great price. ",clean
It is a nice little apartment in a quiet neighborhood.<br/>Walking distance to 99cents & Ralph supermarkets. <br/><br/>,location
Khalil was very communicative and polite. The place is not in a luxurious neighborhood but it is great. It's near every main tourist attraction (30 min by car) and has a great parking spot. The place was clean and well organized when we got there. We had some problems with the dryer machine but Khalil made sure everything was fixed very quickly. I would definitely come back.,clean
"Though I never met Kahlil in person, we were in communication via text and email. The apartment is small, but big enough for a 3 person family, or a trio of friends (queen bed, and a couch). Minor hiccups were addressed with the host, and didn't at all take the focus away of a private home for a very reasonable price. I wasn't very keen on the neighborhood, as it was a bit nosy at night, and not very close to any restaurants or tourist spots; but that's just my preference. Overall it was a good experience.  ",space
"My girlfriend and I booked this unit while transitioning to Los Angeles. It was a perfect fit for our needs and Kahlil was extremely helpful in responsive whenever we had questions. The neighborhood is great, with groceries and other amenities within walking distance. ",location
"Kahlil's apartment is a spacious apartment very centrally located right outside of LA (10 mins to LAX, 15-20 minutes to downtown LA). For the price you pay, you can't really go wrong. It's not the cleanest Airbnb I have stayed at, but then again not the dirtiest. The bed is actually really comfortable, as I believe it is some kind of memory form/tempurpedic bed, which was a huge plus after long day of exploring LA. My only real gripe here was that there was a water leak around 6pm on Saturday night and the land lord shut the water off around a little over an hour to fix it. This wouldn't have been as big of a deal if my girlfriend and I didn't have dinner reservations at 7:30 in LA and we both needed to shower. This is something 100% out of Kahlil's control, but just something I wanted to note. Overall, if I was traveling back to LA on a budget, I would definitely consider this apartment again. Thanks Kahlil!",clean
"Check-in and check-out was very straight forward. Kahlil did a great job of explaining it. Stayed here with a friend for a conference at a local gym. Wouldn't bring my wife here, but it served its purpose for me.",clean
"The listing description is accurate. Actually, the apartment was better than it was on pictures, bright and clean, great parking. Full kitchen and comfortable bed.<br/>It's a bit far from all the tourists spots (1 hour with traffic), but you can't beat the price.<br/>",clean

The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.,clean
"Great place to stay, had no problems. Air conditioned, super comfy bed, extra couch available to have a third friend stay. Everything was really clean, had Netflix available. Walking distance to a Walgreens & close to the airport for a quick uber there. Would definitely stay there again when visiting.",clean
"Kahlil made the process very simple and straightforward, emailed me all of the information about the place the day before we arrived. The description of the place was pretty accurate to what it was in reality, it was nice having a parking space and not having to worry about finding a spot. Overall a great experience ",location

"Good directions from the hosts on parking and ""checking in"". The apartment is a nice size and fully stocked to live comfortably for the week we were there. We bought our own food and there wasn't much room in the fridge but no big deal. Great range of all kinds of movies, Roku, living room set-up. Pull out couch for extra guests is a bonus. The bed is very comfortable! Very pleasant breeze coming into the bedroom in the morning. Plenty of towels, though no laundry. Laundromat and grocery store around the corner though. The neighborhood was decent, parking is behind the building. We felt very safe each night. Great space for the price",clean

Many people said the neighborhood is known to be bad but was very quiet during our stay no one bothered us neighbors were very nice. Had a spot for parking which was great and included different amenities that we needed (fridge, stove, dishes, freezer, microwave, iron, etc) we did not need to contact Khalil for anything everything was right there for us.

Kahlil's place was in a good location to a lot of main points we wanted to be. I would recommend checking in at a normal hour of the night as we did not and were unable to get in due to a malfunction with the lock. Other than that the place seemed to be exactly as portrayed. ,clean

His instructions in the welcome and around the apartment are very helpful, and he was very responsive answering our questions during our visit. Great experience.",price

"This was my first time booking an air bnb and I couldnât be happier with this expierence. We traveled to California for a concert at The Forum, which mind you was like 5 minutes away from Kahlilâs apt, so that was great.  Kahlil is a wonderful host, allowed us check in early since we got in town a tad bit earlier than expected and he even let us stay an extra day (we loved it so much we had to stay one more day) Kahlilâs apt had everything you could need, litterally almost felt like home!

Stellar location for this beach rental! The view is amazing and there is so much to do within walking distance.  Naples Island is a beautiful place to walk along the canal.

"My husband and I had a great time in sunny California and enjoyed staying at Kelley's place. Everything is exactly like it is written or shown in the description.

We didn't need to rent a car because we could walk, bike, or Lyft anywhere we needed to go. :) Kelley was super nice and responsive. I would 100% stay here again!",location
"Kelleyâs place was the perfect location to enjoy Long Beach. The view was gorgeous and we had everything we needed. The nearby neighborhood is very walkable and it only took a few minutes to walk to nearby coffee shops and restaurants. The only concern we had is that since the bed is a Murphy bed, it was not as comfortable as a stationery bed.  Overall we would definitely stay again if we are able to visit the area again.",location

If you just want to sit out on the deck and relax, there is so much to watch on the street and in the water just out front.  Unit has everything you need to make your stay comfortable. Very enjoyable.",location
We were in Long Beach for our granddaughters wedding so it was a perfect place to crash in between events. I loved to sit on the deck where I liked relax and watch what was going on.,location
Perfect location!,location
Absolutely stunning views and location! I will be staying here again! I was so sad to leave.,location
"Kâs home was beautiful and the perfect size for my boyfriend and I to stay for the weekend. It has a good parking spot and in a quiet neighborhood. K made sure to provide us with our access code well before our arrival time and we had no complications finding the place or getting in. We felt safe and secure in this home. They had comfy couches and an extremely comfortable bed. There are also two mounted TVs where you can watch Netflix or YouTube on. They also have the basics such as a microwave, blender, pots, pans, cooking supplies etc. The one thing we could not seem to find were spoons lol, but we managed. Overall we had a great stay in Kâs place and will definitely keep this open as an option for future stays in La.",location

Wonderful place to stay if you're looking to enjoy all the area has to offer! Easy access to some awesome trails and beautiful beaches. You're close to everything without all the traffic and noise.,location
Ryan was a great Airbnb host and communicated well throughout the trip. There were local wildfires during our stay making my girlfriend a little Uneasy but Ryan reassured us and was very communicative during our stay,host
Super host. Excellent and friendly communication. Cleanliness 10/10. Quiet and cozy overall. Close enough to Topanga beach but away from all the noise. Offers good sanitizing and disinfectant options. Recommended.,clean
"Ryan's place had everything we needed: big bed with comfy pillows, TV + Wifi, and a shower with bodywash/shampoo/conditioner. Although we didn't use the electric hotplate to cook, it was nice knowing we had that option. The place was clean and spacious enough for a couple. The only thing I would people about is the drive up to the house: it's a one-lane two-way road that takes some confidence to trek up if you're not comfortable. Definitely a unique experience driving up, and worth the drive up once you get there.",clean
"The apartment was clean, smelled good and was just as pictured. Itâs situated in a great location that is close to both the beach and city! Ryan was a great host. Highly recommend.",clean
"Great stay! The location was beautiful. Perfectly removed and peaceful but close to Santa Monica, Malibu, and LA in general. Ryan was extremely welcoming, accessible, and friendly. He went above and beyond to offer his help, and added a few nice touches in the studio, such as a small cooler, beach towels, and bathroom necessities. Would definitely stay again",location
"Great place and host! Clean, spacious, convenient place. Host was also very kind and flexible. Would recommend staying here and enjoying the mountains.",location
Great location and Ryan is super friendly and helpful!!,location
"Ryan's place was great for a short stay away from LA. Within 10 minutes, you can drive to beautiful mountain paths, or down to a relatively empty beach. It's got the best of all worlds. Ryan was also very helpful in recommending local spots, and he was available if we needed any assistance. The space has all you'll need, even an electric burner and mini fridge. The bed is comfortable, and the wifi works decently. Be warned that the cell reception up there is nonexistent, and the drive up and down the mountain is scary - the road is thin and twisty, and it can be especially daunting driving up in the dark.",location
"Love Kellyâs home!! The location was everything. One day was spent on a Duffy boat. The next day was spent on the beach with my grandkids we had such a good time. Kelly has chairâs , umbrellaâs and buckets for the kids to use. My fiancÃ© and I love   people watching from the balcony. The Murphy bed was a really comfortable bed. I was surprised how comfortable it was.  We hope to visit again",location

"The bay shore apartment was wonderful and kelly was always helpful and quick to return a message when questions arose. I stayed for two months and had no problems. The neighbors were all laid back and happy to have drinks on the porch, suggest restaurants, and offer local tips. The apartment was in a great location with access to 2nd street and the ocean. The beach gets a little wild on weekends and holidays, which makes the back apartment and the private deck very worthwhile. <br/><br/>Had a great experience, would do it again. ",location
"Great place: location location location! It's near the beaches, museums, and LA. The local community is worth checking-out: lots to explore: hikes, cycling, shops and restaurants.",location
"Place is awesome and cozy, 10 minutes from PCH and Malibu beaches. Would highly recommend",location
"This was the perfect place for my staycation. It felt like a home away from home. The studio was actually roomier than the photos yet still had a cozy vibe. I definitely felt far from the city, which was exactly how I hoped to feel. What makes this stay so awesome is its close proximity to fun activities. I love having options and not having to go too far. Ryan was very attentive. Loved sitting on the patio in the morning with my coffee and watching the wildlife forage for breakfast. I will definitely be back!",location
"This place was an absolute perfect stay for my partner and I! Malibu and Santa Monica are all at a near distance so that was pretty great! The place overall was very clean, organized, and pretty spacious for the both of us. Ryan was super great in communicating with whatever that we needed. One thing is there was no service as soon as you get up here but there was Wi-Fi provided so that was pretty sweet! If my partner and I ever want to come back and explore Malibu or Santa Monica some more weâll definitely consider coming back to this place again! Thanks to Ryan for making this place a great stay for us both!",clean

First off let me just say the couches felt amaaaazing! And the bed also. I Love K's home. I really appreciate the water bottles and coffee that were available to us. Let's not forget the two tv's and all the movies you can watch! A great place to relax. Quiet and safe. Manhattan beach only a 15 min drive also.

"K's place is an excellent value.  Location is great.  His place is within minutes to the major highways and food and supermarket are just around the corner.  The area is residential and we feel safe staying here.  The best part is you can park in the designated carport spot.  Most hotels in the area charge 12-20 bux per night for parking.  We're lucky his apt was available, save us some money .  The location is also very close to the airport.  And most of all you get the private space to yourself.",location
This was my second stay here. I had to come into town on short notice so I booked the day before my arrival and K was still able to accomodate me in such a short time! The space was clean and private and had everything I needed.,clean

Very clean and homey. Highly recommend this place to any one looking for a place to stay. K left detailed instructions for heating, AC, TV, and WiFi. Book this place!",clean
"I last minute needed a place to stay in LA because my mom needed her expired passport expedited for bereavement purposes. I booked the night before and K was quick in accepting our booking. <br/>Itâs really close to the airport and the passport office, so that was a huge plus.

"K was a great host from start to finish. We received prompt responses and K made it easy to add a day to our stay when our plans changed. We arrived at LAX at about 11:30 p.m. and after getting our car, we were so ready for a lovely Airbnb home. We made it to K's apartment at around 1:00 a.m. I have to say I was a little worried to be arriving so late and so tired. Would we find the apartment? What about parking? All my concerns were an absolute waste of time! Everything was as smooth as can be! The home was easy to find, parking was well marked, the combination lock worked exactly as described and we opened the door to a wonderfully comfortable apartment, a warm bed, clean bathroom, chilled bottled water in the fridge and coffee for the morning. We stayed for 3 days and found the neighborhood had everthing we needed within minutes of the house: easy highway access, plenty of shopping, good restaurants, even an ice cream truck driving through the streets delighting the neighborhood kids. Netflix and other films were available for our evenings, and there were plenty of cooking supplies for morning breakfasts. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!",clean
"We are very satisfied with our holiday here, and are glad that we chose this apartment. Kelly always replies quickly to any queries, she is very amiable, can recommend good places in and outside LA, and is always ready to help out if needed. The location is perfect for a beach holiday, one can always swim, go kayaking, power-boarding, ride a bicycle by the ocean or just enjoy the walk. There are two separate lines at the beach, one for runners, and one for cyclers, what is extremely convenient. The water is clean, and cool and is perfect for swimming. Plus, the place does not get too crowded ever, slightly more people at the weekend than during the weekday. Many shops are in walking distance, and there are splendid restaurants on the 2nd Avenue. The neighbor next door is a very good and friendly man, with a very good attitude, and it was always interesting to chat with him. He also was ready to give advice and help, when needed. The neighborhood in general is very safe, nice and friendly. In general, this place would suit different types of people with different holiday interests, from a family holiday to a sport holiday, in any case, one should be assured that she will have a safe and interesting one.",location
We had a great trip to Long Beach.  The apartment was very nice.  It was clean and very comfortable.  The neighbors were friendly and the location was perfect. Kelly was great.  This was our first experience with Airbnb; will definitely try to stay with Kelly again. ,clean

I felt safe there , and the neighbors are so friendly .<br/>The glass door is such a great idea as it lets the sun shine through the living room. It's so convenient to have a washer and dryer on site.<br/>Kelley answers quickly and is always ready to help  ; she and her husband are nice and welcoming .<br/>I will certainly try to come back there next time i come  to Long Beach.<br/>Thanks Kelley",location
This place was great. Great location. his was a wonderful experience! Kelley was quick to respond before and during the trip started.

"We had a wonderful time staying at Kelly's Long Beach apartment! There is no better location in the Long Beach area. It is perfectly situated between outdoor activities, such as kayaking and stand up paddle boarding and within walking distance from 2nd street which is full of restaurants, shops and entertainment. Having lived in the Los Angeles area for 15 years we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay.  The apartment is quiet, clean and Kelly was a wonderful host. We would recommend this rental to any couple who is interested in a great get away.",location
Very nice place to stay. The bed is super comfy!,location
We had a wonderful time. House was cozy and comfy. Internet was bit slow at times but cozy bed and sofa made up for it. Well lit and cool. Would definitely recommend and return. Thankyou,clean
"My fiancÃ© and I stayed at Kâs place for our last romantic trip before our bundle of joy arrives in August. The bed is super comfortable! The couch is also comfortable(I took several naps there) Also, the water temperature and pressure in the shower is amazing. The location was close to everything we wanted to do. When we arrived it was a little chilly(first time in LA) so we didnât know what to expect at night. So I asked about heat and she responded within a few mins. Heat was kicking and we were happy! Kâs place is your comfort zone! Highly recommend this place. <br/><br/>S.N.- Ice cream truck comes everyday on the block.",location
Easy check in and check out. K had great communication throughout our stay. <br/>The bed was super comfortable. The couches are huge and great for sleeping. <br/>No complaints. Great place.,location
"Kâs unit has all you need for a comfortable stay. The location is very convenient as it is close to shops, gas station, carwash and connecting freeways.",location
Great place to stay with assigned parking. Location was close to LAX and near the freeway. I appreciated that K checked in with us and had clear communication and responded quickly. Would recommend staying at this place!,location
"Great place to stay close to the airport and near beaches in LA! Parking spot was a plus, comfortable bed and couch space. Easy self check in without needing to remember a key when leaving the place. Iâd stay here again!",location
"Very nice apartment! Clean, great location by LAX, grocery stores and restaurants. Parking is a little hard at night but only if you have 2 cars, the Airbnb comes with 1 reserved spot. We will definitely be staying there again, thanks K!",clean
Great place to stay! Very close to the airport and many beaches around too. Would definitely stay here again.,location
Perfect for my stay,clean
"This apartment was a great little find, it was on a quite little residential street and an ice cream truck drove by everyday. Close to the beach to!",location
"My wife and we're absolutely enchanted by Topanga and this peaceful, tucked away little flat. Close enough to the beach and the city, while also being removed enough to avoid all the noise. Ryan was communicative, knowledgeable and kind and the apartment was clean and comfortable.",clean
Incredible place. Commuting to work was easy (15 min to Venice beach) and coming back to this gem in the evening was special. Tuna canyon state park is also pretty awesome.,location
"good location, excellent cleanliness, perfect to rest and enjoy the beaches",clean
Loved our stay here! Ryan was super nice and helpful. The guest house was clean and had a big comfy bed with lots of natural light. We will be coming back for our next stay in Topanga!,clean
"The location is fantastic, far enough from the main road that you donât hear any traffic but close enough for a short drive to the beach. Lots of suggestions from Ryan on places to eat, go, beaches etc. Everything you need is in the suite, which is bigger than it appears in pictures. Would definitely stay again!!",location
"Had the pleasure of meeting Kelley upon arrival and she was an absolute sweetheart. She provided great local recommendations for my daughter and I. The view of the beach right outside the condo was absolutely breathtaking. From a comfortable bed to a washer and dryer, the condo had everything one would need. Definitely booking with Kelley next year for my daughter's spring break.  ",location
Kelleys condo is really nice and had plenty of room. My husband and I were there for the Indy car races about 3 miles from Kelleys place. It was super easy to get to although the 2nd 3rd day we used uber because the parking at the races were quite challenging.  It was such a nice place to come home to after a long day.  The bed was so comfortable and the condo is very inviting. It is just steps away from the sandy beach. Very relaxing atmosphere. The neighbor downstairs let us know right away if there was anything they could do for us even though Kelley was very easy to reach ( I called her a few times since this was our first experience with airbnb ). Kelley was an excellent host and I would definitely love to come back here and be able to enjoy the beach a little more. Thank you Kelley ,location
"Kelley was amazing. Super prompt, accommodating and really the location is amazing. We will be back soon.",location
First time back to Belmont Shore in many years and we thoroughly enjoyed Kelley's one BR apartment overlooking Alamitos Bay! Very accomodating and with it's own private rear sundeck for the afternoon<br/>rays.  We'll definitely be return visitors the next time our travels take us to So. California.,location
"This was a great place to stay. We're from out of state but have family in town. Everyone could come and visit during the day. There's a beach just across the street. It's on a bay, so no surf or undertow - perfect for little kids. The ocean beach is just a short walk away, with bike and pedestrian paths. <br/>Kelley was very attentive. The OJ and blueberry muffins were a welcome surprise, and she personally came to fix a small problem in the apartment the first day. She also has GREAT neighbors in the other two apartments. You'll love getting to know them.<br/>The apartment is well laid out. Large shower, plenty of towels (a beach necessity), great bed, bikes to ride, full kitchen and accessories. Lots of windows for fresh air. There's a hose in back to wash off the beach sand (the grandkids loved it). While we usually found street parking, it was comforting to know we also had off-street parking available.<br/>We will definitely consider this location again if we return for another summer visit.",clean
"We enjoyed our stay at Kelly's Beach Apartment. The location is perfect and having onsite parking was so convenient.  Everything is as described, very clean and very comfortable.  We highly recommend Kelly's apartment and hope to return again soon. ",clean
"Kelley was so great and met us at the apartment when we got there to show us around. She was available for any problems we had, but thankfully we didn't have any! The neighborhood was great, and the neighbors were both very nice and friendly. The Belmont Shores beach is literally right across the street, and Long Beach is just two blocks down. We LOVED it! This is by far the best place we have stayed with Airbnb. 2nd street has so many shops and places to eat (and they are all good!). Our favorites were George's Greek Cafe and Roe, just a couple blocks away. <br/>The kitchen had all of the appliances for us to cook, which we were grateful for so we could eat in a couple times. The apartment is very comfortable. The worst part was having to leave. :( Thank you, Kelley! :)",location
What a great location! If we were not on the beach we would just open the front door and look across the bay. Excellent restaurants nearby too. Our first time using Airbnb and it was perfect. Kelley is a great communicator and provides about everything you need.,location
" When we arrived, the house was very clean. Directions were left regarding parking and WiFi. A few snacks were left for us in the kitchen which was totally appreciated. The neighbors.introduced themselves. Incredibly nice anday helpful people. The location of the place is so perfect because everything is in walking distance. I had a few questions and texted the owner. She always replied right away with a helpful solution. The beds were super comfortable, the kitchen well stocked and everything was truly exactly as I had hoped it would be.",clean
"My family absolutely loved our stay at Kelley's beach house. The location was perfect. The house had everything we needed. The kitchen was fully outfitted, the living room was comfortable and inviting, and the bedroom & sleeper sofa were very comfortable. The patio out the back door was a great private getaway and was a wonderful place to have my morning coffee.<br/><br/>The neighbors (upstairs and downstairs) were super nice and very helpful. The downstairs neighbors were great to hang out with and they let us use their kayak and paddle board throughout the week.<br/><br/>My whole family agrees that when we come back to Southern CA, we will do our best to book Kelley's beach house again. <br/><br/>Kelley was great to work with during the booking process and throughout our stay at her beach house. She communicated quickly and clearly and made our stay enjoyable and stress free. <br/><br/>On the area: we expected to use the beach house as a home base and head out to other beaches during our week. We had so much fun in Belmont Shore we ended up staying local all but one day. The house is across the street from Bayshore beach, all the shops and restaurants on 2nd Street are walking distance, the beach at Long Beach and the walking/biking trail is also walking distance. There is easy access to other beaches, but you may not find you need to go elsewhere very often with all the things available just outside your door. <br/><br/>Kelley, thanks again for a wonderful week and a fantastic Airbnb experience!",location
Ryan's unit was perfect for a getaway weekend in Topanga/Malibu. It was clean and lovely place to unwind at after a long day out at the beach. Ryan was very accommodating of our stay and communicative if needed during our time. Would recommend and stay again!,clean
"Quiet, friendly neighbors and easy access to the highway, beach and everything under the sun. The hosts do not bother you unless they have to do itâs your place essentially until you leave. They even leave thoughtful things like plastic cups, water and a coffee maker. The iron was not functioning and a new one was provided right away. I plan to stay here when in town.",location
"Very nice apt. Clean and great location by LAX. My sister, niece and  myself had a wonderful time. We were very happy with our stay.",clean
The location was good for our trip - walking distance to grocery store and neighborhood felt safe and was quiet.  K was spot on with instructions and super speedy with responses and helpful tips.,location
"Amazing stay worth the price and near everything fun, Iâm from the area so visiting for the weekend was like returning home would recommend 10/10 place to stay",location
"Loved staying in this place- it was within driving distance to all the spots we were trying to visit on our trip and had everything we needed! We were able to cook some meals no problem, watch movies on the TV and the air conditioning was a god send since it was hot outside during our stay. The parking spot also came in a lot of handy for us since we needed a place to keep the car overnight. The hosts also were very prompt in their replies to our questions and were very helpful whenever we needed something! Overall, I definitely enjoyed staying here and would go back again!",location
Kâs place was great! Loved the comfy couch.,location
"The apartment is clean and central for getting to the beach or downtown LA. Quiet area but accessible to freeways, restaurants and shopping. K is very responsive and easy going. Highly recommended!",clean
This was hands down the best vacation ever!!  Kelley's apartment was perfect for our family and the location was beautiful.  Neighbors were super friendly. We had everything we needed and Kelley was available if we had any questions. Super easy check in/out. It was amazing!! We are already planning our return,location
"This was our first long term stay of one month, so we had a few questions prior to arrival that received quick responses. The unit is upstairs and with the bay on one side and ocean a few blocks away, the breeze is heavenly. Everything was in working order with plenty of kitchen utensils, towels and beach chairs. There are two neighbors that live in the building that are friendly and helpful. We felt very welcome. We enjoyed 2nd Street, Shoreline Village, Pacific Aquarium, Seal Beach, numerous Farmer's Markets and a lot of fun, free activities put on by the Port of Long Beach ALL via bicycle. In one month, we put a whopping 32 miles on the car. Parking spot is a plus! Thank you Kelley, for a wonderful time at your home.",location
"Location is great, walking distance to beach and town. <br/>It is a nice house, but could use some minor touchups",location
"Location, location!! Great place with lots of amenities. Bay, beach, bikes, walking distance to everything! Can't wait to stay there again! Kelley was very responsive with any questions! Excellent host!",location
"The location was ideal.  Kelley communicated very well before and during our stay.  Upon my arrival, the fresh pastries and fruit, was a nice personal touch.",clean
"Great location across the street of Alamitos Bay Beach. The appartement was perfect, quiet neighborhood. Close to the 2nd street with nice restaurant and bar. For sure we recommand the place and love to be back one day.",location
"I lived in Belmont Shore for years back in the '60's and have had it on my bucket list to return for an extended visit just to reminisce. This visit has been a dream come true. Kelly is a sweetheart and has made it so was for me to be comfortable in this lovely place which literally 15 paces to the sand on the beach of Alamitos Bay. The apartment is outfitted with all the amenities of home...sheets, towels, pots and pans and even snacks. Great bed. Two comfortable couches. Cable TV. Quiet at night. Parking place provided for my SUV and bicycles included in the deal. I love it and will return.",location
"The apartment was really great, the location is breathtaking!!<br/>You can walk to 2nd street with all it's   bars and pubs and also to two beaches!!<br/>Would recommend and maybe even stay if I can come back!<br/>Alex from downstairs is a great guy and really funny :D",location
"Kelley's place is perfect for a family vacation! It had room for my family (4 of us) to stay while we were vacationing over Thanksgiving. The location on the beach was perfect and we were super close to 2nd street, which has all the shops and restaurants! We did have a few problems with cleanliness upon arrival (the kitchen dishes were slightly dirty and the apartment smelled a bit of cigarette smoke), however after a bit of cleaning and some candles, all was well again! We enjoyed our stay and would likely book again! Kelley is also very responsive to messages, if she is needed. Neighbors are also very friendly and responsive if help if needed! Recommended! ",location
Kelly is a wonderful host. We had a wonderful experience. She was extremely responsive each time we contact her regarding any issue we encountered. The location was amazing. This apartment is walking distance from 2nd Street where you can find a variety of shops and amazing restaurants. The beach is also only a few blocks away. The Los Alamitos Bay is right across the street. I definitely recommend Kelly's place to anyone. We were very comfortable and had everything we needed during our stay. Thank you Kelly for a wonderful experience. ,location
"Loved the view, loved the neighborhood, loved the colors of this home and private parking lot made our love stronger:) Thank you, Kelly. ",location
"The apt is in an excellent location and Alex and Mary,the downstairs neighbors are wonderful people. The space was very nice but it wasn't as clean as we expected. We enjoyed Blemomt Shore very much and nearby 2nd street is lovely. ",clean
clean.  big space.  air conditioning was great along w the gas stove and fridge.  kitchen is a nice space.  great couches.,clean
Good place but the neighborhood was a bit loud,location
Very Convenient location. Check in process was intuitive. Highly recommend.,location
This is one of my favorite places on Airbnb itâs very cozy and the location is very convenient never too far from all the places I want to go! Host is very responsive and I was able to check in early which is one of my favorite things to do. Place was clean and neat! I had a great time!,clean
"K's place is nice. Although there was a situation in the carport before we arrived, it didn't really affect our stay. the couch is really awesome. But i expected a better curtain in the place. we did really enjoy our trip in LA.",location

Great host,clean
Great place and in the perfect location if youâre getting around LA. I would definitely book again,location
Super comfortable bed! Beautiful cozy home.,location
If youâre on a budget and want a clean and comfortable place to spend the night. Kâs place is it. The bed is literally the most comfortable Iâve spent the night in. Iâm the morning thereâs lots of natural light. The apartment is also centrally located very close to the highway but surprisingly it was very quiet and you couldnât hear the traffic outside. Keurig machine and K-pods and creamer were provided for us and thereâs a fully functioning kitchen which is awesome. I get allergies very quickly and Iâm sensitive to dust especially in places where the quilt wasnât recently washed or the carpets werenât cleaned properly but I didnât get allergies a single day when I stayed over which is probably a sign that the apartment is well cleaned. When I stripped down the sheets before we left to help in clean up even the mattress protector was sparkling white and looked new. Definitely recommend it. The only negative would be that the light in the bedroom is very dim during nighttime and if youâre checking in at night have your phone light on because the light switch is not next to the entrance.,clean
Great place to stay in LA.<br/>Has everything you need for a low price.,location
Book here now! This is a trillion star stay! They are wonderful and it a very comfortable stay! Enjoy!,location
The place is great and in a good area to get around!,location
This is a very comfortable & homey place.  It feels like home away from home.  You are able to cook meals if you like.<br/><br/>Communication is very quick & the house instructions are easy to follow.<br/><br/>We will definitely try to stay the next time we come to LA to visit family.,location
Hands down one of the most comfortable and best air bnbâs I have stayed at for the value,clean
"Place is extremely clean, gorgeous location in the hills, and Ryan went above and beyond to make the stay convenient and comfortable.",clean
"Ryan was an excellent host. The unit was exactly as described, clean and very pleasant. The neighborhood is super quiet. You are really up in the hills, so very steep roads and fun to drive. Less fun going uphill on a bicycle, but I did it. You are 15 minutes or less from the beach and all I can say is I highly recommend this place and the excellent host.",clean
"This gorgeous drive to this wonderful hideaway was the icing on the cake for my trip. This private nook was extremely clean, with some basic but plentiful amenities. They even offered a beach towel. The bed was super cozy, and the private patio at night added more tranquility to the space. Ryan was welcoming and had positive communication all while giving you the retreat experience. Topanga State Park is about a 5-minute scenic drive and Tuna Canyon Park is about 12 minutes away. If you just want to get to the beach, do yourself a favor and take Tuna Canyon Road down to the Pacific, it's breathtaking.",clean
My husband and I had a nice time staying at Ryanâs. He greeted us when we arrived and made himself available for anything we needed. The place is perfect for a couple people and was overall clean and comfortable. It doesnât have good cell service but has good wifi. Itâs a great place to stay if you wanna get away from the crowded cities but still be super close to the beach.,clean
"10/10 recommend this air bnb for anyone looking to stay in the Malibu area (and itâs only 20 minute drive to Santa Monica!). The place was clean, check in and out was easy, and ryan quickly responded to any questions I had. I interacted with him twice on the property and he was so kind and made me feel at home! I will definitely be staying here again, and have already recommended it to friends in LA for when their family comes in from out of town.",clean
"Roomy and spacious apartment for the two of us.  Excellent location -- across the street from the beach on the bay and a short walk to the ocean.  Close to a multitude of shops and restaurants on 2nd Street.  Kelley and Barry were great hosts!  Welcomed us when we arrived, left fresh breakfast items for our stay, and were very responsive to our needs.  Especially enjoyed use of the bikes!",location
"Amazing stay!  The location is perfect with a very high walkability rating. Great places to eat and things to do. The water is right outside the front door.  Very clean space and cute beach-life decor.  Loved the private patio area for sunbathing. <br/><br/>My girlfriend stayed at home while I was at work during the day and she had a wonderful time walking along the beach and taking in the lovely beach town neighborhood. <br/><br/>Kelley was very responsive with recommendations and stopped by to drop off some supplies at the doorstep. The neighbor Alex was very cool, offered up the BBQ if we wanted to relax on the front porch and watch the people sail by. Couldn't ask for more from a stay. <br/><br/>Movie theater and a Trader Joe's within five minutes of the place. Otherwise, you could park your car in the back and forget you brought it.  <br/><br/>Thanks so much, Kelley.  Hope to stay again in the future. ",location
Neat neighborhood! Host communicated well beforehand. Loved my long morning walks and bike ride along the beach!,location
"The location of Kelley's place is outstanding, specially for the rate. It is literally on the bay. Additionally, it is the best location in Belmont Shore if, like in my case, there is a need to have quick access to the 605 fwy because there is no 2nd street traffic (main street). Yet, it is walking distance to everything. Kelley was a very kind and thoughtful host. She was prompt to communicate for check-in and check-out. I did not expect her to have her son drop off snacks, fruit, and juice for breakfast. I was very pleasantly surprised to see that the private deck mentioned in the listing is actually a fully private patio with nice chairs and bbq exclusively for the unit. There was nothing I needed that I did not find in the unit. Kelley even had good quality toiletries available. The unit can be a little stuffy because of the weather and its proximity to the beach. However, Kelley has done a very good job at having very good ceiling fans with remote control in every room, which helped to keep things ventilated and pleasant. One of the best things was having the off-street parking, which is very, very rare in this area. I will definitely look forward to staying at Kelley's place again.  ",location
"Although I never met Kelly I did meet her very nice husband and their neighbors who were very accommodating! They left us a small amount of breakfast items that lasted us through our stay and Alex their downstairs neighbor offered us use of their bikes! Not to mention the view and vibes of Belmont Shore were superb, we also lucked out with sun and weather! All in all an amazing place with amazing people! Thanks!",location
Had a great time staying on Bayshore. Kelley's place was clean and well maintained. The neighbors are great. Will stay again.,clean
"The location provides easy access to beach, bay (across the street), a variety of restaurants, kayaking, paddle boarding, and is superb for cycling and exploring on foot. Shoreline Village (about 4.5 miles away - 20-25 minute bike ride along the beach or 10 minute Uber trip) and Ballast Point Brewery (on the other side of Naples Island, and another quick and easy Uber trip) are really fun destinations and highly recommended! Included parking behind the property is convenient  and very helpful because the area is popular with beach goers. The apartment itself is comfortable but somewhat dated. For the location, it is a very good value. ",location
"Kelley's place is just perfect. The location is unbeatable, the neighbourhood is quiet and safe. The apartment is well equipped and the bed in the master bedroom is very comfortable. We stayed with our two kids (11 & 14) and both of them slept on the pullout couch without any problems. The breakfast items were a surprise and much appreciated. There are two bbq on the deck (a small weber charcoal and a propane bbq) which we loved to use for making dinners. We never met Kelley in person, but she checked in with us via email. This is a place where I could see myself staying during the rainy winters on the West Coast of Canada. We will be back next year!",location
Location is perfect for the beach and strolling 2nd Street.  All the basics were provided as well as some breakfast items.  We found it to be quiet at night which I wasn't expecting since some other streets in Belmont Shore can get noisy with late night passerby's.  Great little place and a fantastic location in the Shore!,location
"Great place, loved the bay and beach right acrossed the street.  Great neighborhood for walking and so close to 2nd Steet and all the great restaurants. Looking forward to staying there again. ",location
"Lovely location surrounded by nature, and interesting architecture. Everything about the space provided all that we needed to have a comfortable, and relaxing experience.",location
"Had a great stay at Ryanâs. Felt like we had our own apartment away from the main house, super cozy and so much space and the AC was amazing! Location isnât too far from the beach as well",location
"Great spot in canyon canopy. Cool spot, fab art.",location
My bestie and I had a lovely time staying at Ryanâs Airbnb! Warning to get to the spot it does have a lot of twists and turns and the road is narrow but he provides great instructions!! Itâs a getaway tucked away in the hills and you arenât far from the city even though it feels like it :) Clean and cozy!,clean
Relaxing and comfortable place to stay. Ryan was very communicative and easy to work with. Iâll be back next time Iâm in the area!,location
"Loved our stay! Ryan was extremely friendly & easy to communicate with. The location is also great, as it is within a reasonable driving distance from anything you could want/need. Looked  just like the pictures & was very clean with modern features. The trip went completely smooth. Definitely recommend for anyone whoâs looking for a weekend getaway! Couldnât be more pleased. (:",clean
"This is a cozy space with everything we needed to base ourselves for our planned activities. Ryan is a friendly host, great communicator, and went out of his way to be sure we had everything we needed. Actually, he went above and beyond when city workers caused some limitations in the area. His favorite hikes turned out to be ours as well - beautiful views and a variety of trails. The windy roads up the canyon to his house seemed challenging at first but we grew familiar with them and enjoyed exploring the area. We felt welcomed and would choose this space again if we get back this way.",location
Great spot for a relaxing stay in Topanga.  Very easy to get to Malibu and tons to enjoy nearby.  Ryan was a great host.,location
Place is sick way better than the pictures! An Ryan is a super cool dude too!,location
Ryan went above and beyond to accommodate our every need. We visited during a cold spell and Ryan was extremely attentive to ensure we stayed cozy and warm despite the freezing temperatures. Really enjoyed our stay and would strongly recommend!,clean
Great place to relax and stay around Malibu area,location
"Ryan is a great host and his place is super private and has everything youâll need for a comfortable stay. The area is beautiful and we loved his hike recommendation, would definitely stay again",location
"Nice area, cozy space, and it was stocked with all the amenities we needed and then some.",clean
"I have never been more disappointed of an Airbnb. This place was dirty. There were hairs all in the bathroom, dust over the blinds, rodent sounds coming from the walls, etc. Also, the unit was hard to find as there is no clear indication to where itâs located. Another reviewer left a great hint, if you are traveling there in the dark be cautious. This airbnb is located deep within a canyon on a narrow windy path. It is pitch black driving there so drive with caution. Finally, the host did not respond when we asked for clarification on directions, and we were not checked on until literally the moment we were leaving our stayâ¦by coincidence of seeing him enter his home.",clean
Ryan was a great host! Very friendly and hospitable. The place was also nice and very clean.,clean
"This is a great spot to be in if youâre looking to be close to the beach! We split our time in between Santa Monica and Malibu. The place was great, very cozy, and Ryan is a great host who is very communicative and helpful. The drive up the mountain was a little intimidating, but we got used to it. Thanks again for a great stay!",location
We loved our stay here! Place was clean and cozy. Host was awesome & communicative. Would love to come stay again!,clean
We enjoyed our stay at Ryanâs. Everything was very clean and had all we need. Ryan was very helpful.,clean

"Honestly, if this place was for sale and I were to move to LA I would try to convince Matthew to sell it to me. It is the perfect location in West Hollywood, not in the midst of all the madness but still close enough to some of the best spots (among which breakfast at Salt's Cure). Free parking in front of the streets (if you read parking signs well) is also very convenient.<br/><br/>Matthew has also designed the apartment in a very efficient and convenient way and everything one would need was there when I arrived. The place also looks exactly as it does in the pictures.<br/>Finally, Matthew was very communicative and helpful. If there was every a minor issue he or Ronny would immediately rush to the house.<br/><br/>Recommend it highly!",location
"I contacted Matthew while I was in Los Angele because I needed to move from where I was staying. He was quite communicative and very helpful. The apartment was exactly as advertised: it was clean, comfortable and extremely well set-up. Matthew provided all the niceties--soap, shampoo, etc.--as well as some coffee in the kitchen. The kitchen was well set-up, which was great for me as I like to cook. The neighborhood is great--between Santa Monica and Melrose, both of which have a number of restaurants, bars and shops. All in all, a very good experience. ",clean
"Matthew's place was great! Very clean, trendy, and adorable! It was also in an amazing location! We had a great time and I would definitely recommend Matthew's place to anyone!! ",clean
"Located in a great area that was so close to everything! It was a quiet neighbourhood and the people were friendly.<br/>It had everything we needed and was lovely, clean and organised leaving us with nothing to worry about or to clean up.<br/>Matthew was very easy to communicate with and replied quickly.<br/>We really enjoyed our stay and would 100% recommend staying here.",clean
"The apartment was appointed as necessary to allow for comfort--clean towels, bedding, dishes and other cookware. I wouldn't call it well designed, just basically appointed from IKEA to allow for convenience. Not something that was terribly an issue, but something to note after reading through other reviews. Parking is very difficult around the apartment, maybe more so than in the past as I read other reviews, due to construction workers taking up most of the available parking spots throughout the neighborhood. Internet isn't incredibly reliable if you are trying to work from the apartment on a regular basis. <br/><br/>There were a few number of issues that needed to be resolved prior to my arrival that were not cared for that would have made the stay more comfortable--a leak under the kitchen sink, seals for the doors to prevent unwanted house guests, spraying for unwanted house guests, making sure the television was hooked up properly to be used (something I never figured out while I was there) and a few other issues. The property handyman was very helpful in addressing issues as necessary throughout my stay, which was much appreciated. <br/><br/>I wouldn't call this a bad place to stay, but I would have liked my expectations managed a little better prior to booking. Overall, I found myself comfortable here for an extended stay, which can be a challenge in any place that isn't your own for five weeks. That has to count for a lot amidst any problems that were rather well addressed.",clean
"My friends and I enjoyed our stay in this apartment. It's in a great location with tons of amazing shops and restaurants, and not a far drive from other good areas. I highly recommend this apartment especially if it's your first time in LA.  Thanks for your hospitality Michael:)",location
"Matthews' cute bungalow on North Martel avenue is such a charm in West Hollywood!  It is in the middle of pure residential area where you just feel staying your own neighborhood back home.<br/><br/>Tasteful interior decoration and thoughtful installments in kitchen and bathroom.  You will just fall in love with this place as soon as you walk in!<br/><br/>Perfect location: walking distance to Melrose avenue; close to sunset blvd, west 3 rd streets, half way to Korean town, half way to UCLA, and not far to LAX!<br/><br/>If you want to have exciting LA's fun at the same time having feeling like being home, I highly recommend Matthews's charming bungalow.  I really had good time and looking forward to staying in his place again!",location

Kelley's place in Long Beach is a gem. Close to shopping dining and the beaches you never even have to get into your car. That said it's off street parking private.  The place was very comfortable clean and a great location. Nice deck off the kitchen. Kelley left breakfast items such as coffee cake and yogurt. We had a blast staying here and would definitely stay here again across the street is the beach.  I look forward to being able to go back.,clean
"We love the location, it's super casual, fun, lots of great restaurants, not to mention all the outdoor and water activities you can do - all within walkable distance.  The place is very simple yet it has everything you need but if you are expecting luxury, contemporary or upscale, this is not the place for you.  On Friday nights and weekends, the neighborhood is hopping, lots of people, cars, music, so cool and fun.  Our neighbor downstairs Alex & Maria are awesome, they are super friendly and nice.  If you love a good variety of IPAs' and good casual dining - definitely walk to Simmzy's on 2nd Street.  We were there almost every night and sat at the bar, wonderful service and we LOVED IT.<br/><br/>Kelley was very responsive to our questions and needs.  We'll definitely be back.<br/><br/>Janet & Kurt",location
Perfect apartment for one or two people - very charming - ample closet space to hang clothes etc.  <br/><br/>Extremely quiet.<br/><br/>Super location - just couple of blocks north of Melrose.  Street parking easy to find.,location
"Once again, Matthew did a great job of hosting and keeping in contact. I had to make an emergency business trip and he was able to facilitate my needs within a couple hours. This was a great relief knowing I had a place to stay in LA. I even had a question and he responded that evening via text.<br/>Thanks Matthew!",host
I had a great stay at Matthew's place. I was there for a month and barely encountered any problem. The apartment is beautifully designed and has everything you could need. The neighborhood is tranquil yet centrally located. Matthew was very reachable whenever I needed something. Overall had a very pleasant stay. ,location

Great stay! Perfect location and had everything we needed for a short visit. ,location

"This nice comfortable little bungalow is a perfect little home while in LA. They nailed all of the amenities. Clean linens, soaps, and odds and ends in the kitchen. We were also walking distance to a great part of Melrose and all of the shopping and places to eat that come with it. I highly recommend this one. ",clean
This apartment is in a great location just off Melrose avenue and is equipped with everything needed for a stay in LA. It's decorated really nicely and very clean. I would definitely stay again. Easy communication with Matthew as well.,clean
"Amazing experience. Great location. Very close to Melrose and everything great that Melrose offers. Place was very clean and designed well. There were some coronas in the fridge that were nice to have after a long day. There's heat and AC which both came in handy! Also, Mathew writes back right away! That's always huge. A++++ all around.

Great experience. Very clean and was as pictured. Mathew was responsive and helpful. Would recommend. ,clean
"Great experience overall! Phenomenal location in west Hollywood ( safe area, close to everything, quiet) and the place was exactly as pictured--- and as well it was very clean and comfortable ( with all the amenities of home). Wonderful stay, similar to a hotel experience-- and half the price for the area! <br/><br/>Needed to drop bags early, and Matthew was more than accommodating and friendly which was a welcome after our long flight. We did have a minor hiccup with receiving the Key ( lockbox was changed last minute and we had not been updated with it at our checkin time). However, the maintenance guy was walking around near check-in time making sure everyone got in okay and helped us out (which was an amazing perk)! <br/><br/>Matthew was also very friendly and available via text-- felt well taken care of. <br/><br/>Would highly recommend!  ",clean
"Clean, as advertised, and overall an easy process. Good communication. ",clean
"This was a business trip which went longer than usual so I got into Airbnb. As a first time user, it couldn't get any better than I'd hoped for. Very lucky to  get into this place, it surely did match its posting from friendliness to clean quiet hood. Will definitely choose this again for future trips! Just one little downside, would be nice to have cable tv and a stronger wifi, otherwise all tip top good!",clean
This location was perfect for my daughter's stay in West Hollywood. Close to great restaurants and shopping. The street was quiet and safe. The studio was perfect in size and very clean. Thank you Matt for being so helpful!,location
"This is the second time I have stayed here and I will stay here again in the future. Matthew is always a great host and the apartment is in a clean, friendly part of town. It's a 3 minute walk to Melrose and a quick Uber ride to WeHo's bars or Hollywood Blvd. Matthew has always been contactable every time I've visited and the apartment has all the amenities one needs for a comfortable stay. No complaints. It's a great little spot. ",location
"The location was perfect, it was close to everything. The apartment was clean and looked exactly like the images posted. We stayed for 4 weeks and never had a single problem. Would highly recommend staying here!",clean

I  was having trouble with the apartment's internet connection, and though finding a solution was not easy, Matthew very diligently worked on the issue until it was resolved. Checking in and out was quick and easy. The apartment was comfortable and had a lot of good amenities. Overall, I had a good experience and I think this apartment is a great choice for people interested in visiting that part of LA.",clean
Very cozy place with fresh energy and perfect location,location
"The location was perfect,itâs a beautiful and safe neighborhood.the apartment was clean and cozy,just like the images posted.highly recommend this apartment.",clean
"The location is excellent, and having access to a stove is pretty great for a place this size. Parking is pretty typical city parking, so it's not super fun, but 9 times out of 10 you'll find a spot within a block.<br/><br/>Make of this what you will, but it is a little hands off, and very much feels like you're just subletting your own place. I had to run out and replace the shower rod which randomly busted one day. I didn't mind that, and it's not like the place is falling apart, but it's worth keeping in mind that you're on your own to some degree as part of this rental, which may not be the case with others.",clean
The location of this is fantastic. Very short walk to Melrose with lots of restaurants and shopping. It is where the action is and yet it was on a side street so it was quiet. As a fan of taking baths this also was such an old funky building it had a bath tub and shower which blew my mind. So I love that about it and there was plenty of hot water when I took my bath at night and nearby my son and His two week old twins which made it perfect.,location
Great spot! Tons of stuff to do nearby.,location
"Ryan was a great and attentive host. Very fast and easy communication, and check in/out was a breeze. We loved staying in Topanga and will definitely recommend Ryanâs place to friends (and hopefully be back ourselves, too!) The space was stocked with all the essentials, and more. Thank you Ryan!",clean
"Easy access to Bay and ocean. Many shops, restaurants and cafes within a 5-10 minute walk. Plenty of space for 4. Not family friendly. Neighbors complained when children were playing... even though we spent very little time there. ",location
"This place is fabulous. A swim area just steps away, a bike trail all along the beach for miles (just a block away) - Kelley loans you bikes and a short walk to 'town' with so many restaurants and shops. The apartment is clean, beds are very comfy, well stocked with linens and kitchen supplies AND there is a private back patio. There were 3 of us and plenty of room for a 4th. We hope to come back and stay longer. Thanks Kelley.",location
"My kids 6 years old and 20 months, and us loved staying at Kelley's house! Every day off to the beach in the morning and in the afternoon to the public library at the corner, or the Aquarium of the pacific. There were so many food and Ice Cream places near by and just the beach view was wonderful. The neighbors we very nice to all of us! Really nice people. They gave us good tips for places and transportation, kept our stroller so we didn't have to take it upstairs, nice to talk to, just very nice people!",location
"Loved our stay at Kelley's place. Very clean, comfortable, excellent location, and lots of extra ammeneties.  We will definetly stay here again when returning to Long Beach.",clean
"The house had a lovely view of the beach right across the street and was in a very convenient location close to 2nd street, making it easy to take a stroll on the beach and explore the shops after dinner. The deck outside behind the house was a very nice place to have dinner as well. Overall, the house was very neat and a pleasant place to stay and relax. ",location

"Wow what an amazing place. Litteraly steps away from water.  Clean, spacious apartment, loved the neightboor. We could not have asked for a better place. Would definitely stay there again.<br/>",clean
Kelley was a fantastic host with great communication. The apartment was clean and just what we were looking for in regards to a beach place. It truly felt like home while we were there. We had our 2 girls ages 3 and 5 with us and we loved the easy beach access and having a lot of restaurants/shops in walking distance. The neighbors that live downstairs were very helpful with suggestions of things to do in the area and offered us use of their beach umbrella and tube. Overall it was a fantastic experience and we will definitely rent from Kelley again if we are back in the area.,clean
"Loved the proximity to the bay beach (across the street and visible from the front door) and the host Kelly!<br/><br/>Some heads-up for future guests (I do not at all hold these things against the host): the alley and parking space are a tight squeeze as you would expect alleyway parking to be, so if you must rent, try to rent a compact car; Bay Shore Avenue is closed from 9-5 and that plus the adjacent one-way streets make the direction of your exit/entry to parking really matter; the wifi is an adequate speed and reaches the whole apartment but sometimes drags to a crawl for a minute before recovering, so be patient and ready to reset your connection to the router if it stalls for too long.<br/><br/>Bring beach towels and a book; it's wonderful to spend all day right in front of the apartment on the bay!",location
"Our family of four had a wonderful stay here! The place was clean, provided all the essentials needed and is in a great location! We walked to Second Street for shopping and dinner, the public park, and the beach. Great central location! Beds were comfortable, and the back patio was a great hangout spot in the morning and evenings. Thanks for everything!",clean

"This place is in a fantastic location, I found myself able to walk to Melrose Ave. (which has many restaurants & shopping) in 5 minutes. I would definitely stay again if need be. The only downside was that there was mantenience a few times during our stay, it wasn't anything terrible because we were there for an entire month. The kitchen was also filled with anything and everything you would need to cook from spices to pots and pans! Thanks for the great stay!",location

"The home was in a great location and it was a big plus to have off street parking. There is a little jungle gym for the kids but I recommend playing ANYWHERE else, it's not the most stable. There were dust bunnies everywhere!!!!. Overall it was a nice home but it definitely should have been clean before we arrived.",clean
Kelley's place was clean and really cute.  We loved being within walking distance of both the beach and shops and restaurants.  There were plenty of towels for the beach and a couple beach chairs too.    Really nice place.,clean

This is right on the bay and near kayak and SUP rentals.  It's great for all ages.,location
"One of my fav air bnb's.  Kelley left us breakfast, quickly responded to any questions we had and was flexible with checkout time.<br/>Despite being a back apartment, the beach is literally across the street.  Had great fun kayaking & paddleboarding in same area!<br/>We'll be back!",clean
"We love love Belmont Shore.  Awesome restaurants choices, lively and fun neighborhood, plus super cool neighbors and Kelley is a great host.  We'll be back for sure.",location
"This was our first trip to California and first time in an Airbnb. Ryan did a great job communicating with me prior to the trip. His place was clean and well kept. <br/><br/>The only negatives are if you have a larger vehicle then the skinny road to his place will be tough to navigate. And if you're picky about beds this one was a bit hard and smallish for a couple. <br/><br/>However, my wife and I would definitely stay there again.",clean

"Kelley's place was awesome! It is right across from the bay and so close to the oceanside beach (about two blocks). It is also very convenient to lots of restaurants and activities so you don't need a car to get around. The apartment was spotless and had everything you could need for a stay- including towels, breakfast items, sunscreen, etc.. Kelley was very easy to get in touch with.

This space is perfect for a quiet stay in Malibu! Ryan is an awesome host and we had all the accommodations needed for a comfortable trip. Would book again!,space

So close to the ocean, to the inlet with a beach, to a massive array of eateries, to major box stores such as CVS, groceries, Best Buy, etc.  We plan to visit Long Beach from the eastern US twice yearly until we buy property there, and Kelley's will be our place.",clean
"Ryanâs place is awesome. A perfectly quaint studio with a private patio area overlooking the woodsy scenery. Perfect for coffee in the morning or cocktails at night.

"A friend and I enjoyed our long weekend in Belmont Shore. Kelley was easy to communicate with and quickly responded to questions we had. We appreciated the breakfast items she left and how clean the place was. Loved riding the bikes, the close proximity to Second Street, and being right across from the beach. My friend said the bed was very comfortable. I slept on the pullout bed which would be my only complaint, as it was not very comfortable. Great place and great host!",clean

Kelley is a very attentive host and the place is really nice. Location is amazing right next to the beach and a few blocks from shops and restaurants. We weren't looking for a big place because we knew we were going to spend most of our time out and about but if that's not the case for you maybe it's a little small. We had an awesome week here â¤ï¸,location

Kelleyâs place in Belmont Shore is a very nice apartment. It is clean and quiet in a superb location on the beach and close to all the restaurants on second street. It was very easy to check in and out and Kelley got back to us quickly on any questions. An added benefit in this area is off-street parking! I highly recommend this unit!,location

"Location is fabulous &, generally, everything was perfect. We hope to stay there whenever we return to the area.",location
"Ryan's place is very nice! My husband and I enjoyed our stay. The privacy can't be beat. Feels more like a detached cottage than a basement setup. The drive up is a little scary at night, just be prepared. Very close to Malibu and Santa Monica. We enjoyed both cities in the 2 nights we stayed here!",location
"We had a great time at Ryan's place. Great proximity to Malibu and LA for the price. The place was clean and comfortable with all of the amenities we needed for our stay. The drive to the location is beautiful. It was not difficult but the road up the mountain to Ryan's place is steep and narrow, so something to be prepared for. Overall we had a wonderful stay.",clean
"Loved our weekend stay. Came into town for work and this place had everything we needed. Appreciated the sunscreen + towels for the beach!  It is a curvy road up the mountain so make sure you are comfortable with the drive, I had my partner do it because I was nervous. Great stay and would stay again. Loved the few restaurants a short drive away. Some other reviews said you could walk to it but it looked dangerous along the road so plan to drive to the little town! But just a 5 minute max drive away.",location

"Polen was very accommodating for our late arrival time.  She also quickly answered any questions I had before we arrived.<br/>There was no hair dryer or toaster and they were both provided almost immediately.  <br/>It seemed unclear by the listing that there were actually 3 condos that shared the garden.  That didn't end up being a problem because the people in the other two condos were very nice, but it should be made more clear.  <br/>The beds were very comfortable, although the futon was too firm.  <br/>The bathroom was very nice, but small.  <br/>There was a washer and dryer available, which was extremely helpful because we stayed a week.",location
"Very nice location. Our family of 4 stayed there and the kids loved it. Kelly is very thoughtful, left us some breakfast food to enough. The apartment is a bit dated and has a partial view to the ocean so don't expect full view. Overall it's a nice place for a small family.",location
"This was our first time using Air BnB and it did not disappoint. The house was easy to get to with ample parking, and in a safe area.

This the perfect place for a family getaway or staying in LBC for business. Belmont and 2nd street have excellent restaurants and great for outdoor activities. Kelley is an amazing host who took great care to ensure everything was perfect during our stay.,location
Everything was perfect but I wished I had the balcony like the apartment next to us.  Sitting outside on a balcony enjoying the view would have made this nicer.  We had to take the beach chairs and go across the street on the sand for this!,location

The only thing to note is that the bedroom and living room are actually connected and you can hear one from the other, but that didnât disturb our 1 year old!",clean
"We enjoyed staying here and can not wait to plan our next trip back. Everything was wonderful. There are some things you just canât capture in pictures, so come and see for yourself. We truly enjoyed the amenities, location, cleanliness and hospitality. This Airbnb is a gem and so is the host!",clean
Great location-walk/bike or jog to everything.  Close proximity to bike/jogging path along the beach.  There is a beautiful outdoor swimming pool open to public in Belmont Shores that they keep at 80 degrees.  The walking distance shops and restaurants on 2nd Ave were great!  Unit was very clean with lots of breakfast goodies.  I am also a host and would recommend Kelley's place.,clean

Just a short walk across a small road to the beach and water! Great location for walking to dinner and stores. Kelley has all the things you need for a great stay (including beach gear!). Her place was clean and comfy. ,location
"Kelly's place couldn't have been more perfectly placed. The Bay isn't somewhere I have been before but is a place I will come back to over and over! We didn't have our kids this trip, but will certainly be coming back with them! Location gets a 5 star, over and over! Literally across the street to the sand, half a block to 2nd street, where we had all of our meals over 4 days, and did tons of shopping! The Rite Aid being there was super helpful as well! <br/>We utilized the bikes a few times, which was super nice to have and not have to rent! We also rented a canoe one morning, and it was amazing to be steps away to the house for a shower when we were done!<br/><br/>One of the older houses in the best locations, so, I'll take it! She is priced appropriately! We didn't need a car! (But there is parking) Uber and enjoy the location!! If you can, fly to/from Long Beach, LAX traffic was terrible when we came in at noon on a Wednesday, but when we flew back home from Long Beach, it was a breeze!<br/><br/>The breakfast items were such a sweet touch! We super appreciate the little touches like that!<br/><br/>Plenty of linens, extra towels and probably 10 beach towels! It had everything we needed! Beach toys and a boogie board on the back patio, picnic basket, kitchen appliances (we didn't use), and the washer and dryer was a huge bonus!<br/><br/>We would, and will come again.",location

"The location of this condo was fantastic.  Right by the water and close to restaurants/shops.  Kelley had the condo very nicely stocked and left breakfast items as well.  Our one complaint was the lack of A/C in the unit.  We happened to go during a heat wave and it was 90 degrees in the condo.  Once we reached out to Kelley, she got in touch with the downstairs tenant who was able to assist with a portable A/C unit.  We honestly wouldn't have stayed without that.  While we realize that 100+ degrees in that area is not the norm, there should be some sort of air system available.<br/><br/>",location
"This place had practically everything I could ask for in a long-term stay. Plenty of cookware, two wifi networks, cable TV, bikes with helmets in the garage, washer and dryer, lots of space. The driveway did easily accommodate two cars, so if youâre stepping out at random times of the night or day, pay attention or youâll almost bump into one lol. I opted to park on the side streetsâplenty of space! The beach is only a short walk away. Lots of good food nearby. Quiet neighborhood, except for a fire engine every now and then. <br/><br/>Pro-tip: Reverse in if you do use the driveway for a car. The street can be busy at times.",location

"The location is great. Close to all the restaurants, icecream and Rit Aid (just a block away). I love how we are so close to the beach, they block off the road everyday 9-5 so super safe for the kids cross the road to the beach. Kelley is very thoughtful that prepared breakfast items and beach toys and chairs. My kids love the body boards! The beach is great you can go kayaking for $10 per hour per person. The city have a public water trampoline it was so much fun. The sofa bed wasnât very comfortable to adult imo but my 2 little boys were not complaining at all. We had such a great time for the last 2 weeks. Thank you! We will definitely come back.",location
"The stay here was amazing! The location for for the price was incredible!! You are literally steps away from the sand... itâs a great beach for the kiddos as there are no big waves, but if you like a bigger beach with bigger waves that is just a short WALK away too. 2nd st was an enjoyable experience for us, ice cream, restaurants, COFFEE, and Rite-aide all in walking distance. Kelley was so prompt in responding to all of our questions. The neighbors we so inviting, and friendly. Even with little ones we felt very safe. Loved having a washer and dryer, kitchen with all necessities, extra linens and beach towels, also breakfast items included. We will definitely return! ",location
"amazing location right on the bay, you can walk barefoot from the apartment to the water as the road is closed to cars  in the daytime. can walk to all bars and restaurants. nice touch by the host to leave cake and coffee.  apartment is basic but very clean and has everything you need. very easy to relax here. ",location
"Location, location, location! If you want to be by the bay, this is the place! This bay is very mellow and the perfect place to enjoy the sun and water for the day. This place is also close to fun restaurants and shops near Belmont shores.",location
"If you are traveling to LA and want to be centrally located for all of the fabulous beaches in the area, Kelleyâs place is the way to go!",location
"This is our second stay in the past 6 months, so that should speak enough for itself. <br/><br/>The only difference is this time, we brought our 4 young children along! <br/><br/>The home was almost exactly the same as when we stayed a couple months back, but there were some minor changes, since we used things we hadn't before.<br/><br/>The hide a bed had a big foam topper on it but as an adult, I wouldn't want to sleep on it. The kids had no complaints and thought it was cool. <br/><br/>Though there were enough sheets and blankets for what we needed in the closet, there was not a designated linen set for the pull out bed. <br/><br/>Because my kids are young, I worried about safety without having a tall door latch on the front door for the stairs/ocean/street, and without cleaning cabinets having a latch or lock, but if your kids are older, this shouldn't be a concern.<br/>A baby gate would be a great addition! I would bring my own next time for sure!<br/><br/>There is a pack and play and a booster seat with tray for babies/toddlers. It was very nice to not have to bring those things with us! I would note that the pack and play doesn't have bedding, and it is older (and larger) so your own pack & play sheet will not fit. If you need this, a normal sized crib sheet should do the trick! <br/><br/>The addition of beach chairs, beach toys and adult bikes was very nice! The less you have to bring on family vacation, the better! We brought our kids' bikes! The street is shut down from 9-5, so the kids can ride bikes and scooters without fear of cars and that was awesome!<br/><br/>There was plenty of room for our family of 6 (kids, 7 and under), both bed wise and seating in the living room, kitchen and deck. <br/><br/>The best features with having 6 people? Cleanliness, the designated parking space and washer and dryer! All are absolutely necessary and at the top of my list when booking for my family!",clean
This was a great location for our daughter. The Bayshore area was a perfect spot. The beach was just a short walk to enjoy the bigger waves.,location
This place is amazing! Great location and amenities! It was great to have bikes available to use to explore the area. And the beach is just steps away. Very comfortable for my husband and myself. Would definitely recommend and look forward to returning in the future!,location
Kelleyâs place is A++ ! Great location great space great host!!,location
"The location for this place is absolutely amazing! The two of us slept comfortably during our long weekend stay, the sleeper sofa has a nice, thick foam pad on top of it that helps alleviate the usual issues with sleeper sofas. Parking in the alley was SO convenient and really amazing during the busy hours - with the caveat that a larger vehicle might have a difficult time backing out (our large 4-door sedan did pretty well once we got the hang of it). Kelley also left us some breakfast treats, which we definitely appreciated on the busier days. Very walkable and near tons of great restaurants, as well as the quiet shore. It was nice being tucked away inside of the shore instead of out and exposed on the busy beach. Great place, wonderful for a small group!",location
"Great location! Easy wakl to beach and beach bike path and 2nd street with great restaurants and shops in Belmont Shore. Apartment is perfect for one or two people. Compact, but well appointed. Kelley's place had everything I needed for my two week work- related stay. I appreciated the breakfast items Kelley left too. Saved me a late night trip to the grocery when I first arrived. Literally right across from beach - you can't go wrong.",location
"If you are looking for a Airbnb right at the beach, this is your location. Little beach with calm sea directly in front. Bigger beach with bigger waves only a short walk away.<br/>Highly appreciate the bikes we were allowed to use.",location
We've stayed here twice -- once for 10 days and another for 17 days. It's a home away from home in a place we call paradise.  Kelley is quick to respond but you really don't have much to request because the apartment has what you need.  We'll be back!,location
"Super friendly and helpful host. The place was clean, parking was easy (no small thing), and the location was very convenient to so much. Really enjoyed our stay.",clean
This is a fantastic place in a perfect location.,location
"Polenâs house was lovely, we stayed at the 2-bedroom unit and enjoyed how comfy it was. The master bedroom was huge with plenty of space in the common areas (living, dining, kitchen). We enjoyed the patio/garden too for a bit of morning sun before we started our day. Off-street parking is a bit of a squeeze for two cars but still worked. The house is located off a main street but it was surprisingly quiet in the evenings which proved to not be a problem at all. We would definitely stay there again!",location
"Polensâs place had everything we could have asked for. Cozy clean comfortable. Location was safe and quiet. Polen was a great host super quick to respond, accommodated our early check in request no problem. Iâd recommend this place as a vacation spot and Polen as a host.",clean
Great location in an eclectic neighborhood of small shops and local owned coffee shops. The shared parking spot is plus. A 20 minute walk to Belmont Shore restaurants. Huge common space gives you plenty of area to move around. Convenient access  to Downtown Long Beach or the 405 Freeway. Sparkling clean with super responsive host.,location
"This sweet listing exceeded our expectations. The home was much more modern and cozy than we anticipated from the photos. Parking was super easy (which can be rare in some areas of Long Beach). We especially loved the back area Zen garden -- which was like a mini secluded getaway where we enjoyed our daily coffee.  It was the perfect location near cafes, food, cute neighborhood, and a short walk to the beach!<br/><br/>Polen was also an amazing host. She was extremely hospitable and accommodating. Super helpful and easy to communicate with. <br/><br/>Highly recommend!",location
"Awesome response time from host, would definitely stay here again.",clean
Polen was a very courteous host! Had a wonderful stay during my visit in Long Beach. Was very helpful and quick to respond with any questions I had! Would definitely recommend to anyone staying in Long Beach.,host
Good neighborhood . Convenient to everything . Very good host. Pretty clean place. Air was out but she got it fixed As Soon as she could . So thumbs up overall i would come back again.,clean
"I loved everything about this home. I truly will stay here again my next time in California. I will also recommend friends and my family to stay here. Super Cozy , Super Zin, Super Me !!!",location
This is a great place to stay if you find yourself in the area. Great location from just about every attraction nearby. Parking was simple and easy. Place is large and has everything you need for your stay. Makes you feel like your vacationing at home but in a different location. Would highly recommend and I know I will be staying there again when I find myself in the area again. Lovely hostess and very quick to respond and assist.,location
"A lovely place in a great location, host is charming and answered all requests promptly and was able to provide us with all we needed. Restaurant bakery and coffee shop nearby. A very nice stay.",location
"Easy check-in, great communication, and spotless! Thoroughly enjoyed my stay in such an amazing location!",clean
"This was our first Airbnb experience and Polen made everything super easy and comfortable. We had a leak in our rental apt and had to quickly vacate for 2 weeks while it was being fixed. My husband and I needed to find a location close to our apt and were lucky to find this place. Polen was super quick to respond to all my messages and answer all my questions. She met us upon arrival and gave a quick tour. The place is super spacious and the zen garden was really nice and relaxing. We werenât able to park in the driveway as itâs first come first serve, but thereâs plenty of street parking and we were always able to park right in front of the property. We also had to work during our stay and the internet was amazing and super fast (better than what we have at home). We were able to try a few new coffee shops and restaurants all within walking distance. The property is on a busy street but itâs actually pretty quiet, especially at night. We already miss our stay and Polen was such a sweet and gracious host. We definitely recommend this place and would stay here again.",location
"The Bay front location was perfect. We walked everywhere. Itâs right near the kayak and stand up paddle board rental, and 2nd Street for every kind of shopping and dining. Plus, the trails for walking, running, or biking on the ocean side are only a few blocks away. Adorable neighborhood, with the swimmable Bay across the road just outside the front door. Not fancy, but comfortable with everything you need.",location
Wonderful location and terrific hosts!  Kelley makes you feel right at home and is very quick to respond to any request or need.  We hope to return next year.,location
Polen's place was exceptional. She is a great host with quick responses. The listing was bigger than anticipated with all the amenities for short or long term stays. I would definitely recommend staying here.,location
Polen's place is in a great location! Parking was always easy and the spot is in walking distance to lots of great eateries and fun shops. Spacious and roomy and lots of spots to work remotely. WiFI connection was great!,location
Awesome host. My only problem is parking especially during night time when I get home.,clean
"This place is the perfect location around Malibu and Los Angeles. The neighborhood is beautiful, safe, and the outdoors welcomes you! Ceciliaâs place is gorgeous! Her and her daughter are so nice and caring and make it feel like home (it was mine for 4 months)! And their dog Pepper is a sweetheart. I would recommend this stay 100%. The room and bathroom are well kept, clean, and comforting!",clean
"Nice, comfortable and quiet place to stay in Agoura. The room was spacious and clean. It worked perfectly for working and visiting friends while in L.A. The hosts were hospitable and kind throughout. I would highly recommend.",clean
Wonderful person and great host.,host
"Thanks for being such a lovely host :) I fully enjoyed my stay, hope to meet you again in future.",clean
"Be mindful of the rugged steps in front. They're beautiful, but dangerous. Also there is a very sweet dog and a teenager, so loud volume on TV every night. Otherwise, very comfy cozy.",location
"Cecilia was a gracious and wonderful host. Clear, fast, great communication. Greeted with fresh supplies, towels, and a spotless room.  Was able to work from the room while also serving my accommodation needs. Definitely a good find and gracious host.",clean
"Everything was just as advertised.  Cecilia was easy to communicate and super responsive.  Their dog Pepper is sweet and friendly.  The neighborhood was super quiet and street parking is plentiful. <br/><br/>Normally I'm only in LA for 3 nights at a time but if I'm down again for another longer stretch, Cecilia's would be on the top of my list.",clean
"Cecilia's place looks exactly like the photos. I enjoyed watching the TV show ""Wheel of Fortune"" with her. The kitchen is well-equipped for cooking and her dog Pepper is affectionate.",clean
"Great apartment on the waterfront and within easy reach of 2nd Street bars, restaurants and shops.<br/>The bed was really comfortable and it was quiet at night guaranteeing a great nights sleep to recharge the batteries. Would definitely rebook when next time we stay in Long Beach",location
"Beautiful place, literally steps from the sand in Alamitos Bay.  Highly recommended for anyone staying in the area.  The apartment is spacious and has everything you need for a comfortable stay.",location
"The location is fantastic. There were 4 beach cruisers available for us to use that were in great condition. The boardwalk is a few minutes ride from the apartment. We road bikes for hours along the bike trail and has such a great time. 2nd street is a short walk (3-5 minutes) and has all the shopping, restaurants and charm of a small town Main Street. Kelley was quick to respond and the check in and check out process was so easy. Would definitely recommend staying here for a couple or family with a few small children.",location
Great location. Host responds quickly and cheerfully. You will not regret staying here.,location
"A charming apartment that slept all 4 of us great. Parking on the street wasnât an issue and easy walking distance to the beach. This was a great place to relax, and a good spot for the attractions around LA and Long Beach.",location
"This location is amazing! Waterfront view. Easy walk to the public beach. Easy walk to 2nd street where there are many restaurants, shops, and bars to choose from. Very easy check-in. The bedroom bed was very comfortable, the pull out sofa is to be expected. In a very very quiet neighborhood. The back patio was nice to hang out and chat with privacy. Make sure when doing laundry you give the washer door a nice push so it will start and lock. Check out Riley's for breakfast and bottomless mimosas!",location
Canât beat the location. Bed was comfortable and had what we needed,location
My family and I had a great time.,clean
"So comfortable and homey in a superb location! A charming neighborhood in easy walking distance to restaurants, shopping, and beach. Ideal spot between Long Beach & Huntington/Newport. 4 bikes for guest use, we were on them every day! Great bed & fans for wonderful sleep. Not luxury, but an amazing deal for the price. Thanks, Kelly!",location
"Thank you Kelley, we had a great time.  Very central location for beach walking, biking and restaraunts everywhere.  Great to not look for parking, nice place to chill out.  Kelley was very quick in reponse to any questions.  We will definitley be back",location
"Cute, tidy space close to the beach and great dining.",clean
Great location with the beach right outside the doorstep. Host is quick to communicate if you need anything. Worth every penny.,location
It was very nice and clean . There was a lot to do around the area and it was at a very nice location.,clean
"Kelleyâs  place is at the best location in Long Beach, walking distance to the 2nd street where the restaurant, stores and business are located. Its a couple of miles from SCULB.  Its easy to check in and out. She provide all the basic needs of someone who travels. If you have a big Car (SUV) the parking space is little tight, just need a little maneuver and you should be ok.  There are also a street parking which is not bad. You can do kayaking  just across the street. <br/>The price is reasonable. I would love to go back at Kelleyâs place.",location
Perfect location! Literally 20 feet across the street and your feet are in the sand. Perfect spot for me and my two preteen children. Plenty of room for us and with mini a/c window units in the bedroom and living room the temp was perfect. I only needed to contact Kelley once and she was quick to respond. Pull out bed was comfy and the king size bed was even better. Parking in front wasnât an issue as we could always park in the designated spot. The private patio made a nice addition. Canât wait to stay again!!!,location
We consider this our home away from home.  We've stayed here 3 times & always hate to leave!,location
Nice access to the water.<br/>Really nice to be able to take bikes instead of walking.,location
"Was Very Detailed With Instructions, Very Clean And An Amazing Location...",clean
Kelley's place is fantastic!<br/>It's everything and more as it's described.  So much to do in the area that we barely even used our car and so nice to come back and relax in this wonderful apartment.<br/>Best Airbnb and best vacation ever.  Thank you Kelley!,location
"Rich was an awesome host. The apartment was perfectly located just a couple blocks from the beach, some really cool restaurant/bars, and Pier Ave.. it was recently remodeled and has some really nice modern finishes. There were still a couple upgrades in the bathroom that Rich hadn't completed such as the tub/shower and tub/shower surround which he said he is still working on getting taken care of. Also, the bed was absolutely comfortable. I would absolutely stay at Rich's beach home again.  Thanks Rich!",location
"We had a great time. The apartment is in a great location, well appointed and ver nicely updated. Couldn't be happier with the space and Rich's hosting. ",location
Rich was an excellent host. His place was in great condition and a great location. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a comfortable place to stay in Hermosa Beach.,location
"We really enjoyed the place. Interior was nicer in person than the photos we thought. Nice light, clean and well equipped. Rich was very thorough and accommodating. The location is perfect, and it was great to have a parking spot. We would stay again.",clean
"Great place.   Super clean.   Super comfortable.   Fantastic location.   Good parking.   Close to the beach and pier.   Rich was very responsive.   Highly recommended.  If this size place suits your needs, you won't find better.",clean
"Rich's place was perfect for a couple.  We were easy walking distance to everything in Hermosa Beach, and having parking was a dream.  The apartment is great and recently renovated so everything was in perfect shape.  The neighborhood is classic Hermosa Beach, laid back, quiet and the surf only a few downhill blocks away.  The outdoor space is serene and a great place to chill out.",location
"I recommend this property for visitors to the Hermosa Beach area.  The apartment is conveniently located in a safe area just a few blocks from the beach and boardwalk.  I enjoyed walking to get a cup of coffee each morning.  The apartment is newly renovated with modern appliances, tiled bathroom and very nice outdoor patio area.  Rich communicated with me ahead of time via text and email and left a list of nearby restaurants, etc. as well as information about the apartment.  Bed was comfortable.",location
"Loved the place! Just like the pictures and it was very well decorated. My mom and I came during the week for a couple days, and it was perfect because the city was not crazy (or parking). There was street parking close by that did not have a time limit, just a day for street sweeping. It was only a few blocks from the beach which we loved, and also by lots of great food. I would say the better shopping was in Manhattan, but it was just a couple miles so we walked one day and drove another. Very good central location that was an awesome first visit to the area :) Rich was a great host and very easy to communicate with. We will definitely come back and stay again! ",location
"Rich's apartment is great!  Good, safe neighborhood and conveniently located near running paths and shops.  Rich was a good host and available whenever I needed something or had a question. Check in was seamless.  The door has a coded lock, so I did not have to worry about coordinating my check in time with Rich's schedule.  Definite plus. The parking spot out front was helpful too. Parking in Hermosa Beach is competitive. I would stay here again.",host
"Rich was a great host and his apartment is in the perfect location for a beach getaway. My girlfriend and I stayed here for the 4th of July weekend and it was a lot a fun. Walking distance to the beach, the bars and the restaurants. There is even a little store/deli around the corner. The place looks exactly like the pictures, roomy, clean with a great patio. This is definitely a great place to stay for a beach getaway!",location
"The host was very pleasant and made us feel very welcome. The house is just liked she listed and very charming. It was the perfect size for what we needed (6 people), lots of room (never felt on top of each other) and very nice size backyard with a grill. In the evenings we enjoyed sitting in the backyard with a glass of wine. ",location
"Great family place. Very safe neighborhood, friendly neighbors and we loved that we had the whole place to our self; we felt right at home.",location
"The location and value is wonderful. We stayed in the 1 bedroom upstairs. The only thing that we misunderstood is we thought we had the balcony overlooking Bayshore Ave. That is actually the studio apartment balcony, not the 1 bedroom. There is a sitting area in the  1 bedroom located in the back of the apartment outside, but there is no view of the water. The place is well stocked with coffee and tea, plates, silverware,  kitchen stuff, etc.  We ate out everyday, but it has everything if you want to cook in the apartment. The bed was comfortable. Dish satellite is there and has Showtime. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and plan to return. Thanks Kelley!",location
"The location  of the apartment is really great. Our little son loved the beach. Kelley was very accomodateing concerning the ceck in time. If you have car and want to use the parking space in the back of the house, keep in mind it's quite small. Our rental car (for 5 people + plus luggage) couldn't fit. So we changed it for a much smaller, which fit into the parking space but was almost too small for us. ;-)  On the other hand it was lovely that the street between the house and the beach doesnt allow cars during the day.",location
Kelleyâs place was nice and a perfect location. She was a great and responsive host. The bikes and beach equipment provided was a great plus for our stay. I would definitely choose to stay here again.,location
Outstanding!!!!! Must stay place. Bars/food/entertainment all in walking distance and a great experience. Beach is awesome and the people are very welcoming.,location
Great location. Good communication. Adorable little place.,location
"This is a great little place in a really nice neighborhood. Worked out so nicely for my family (11 year old twins plus 2 adults). Super walkable to lots of restaurants, stores etc. We visited family/friends in LA and also went to Disneyland and the apartment was a  very convenient home base. After a long day at Disneyland it was so nice to come back to a cute, comfortable place only 25 minutes away! Also, Kelley left granola bars and coffee... essentials when you arrive at a rental and haven't gotten to the store yet. The apartment is right across from a pretty and clean beach with great activities for families and adults. Finally, at the end of our stay there was a mishap with the key and lockbox. Totally my fault and probably quite inconvenient for Kelley. Kelley was nothing but gracious and kind about it. Wonderful place. Wonderful host. Hope to return!",location
"Perfect location! Kelleyâs place had everything you needed to have the perfect beach get away. The Bay is a nice spot to lounge around and the Beach is walking distance. There are boogie boards, umbrellas and beach toys and beach towels ready for use. Kelley has great communication and even checked in on us during our stay to make sure we were having a good time. Walking distance to shops and restaurants. We will definitely be back.",location
Very clean with good access to a nice beach.,clean

Kelleyâs home is great for a small group. Perfect location! Beach right outside your door and lots of restaurants and bars within walking distance. Beautiful community. <br/>We met Kelley as well and she was very nice. She also showed us her downstairs Airbnb which is a lot bigger if you have a bigger group and with a much better view from your patio. <br/>I highly recommend Kelleyâs place. We will definitely be staying here again in the future.,location
"We really enjoyed staying at Kelley's place, only a few metres from the beach, how good is that! We rented kayaks one day (a 2 min walk from the apartment) to go round Naples island, used the bikes from the apartment one day to cycle to the Queen Mary and ran along the beach, can't get better than that!",location
"Not quiet what I was expecting but overall it was good location, water just steps away. No view of the water form the patio or common space. Overall cleanliness was an issue",location
"Clean and comfortable. We felt it was the best location in Long Beach. Walking distance to all the bars, restaurants and shopping in Belmont Shores. We walked to the beach most mornings. great walking and biking trail along beach.  Lots of swimmers in the bay across the street. 20 minute car ride to Huntington Beach on Ocean Blvd. to watch surfers have a bite to eat and drinks. 30 minutes to Disneyland. 30 minutes to Santa Monica Pier. 30 minutes to downtown L.A. We went to the Coliseum for NFL Game took the tram great way to beat traffic.  Aquarium and Queen Mary are 10 minute drive with no bad traffic.  We spent a lot of time at the many bars on 2nd st. very friendly and reasonably priced.  Many good restaurants. Good meal at Nicks on 2nd.  Nico's.  Michael's.  to name a few. Very safe neighborhood we always felt comfortable. Bonus, all with in walking distance.  Bed was very comfortable.  We had a couple questions Kelley answered immediately. You can't go bad staying here. Anything we needed was here. Thanks Kelley",location
"The house is really beautiful and even more than in the pictures ! All of the rooms are convenient and the house had everything we needed, which was a plus.<br/>The area is quiet and close to supermarkets and 15-20 minutes by car from malls and the Long Beach airport.<br/>Jackie was an excellent host, always easy to reach and really nice.<br/>We had an incident with the house plumbing which was settled really fast.<br/>If I plan another stay in Long Beach I'll definitely stop by again.",location
"Jackie was an awesome host-- she always replied to emails/text messages and was so patient when my colleagues and I were trying to find her house. Her listing blew us away-- the pictures don't do the house justice. Not only is it a beautiful home and neighborhood, but it was clean and made all of us feel right at home.  We would definitely HIGHLY recommend staying here if you're visiting Long Beach!",clean
"Rich was very friendly and hospitable. Our stay was wonderful. His place was so quick to the beach (5 min) a many restaurants and stores were a very short distance. Furnishings were very updated and comfortable. There were even towels, beach chairs, and an umbrella to take to the beach! Rich was always available via texts and responded to our requests very promptly. Thanks! ",clean

"Great apartment in great location. Loved Hermosa Beach, really nice community feel. Rich really helpful.",location
"Rich is one of the best host weâve met ever. He is very responsive. We arrived his house a little bit late but he met us and gave us a kind instruction. Room is very clean and enough space. We stayed with my wife and three small kids. One king size bed and folding sofa bed was enough for us. Location is also very nice. 5 minute walk to the beach and very close to Hermosa beach restraint. At first night, we found that cork screw was missing. We texted him and he replaced new one at next day.  Also disposer didnât word well, but it was fixed on next day.  All of our family of five felt very happy and fully satisfied. We will stay at him again when we visit LA beach area next time. Highly recommended. ",clean
"They say ""LOCATION! LOCATION! LOCATION!"" and this apartment had that to the beach, Hermosa Beach ""downtown"" area.  It was great!",location
"I'm echoing a lot of guests when I genuinely say that Rich was an attentive host. His apartment is especially ideal (location, space, and amenities) for a few folks wanting to get away, but, still have quite a few options for activities close by. Thanks again for a pleasant stay, Rich! ",clean
"Spacious apartment about 3 blocks from Hermosa beach. They also provide beach umbrella, beach chair, beach towel, washer and dryer. Comfortable bed, nice bathroom and small courtyard we enjoyed sitting out there during breakfast.<br/><br/>Check in and check out was easy, Rich have the place clean and tidy ready for us to move in when we arrive. Having a off street car park is great. ",location
"Rich's place was fantastic! Great location about 4 blocks from Hermosa beach and maybe 6 blocks from the restaurants & bars on Hermosa Ave. We also checked out Manhattan Beach which is just under 1 mile away. Another benefit, the place has these great beach chairs we took with us to the beach.<br/><br/>Apartment-wise, Rich has everything you need, comfy bed and was very clean. We cooked breakfast at the house each morning and all the appropriate pots & pans are there as are olive oil, cooking spray, etc. which makes it all super easy!<br/><br/>All in all, this place is hard to beat! And the key code entry lock meant no getting locked out! <br/>Thanks Rich!",clean
"Rich's apartment was a pleasure to stay at.  It was clean and recently remodeled.  Rich supplied shampoo and body wash, a kitchen full cooking utensils, dishware, etc., and beach chairs, towels, and umbrella. The apartment is also in a great location.  It was a five minute walk to the sand, and we were about a 10 minute walk from downtown Hermosa Beach.  Rich was very friendly and struck the perfect balance of giving us our space and making himself available.  I would definitely recommend and would stay here again.",clean
"Rich was a great host.  The apartment was just as described - updated, clean, and nice walking distance to the beach and to restaurants and things to do.  He provided nice amenities like a beach umbrella, beach chairs, free laundry (including detergent) and sunscreen.  It was unusually hot in Hermosa Beach the days we were there (I lived in the area for years and it only gets that hot a couple days a year) and Rich proactively got in touch with us to offer to bring extra fans to make sure we were comfortable.  The apartment was big enough for a couple, or for a family with one or two kids. Check in and check out were very easy - we definitely recommend it.",clean
"Everything was great! The house was nice, and very clean. The neighborhood is great, just a few blocks from a nice calm beach! ",clean
Rich made us feel welcome and the place was as described.  A great place to stay in Hermosa Beach. ,clean
"We rented all three units at this location since several members of our family meet for Thanksgiving week.  We have rented the units in prior years for the same reason.  We love the location - across from the bay and so convenient to 2nd St. which is a great walking street with lots of shops and fantastic restaurants.    Kelley has always been very accommodating which we've really appreciated.  The kitchens are well equipped and there are plenty of towels, soaps, shampoos, etc.    We hope to be able to rent the units in the future for other Thanksgiving holidays.  All-in-all, a comfortable stay for our family.",location
Excellent location in Long Beach/Naples/Belmont Shore area. Kelley responds quickly and our experience was great! Highly recommend!,location
We stayed 2 nights to<br/>visit family and friends in the area. Kelleyâs apartment has a great location and is comfortable and clean. Kelley was very responsive and thoughtful. Weâd definitely stay at her apartment again.,clean
Truly enjoyed our stay,clean
"Overall, we had a nice stay.  Then Unit has everything one needs and is pretty kid friendly.  Location is incredible and thatâs what youâre there for. <br/><br/>Keep in mind that there are two other units in the same building and you all share the two bikes/common beach gear etc.  We never got a chance to use the bikes the week that we were there.  The walls are pretty thin (as are most locations in the area) so being earplugs if youâre a light sleeper. <br/><br/>The only quibble we had was that the downstairs unit occupants would do their laundry all day and late into the evening most days and the entire upstairs unit would vibrate.  A mild annoyance, not a reason to not stay here.  And if youâre out and about most of the time, it shouldnât be an issue.",location
Nice homely place in a nice waterfront location.,location
"The location for this unit is amazing! Right across the street from the water, with a view of the beach when you open the door (no view inside the apartment). It's not sparkling clean, but the unit has all the essentials: laundry, dishwasher, pull-out bed (some broken springs and a little hard to use). We used the 3 bikes to ride around Naples Island, which is just across the bridge and is beautiful. Kayaks and paddle boards can be rented just down the beach, and you can easily take them through the canals. Walking distance to shopping/restaurants.",location
Great location great communication great check in parking is in alley for smaller vehicle,location
"Great location, even better living space. I felt right at home, check in was easy, Kelley was always available!<br/>Plenty to do in less than a 10 minute bike ride  with bikes PROVIDED BY KELLEY!!! Balcony out back was great for some hot drinks and relaxation at night. The room is super cozy! And the water is right at your front door. Loved our stay. Will definitely be back!",location
Kelly is a wonderful host with generosity and quick responses! Home was clean and perfect for our mother daughter trip in a great location.,clean
"Amazing stay! For being just steps away from the sand and staying for the whole weekend, the price was more than reasonable. The kitchen was filled with so many appliances, spices, sauces, teas, oils, etc. the bathroom had things just in case you forgot, the bed was so comfy, and the couch pulled out into a bed. Thereâs even a back patio! Super lovely space and Kelley was very kind and responsive. 10/10 recommend!!!",location
My first time using Airbnb and can I just say wow!! the experience was completely hassle free and I had a wonderful host. The apartment was in a perfect location and had everything you needed when traveling with kids!! The place was spacious and very clean. It was absolutely perfect in every way I have not one complaint. The ac unit worked well and the showers were extra hot. There was water toys for the kids and bikes but we sadly did not use the bikes but would have been nice too. The parking provided was great and I was super relieved that I did not have to find parking since Beach goers took most of the parking so having a reserved space was a lifesaver. A little tight but if youâre a good driver you will be fine. What a wonderful stay I will definitely be back!!!,clean
Great getaway! Near the ocean.. my daughter enjoyed it! I would definitely come back,location
This apt is in literally the best location ever. It is a super cute apt and has everything you need. Hosts are extremely responsive and try to make sure you have everything you need. We had the best vacation and are planning on coming back ASAP!,location
"Rich's place is astonishingly great--more than accurately depicted, it's actually even more inviting and comfortable in person. The details are perfect, the shower is superlative, and the bed extraordinarily comfortable. Not to mention, it's an incredibly convenient location.<br/><br/>Rich also left detailed guides about where to go and what to do, making for a wonderfully seamless experience. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay there and would come back without hesitation!<br/><br/>Also: the heat and humidity was off the charts during our stay, but the amount of fans in the place mostly negates it. I really appreciate that he accounted for this possibility and took care of it before we even arrived.",location
"This was a great place to stay, with an ocean view and just a short 3 blocks or so from the water's edge. Beautiful neighborhood, with a variety of gorgeous homes to see. Everyone I met, which wasn't many people. was super nice and polite. The apt. had everything I could possible need and the bed was very comfy. The little back patio was an extra nice spot. I would book this same spot again.",location
"This was probably my best Airbnb experience as of yet! The apartment was so clean, cute and completely updated. It was situated in a nice established residential area, and in close proximity to everything, from the beach to restaurants to entertainment options. I cannot  wait for my next visit to Hermosa Beach! I will definitely make this my go-to spot when I am in town again. Thank you, Rich!",clean
Rich was very friendly and we had a great time staying in his appartment. We stayed in the appartment for 4 days and check in and out was easy. Don't think there is that much to add that has not already been said but the neighborhood was very nice and a parking spot was available right outside the apartment which was great since we came with a rental car and drove a lot while staying there. The apartment was located just a few blocks from the beach and a few minutes walk along the beach you had some restaurants and bars right by the pier. Overall we had a great time and I would love to stay here again.<br/><br/>,location
"Rich and his place were both awesome. The shade in the back yard made it perfect to chillax under the sun. The place is kept in perfect condition. Rich is also a very laid back guy, and definitely non-intrusive (we only bumped into him the day before we left). I would strongly recommend the place and its setting - being able to walk to the beach in minutes while being close to the city on the PCH makes it a perfect location. Also: Chipotle within walking distance!!!",location
"Great location, everything you need for a trip in LA!",location
"We rented the suite for 4 days in October and loved it. It's in a really great location and is nicely styled inside, with all the amenities you could need. Rich was also helpful in providing tips on places to go in the neighbourhood.<br/><br/>Only feedback would be:<br/>- A full-length mirror would be good <br/>- A/C for really hot days (to be installed after we left)<br/><br/>We really liked this place and would come back if we are in LA again. Thanks Rich!",location
"The place was great! Rich was super accommodating. The neighborhood was amazing, super close to the beach and local shops and restaurants. Would love to one back again!",location
"We had the most perfect stay at Rich's spot. It was just like a hotel - with our own private outdoor space to enjoy the sunshine. It was very modern & clean, and only a short walk to the beach & shops. Will absolutely stay there again!",location
"Rich was a wonderful host and his apartment was adorable. This was our first Air B & B experience and it definitely set the bar high. While I am local to So. Cal. I'd never spent any time in Hermosa. I will be spending time there now, though, because it is such a cute beach town. Rich's place was just a few short blocks to the beach and the neighborhood was cute and safe. We really enjoyed our visit and Rich's great hospitality- he went out of his way to make sure we had a great time! ",host
"The apartment we rented from Rich is really very nice and comfortable. Also its so suitable to visit the southern beaches of LA, of which Hermosa Beach, that is in distance less than 5 minutes walking, is for us the most beautiful. Towels are enough available to use so that means more space in your   suitcase. Thank you again for your service!",location
"Rich's place was simply perfect. Great location, clean modern and very cozy. Rich was a fantastic host and made sure I was well taken care off. I will be staying here next time I am in LA. <br/><br/>The beach is only a few blocks away and it is about 15 minutes from the airport. The back patio was perfect for my morning coffee and relaxation. ",location

The location of the apartment is perfect for strolling around the Hermosa Beach area.<br/><br/>The apartment was nicely updated, as shown in the photos, and very comfortable for our 1-week stay. The backyard area is charming, and although the weather was quite chilly during our first few days there, we enjoyed sitting out there. <br/><br/>Thanks Rich, we enjoyed talking with you!",location
"Rich totally deserves his Airbnb super host title.  Its hard to find a better place to stay in the Beach cities than Rich's apartment.  Everything is clean, modern and comfortable, the kitchen is well appointed, the bed is super comfy, the outdoor patio is perfect, the neighborhood is quiet yet very close to Hermosa Beach action and the beach.  And Rich is super, he's easy going and he genuinely wants our stay to be the best.  I highly recommend!",clean
"Spent two nights in the house and would definitely stay again.<br/>The house is very modern, clean, and the off street parking was a nice bonus.  Very comfy bed, and great private outdoor space.  Rich gets an A+ for communication, very easy check-in and out.  The location is great, and is an easy walk to many bars, restaurants, and the Hermosa<br/>Beach Strand.  Airbnb at its best.",location

We loved our stay in Hermosa Beach. The apartment was just as described.. Comfy and clean (great bed!). The neighborhood is quiet and safe. It was a perfect getaway for my daughter and I who wanted some quiet downtime by the beach. Thanks Rich!,clean
This place was better than even expected! Rich thought of every detail even down to filtered water throughout the home.<br/>The location is perfect- the ocean can be seen from the front porch area.<br/>There is a really nice park just behind the house if you exit east from the house and go south down the hill.  <br/>We enjoyed our stay and would gladly book again! ,location
"Rich was a great host and his place was perfect for us (2 adults and small child). The location is perfect for a beach getaway, the place is pristine with great amenities. Rich's attention to detail will make your stay and trip enjoyable. Everything from a great little garden to sit in and enjoy the weather to the complimentary beach chairs he leaves. Rich is very attentive if you have any issues...we had none except for the TV not working Bc it wasn't plugged in...house cleaning was to blame :-)<br/><br/>Highly recommend staying here...we will back when we are back in Hermosa.",location
"The listing is 100% accurate but I need to stress how beautiful the neighborhood was and how quick it was to get to shops, food, and the beach. The neighborhood was quiet at night and Rich was so helpful with giving us personalized recommendations for where to eat. Would recommend 1000%",location
"This was one of the greatest places we have stayed. Perfect for our small family of three. Very updated, clean and has all the amenities needed for a longer stay. Outdoor lounge area was the best! Rich was very accommodating and responsive, always checking up on us to see if we needed anything. Will definitely stay here again! ",clean
Rich was an excellent host always available anytime. His place was a piece of heaven to have peaceful evenings. I would definitely recommand this place and hope to come back soon !,location
We had a great time staying at the apartment in Hermosa beach! It is located right at the beach and walking distance from shops and restaurants. Rich is a great host who was there to help with anything we needed. ,location
<br/>The apartment was exactly as described and even better as it was fully stocked. We only had to provide our own beer. :-) Beautiful location and Rich was a perfect host. He made sure we had everything we needed and helped out with any questions. The apartment only provided for one parking space but when my daughter and her boyfriend needed a second spot for their car he was able to get us a place. No street parking in Hermosa. We had a truly wonderful experience and would highly recommend Rich's place for anyone thinking of spending time in Hermosa. Thanks again Rich and hope to see you again soon. By the way Rich ordered up the best weather I've seen in LA in the spring in a very long time and didn't even charge extra.,location
We had a wonderful stay at Rich's place. Everything is as described and the location is very convenient 5 minutes walk from the beach. Rich lives above the unit and was available almost immediately when we needed him. I will definitely recommend his place to anyone visiting Hermosa Beach! ,location

"Our stay in Hermosa Beach at Rich's place was wonderful! The apartment was exactly as described and pictured. It was a very quick walk to the beach and located in a pleasant neighborhood. We enjoyed walking to several restaurants in the area and soaking up the beach culture, while also having a quiet house to return to at night. Rich was very responsive to us when we first arrived and made sure we had everything we needed. The addition of beach chairs and an umbrella made our beach days even more enjoyable. It was a perfect place to stay for our small family of three (my daughter is five). I highly recommend staying here! ",location
"Absolutely wonderful experience at Rich's. 5 minute walk to the beach, and it's Hermosa Beach, which is a great surf town.<br/><br/>Rich's place is kept wonderfully neat, and both the bedroom and the pullout bed from the couch sleep great.<br/><br/>There's also the patio in the back, which we used a lot (good pizza delivery places, too!)<br/><br/>Rich is easy to speak with, great with info about places to go, and a wonderful host.",clean
"Thank you so much Rich for allowing us to stay at your place.  It was perfect and the apartment had everything we needed!  You definitely thought of the little things that made it feel like we were home.  We have stayed at multiple Airbnbs and this was by far the coziest.  My daughter keeps referring to your place as ""our beach house.""  Thank you for your efficient communication and thorough apartment details and restaurant suggestions.  <br/>As for location, my fitbit showed that your place is less than 650 steps to the beach! Hopefully we can stay here again in the future.  ",host
Rich gave us specific instructions which made it easy to find and access the property which was great because we couldn't see an address on the house. The neighborhood is quiet and just a short nice walk from the beautiful beach. We had everything we needed and Rish was very responsive to my few questions. ,location
Rich has a wonderful apartment! My family and I were very comfortable with all the modern amenities and attention to detail that was provided. We had an amazing stay! Everything was 5 star; and just as pictured. Loved the private patio and Rich's location in Hermosa is excellent!,location
Excellent host and a beautiful home! Unfortunately was working for much of our stay so didn't get to meet Rich but found him very approachable and contactable. The place is a beautiful little beach apartment and had everything we needed. Would highly recommend!,location

"Rich's place was truly lovely. We had all that was advertised and more. Great extras were the beach chairs & umbrella, because you are just moments from the beach (which is beautiful). Comfortable beds, great little garden with BBQ and fab local restaurants nearby. Rich couldn't have been a better host. Thank you!",location
"Rich is a great host, accommodating, responsive and very helpful. The condo was very nice and clean, and best of all just minutes from the beach. We had a great stay!",location

"This place was perfect! The apartment itself is very clean, and perfect location, just a few minutes walk to the beach. My girlfriend and I stayed for 4 nights and had the best time. We met Rich and he was very friendly and helpful, recommending good places to eat nearby. Also, the California king bed couldn't be anymore comfortable. We would 100% like to stay here again when we return to Hermosa Beach some day!",location
"Our best Airbnb experience so far - it's just like the pictures. This is such a cool unit with everything you need. Super clean and a really nice outdoor area as well. The location is just perfect; a short walk to the beach and many great restaurants in the area too. Only got to meet Rich once, but he was a really great host and very responsive, which made the check in and out very easy for us. We will absolutly come back! ",clean
"Jackie was so easy to communicate with and her home was even better than expected! Cozy beds, spacious kitchen, and a great outdoor patio! My friends and I loved all the little details of the house and it was plenty of room for 6 people. ",clean
"We had a relaxing time when we stayed at Jackie's peaceful and tastefully decorated home in Long Beach.  The beautiful backyard and patio, super kitchen, comfortable beds and walk in shower which met the needs of a family member with disability made it a perfect vacation home.  Any questions we had were quickly answered by text. It was a great location to go and explore the harbor beaches, restaurants etc. The week passed all too quickly. ",location
Jackie was a great host from meeting us for a late night check in and then making sure we had everything we needed. We were there on Business in Long beach and found the location to be perfect for us to get around. The home was very comfortable and clean and would recommend to any one considering a stay in the Long Beach area.<br/><br/>Thank you Jackie!,clean
The neighbor hood  was very quiet love the back yard my grand daughter was able to play outside. Love the kitchen and the master bath the house.  I'm so glad that we rented a home instead of a hotel. ,location
"This place is fun!  It's across the street from the water, and that street has no car traffic from 9 AM - 5 PM on weekdays.  Having your own kitchen is almost a must have right now due to COVID and limited dining options.  Two TVs with lots of channels to choose from, your own washer and dryer, and your own grill on your own deck.  It's quiet at night, so it makes for a perfect home base to enjoy Long Beach.  The bay has no waves, and this part of Long Beach has very small waves, which makes it a great place for families with young kids.  There are also lots of beach toys, umbrellas, chairs, and even adult sized bikes for you to use all included with the rental.  Highly recommended for a classic family beach vacation.",location
"Jackie was super accommodating and helpful and the house was perfect for the three couples who stayed. The outdoor space cannot be beat - and everyone was really comfortable. We did not explore the neighborhood much, but the location was close to downtown and really easy to get in and out of.  Thanks for a great weekend, Jackie!",location

My family and I had a fabulous stay in Long Beach at Jackie's house. Her house is beautiful and so well kept. My son is 2 and the backyard was amazing for him to run around.  The bath was perfect for him too. The master shower is awesome. Kitchen is a dream! It had everything you could possibly need. I had a few random questions while I was there and Jackie always responded to any questions immediately. She was a fabulous host. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Thank you Jackie for your gorgeous home!!!! ,host
The host canceled this reservation 35 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.,clean
"The owner contacted us via email as to the directions for how to get into the house.  We were able to get into the house OK.  We found out after we rented the house that one of the mattresses was an air mattress.  Had we known this before hand, we wouldn't have rented the house.  Also, one of the bathrooms was dirty and had a large clump of hair in the bathtub.  We had to clean this bathroom before we could use it.  The street the house was on appeared OK, but the actual neighborhood was pretty scary (bars on windows, gang signs, etc).  Again, had we known the neighborhood the house was in we would have rented a different house.  We had to kill two cockroaches (in the house) while we were there and each time we went into the house it smelled very musty.  Overall pretty disappointed with our experience.  Not sure if we will rent through Airbnb again.",clean
"Jackie's house is spacious and comfortable .<br/>We liked the nice backyard so much .<br/>Jackie is very nice and helpful also quick to respond. We stayed for ten days and all my family needs were met .<br/>The neighborhood was quiet and felt very safe which helped with being able to relax.<br/>So  I am very happy for my  decision to extend staying for  week.<br/>Thank you Jackie so much,,,",location
Jackie was incredibly accommodating to our needs snd she responded quickly to messages and she was so kind with us. The backyard was lovely and perfect during summer .

"Jackie was a wonderful host! Her home was beautiful and we had a great time while we were there. The house was well stocked with everything we needed and spotless when we arrived.

If we ever come back to Long Beach we would love to stay here again!",clean

"About a minute walk to the beach and 5 mins to Hermosa pier, this is a very well located property. The private outdoor space is a great bonus. There is plenty of choice for eating out, groceries and farmers markets nearby. Everything is well looked after and up-to-date with a good amount of space to relax. Rich is great to deal with and I have had no complaints or issues. I would definitely recommend staying here.",location
"One of the reasons I put my mother up in this place was because of all the good reviews, and specifically about the owner Rich.  I'm happy to report all the glowing reviews we're warranted and accurate.  Rich was a REALLY GOOD host.  He even installed a TV on the bedroom wall b/c I told him my mother likes to watch TV in bed.  As for the place itself, the pictures are very representative of the actual space.  Really nice, clean, everything you'd want in a beach bungalow.  I highly recommend the place and Rich to anyone looking to stay in the Hermosa Beach area!",clean
"Rich was a wonderful host-- very warm, welcoming & friendly. Also very responsive & eager to make our stay comparable to a 4 star hotel. The house has been recently updated & is very comfortable.

The house was perfectly comfortable for two people. The beach is less than a 10 minute walk. We would frequently walk to Pier Ave near the beach where there is a strip of great restaurants and bars. We also enjoyed a visit to the comedy club, which is also under a 10 minute walk away. Grannyâs Grocery is an adorable little deli that is around the corner that became a regular stop for us as well. The area is very safe and welcoming. Overall a great experience. If I ever get the pleasure to visit Hermosa Beach again, I would definitely rent from Rich again.",location

"Kelleyâs place is perfect in terms of location. Right on the bay and a short walk to second street. They shut down bay view everyday which is nice because you donât have to worry about traffic on the streets... especially if you have little ones. Bed was pretty comfortable and sofa has a pull out that has a topper on it adding to the comfort ability. Plenty of towels, blankets etc and even beach toys and chairs for use.

Very nice place! Beach was so close!,location
"Location is amazing, cute space w/ all the necessary amenities! Thanks Kelley!",location
"Across the street from the beach. Literally, the beach is down the stairs and across the street.   Excellent for kids and folks like us who enjoy water sports on the bay or swimming.  Parking was easy with spots on the street as well as a garage on the alley side of the property.   Quiet and private.   Fans in each room keep the air moving if you prefer that as well as AC in the bedroom and family room.  TV was solid with DISH tv.   Kitchen was complete with what youâd need (we cooked several times per day).  Washer/dryer was the âstackableâ space saving type, so not overly large, but they did the trick for sure.  BBQ on back patio was in near new condition.   Back patio had outside seating for eating or relaxing that was private from anyone else.   If you are looking for views of the water and beach from the balcony, this isnât it.  This is the unit in the triplex thatâs isnât overlooking the beach, but thereâs a little view with the front door open.   But a couple steps down the stairs and....viola, the beach and bay are right there!   Enjoy, we did!   And, we would recommend.",location
Awesome location awesome place,location
"Our stay with Kelley was a horrible experience. The place was not clean which was very troubling since this was during COVID. After an incident with the garage door that closed on our car while unpacking, the hosts showed up and accused us of backing into the garage door and causing damage that was clearly pre-existing (we have photos of damage that has dirt build up in it). After assessing the damage they insisted we pay the repairman cash rather than go through AirBnB and made us feel very uncomfortable. This behavior combined with the dirtiness of the house led us to cancel our stay and move to another AirBnB. Would not recommend staying here.",clean
"Donât think twice about staying in this Airbnb!! Kelleyâs home, hospitality, and amenities provided were everything I could have asked for and more. She has set the bar for my future stays with others hosts through Airbnb. <br/><br/>Letâs talk about the location... <br/>My purpose for renting Kelleyâs home was to find my own future home in the Belmont Shore area and get to know my new neighborhood. I was able to walk to everything on 2nd street in a matter of a few steps and was able to walk to all my desired locations. Not to mention I woke up every morning to the most spectacular view. If you are looking for a stay in a location that allows you to be in walking distance to the best of what Belmont Shores has to offer; look no further. This is the home for you!<br/><br/>Now I want to talk about my hosts... Kelley was on top of everything. She responded to any of my questions in a matter of seconds and was extremely personable. Her beautiful home aside, she is kind, genuine, and resourceful! <br/><br/>The home was exactly what I needed. Washer and dryer in unit, heat and AC, and condiments I was able to use to cook my meals. Iâm a girl who loves her sleep, and I slept like a baby my two whole weeks there. <br/><br/>As a newbie to the Belmont Shore area, the parking is crucial. She provides an accessible garage spot right behind the property which made all the difference in the world. <br/><br/>Not gonna lie, I was genuinely sad to leave this Airbnb. I found my new home in Belmont Shores, and I have Kelley, her husband, and her incredible home to thank. <br/><br/>If you read anything that is less than exceptional about Kelley and her home, itâs a bunch of BS! I am so thankful and grateful for the opportunity I had to stay here and genuinely plan to stay in touch with Kelley. Thatâs how much I loved her!<br/><br/>Thank you Kelley for everything and I wish you nothing but the best! 5 stars all around!!",location
Perfect place all around for our stay. Amazing location right on the water and great restaurants and shops in close walking distance. The bikes provided were an awesome addition with a nice bike path along the beach. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook our meals. Having free parking in the garage was also a huge plus. Kelley makes it an easy check in/out and is very quick with responses with any questions. Highly recommend this place. <br/><br/>Thanks Kelley!,location

"Me, my husband and our son LOVED Kelly's place! When the listing said we would be across the street from the beach, I was thinking a busy street, but not it was not busy and was LITERALLY across the street! The apartment was nice and had everything we needed to enjoy the stay. Kelly was VERY responsive when I had questions.  All kinds of food and shopping were about a 5 minute walk from the house.  Everyone around us was so nice and friendly. We plan to come back in July and will check to see if this place is available.",clean
Kelleyâs place is perfectly situated and close to everything!  It creates a very peaceful and relaxing atmosphere if anyone wanted a place just busy enough to provide a pleasant atmosphere.  Would recommend to anyone looking for an relaxing place near the beach.,location
"Excellent place! Will be back here to stay.  Beautiful view, clean apartment, restaurants within walking distance, and of course, beach right in front of you.  Busy during the day but very quiet in the night.   I have a Mazda CX-9 which would not fit in the garage but I always found street parking close to the apartment. <br/><br/>Kelley is very responsive but everything that you need is already there in the apartment.",location
"A great location for families! The beach is clean, safe, and easy to access safely as Bay Shore is closed to traffic on weekdays. There are tons of towels and all the kitchen items we needed. We appreciated the dedicated parking and proximity to the great restaurants on 2nd.",clean

"great location, right by a lot of bars and shops, it is across the street from a beach, and there is another Beach down the street. the host is very nice and communicated promptly and was attentive which is huge for me. I really appreciated her. absolutely would visit again.",location
This is a perfect vacation spot! They had everything we needed and lots of kitchen accessories if you want to cook while you stay. The grill on the back patio and bikes were very useful. Parking is sometimes limited so it was nice to have a garage as well. Highly recommend!,location
"Kelley's place was great.  super cute and close to both the beach, paddle boarding, and restaurants and activities.",location
Location was great. Kelley was a very great and understanding host. Lots of beach gear accessible to guests and the beach right across the street was amazing!,location

Be bedazzled by the home's wondrous array of high tech amenities including wall mounted ipad, full surround sound music and heated floors. Experience the joy of balancing the stellar outdoor attractions with the natural beauty of this home.",location
"We had the most incredible time during our stay at Jim's property.  It is so modern and clean and comfortable.  The neighbors are very friendly and welcoming and you are so close to the beach and the boardwalk.  Here are great restaurants all around.  The house is immaculate.  We annoyed the steam shower and the huge bathtub.  We also loved making s'mores by the fire pit.  Jim is an excellent host.  He's so easy to contact and he has thought everything out so your arrival and stay go very smoothly.  We were very comfortable and happy during our stay.  Great wifi, comfy beds, quiet location but very close to EVERYTHING.  We highly recommend this place :)",clean
"Staying with Jim was the most relaxing and fun experience that I've ever had on airbnb! Not only was the house perfect (comfortable beds, sofa, high-tech with surround sound pandora and smarttv), but Jim was the most gracious and welcoming host. He welcomed my pup with open arms! My pup and I spent many glorious days basking in the sun on the front patio, and taking long walks around the beautiful marina del rey canals. Jim's place is walking distance to everything you could want - cafes, beach, abbot kinney, stores. My friends and I spent several nights making smores (which Jim provided for us) around the firepit into the night. Also, Jim's community is amazing, and in a short week I got to know many people in the neighborhood. Don't miss taking a bath in the stellar tub! I absolutely loved staying at Jim's, and I hope he will have us back next time we are in LA!!! I was SO RELAXED the whole time. I loved it. Thanks Jim for an amazing week!!",location
"My friends and I had an awesome time at Jim's beach house. The place is very modern with awesome amenities like spa-like bathroom, amazing outdoor patio with grill, and sound system connected to all the rooms. There is a fire pit where you can also grill Smores! (Jim left us a starter kit to get us started!) Location is unbeatable with the beach 1 minute away and the boardwalk with restaurants and bars nearby. Jim was a great host and answered all my questions promptly and was super helpful on all issues. Will definitely stay here again.",location
"Jim is a great host and the rental was as beautiful as the pictures.  Loved having the open air living room and the fire pit was nice as a couple nights were cooler.  Great for cooking both inside and out, and great restaurants nearby.  Lots of places to walk and enjoy sights, beaches, boardwalk, etc.  Beds were extremely comfortable, best sleep ever.  House is run on an ipad which was a little challenging but nice music streaming, and no broadcast TV but Netflix. Only real bummer was that we weren't told they were renovating the upstairs which meant rude awakening on Monday with power tools starting at 7:30 or 8 overhead for the rest of the week and no escaping the workers view as the upper unit overlooks the patio.   If it weren't for the construction I would say it was worth the price and would have been ultra relaxing.<br/><br/>",location
"This apartment is in a great location, within walking distance to the beach and also Washington Blvd. It is also quite peaceful. The interior is nicely done, and we enjoyed using the patio.<br/><br/>Jim is a good host, and is available to help or answer questions. <br/><br/>We would enjoy staying here again.",location
Jim was great!  He walked me through and left videos on how to use everything.  The house is so relaxing and we had an amazing time.  Even better than the pictures. ,clean
Great relaxing place right on the canal. The house was very tasteful in design and quite comfortable. I'd go back just for the speakers in the bathroom. The fire pit is also a huge plus. ,location
Great home and location. Just as described. Very dog friendly set up and location. ,location
"Great service, and amazing place with unparalleled canal experience. We loved the modern design, seamless inside-outside living and the heated floors.",location
"Stayed for my husbandâs birthday and the photos posted do not do the place the justice it deserves. If youâre looking to feel like you are a thousand miles away from it all, without being thousands of miles away â look no further.  <br/>Heated floors, electronic shades, high tech appliances in the kitchen, a stunning bathroom with a beautiful deep set bathtub, free flowing non enclosed shower, steam /shower room , and much more luxury awaits you.  Bring the outside, inside (or vice versa) with the clean design of indoor/outdoor sliding glass retractable doors in the living area and master bedroom.  Right on the canal, the morning greets you with the sound of ducks, and birds chirping.  Just a few steps down the road and youâre greeted by a quiet strip of beach. You really couldn't ask for anything more. We spend the night warming our hearts by the fire pit, and the morning sitting on the deck with coffee chatting with friendly neighbors as they passed by with pups.  I posted photos of our stay to (Hidden by Airbnb) and have already had at least 5 people inquire about how we found such an awesome place.  No doubt, it will be hard to find this sexy, modern place available. If your dates are open, BOOK! FAST! <br/>",location
"Jim was wonderfully accommodating and very responsive. His place was impeccably clean, modern, yet comfortable. It was a joy to stay for the weekend with my family. ",clean
"We had a great time in Jim's apartment. It is the height of electronic design!! Everything operated by a switch in the wall. Big comfy beds, superb kitchen (apart from the smoke alarm) and luxurious bathrooms. ",location
Jim was there to greet us when we arrived.  We never met anyone in the neighborhood as we left early each day but did see a lot of happy people strolling up and down along the canal every morning.,location
"I rented Jim's property for two clients of mine for an extended stay in Los Angeles. They loved the accommodations - everything was exactly as described and the perks (BBQ, fire pit, steam shower, etc) were very much appreciated it! I had the pleasure of visiting myself one evening and I think Jim has done an excellent job setting up the space for guests. When we had an urgent house-related question, Jim responded within the hour, despite being out of the country. Very efficient communication in arranging the rental as well. I would happily stay there myself or recommend it to a friend! ",clean
Place was absolutely amazing. Had everything you need to get away a relax. Only a few blocks from the beach. The decor and whole setup of the house was perfect.,location
Awesome stay from start to finish. Great location- 3min walk to the beach. Every mod con you could ask for and super comfy bed!! Ron was at hand for any questions we had- super<br/>Host. You must light the fire pit and have bbq. Thanks Ron. X ,clean
"From the onset Jim was helpful, welcoming and nothing short of the perfect host. I travel TOO MUCH for work and this was by far the best airbnb I have stayed at.",clean
"Jim's place is perfect for a relaxing break in Venice. Well positioned by the beautiful canal and within a quick walk to the beach, you're also a 10min Uber away from downtown Santa Monica. Be sure to take a ride on Jim's bike and also to sit around the fire pit. Jim was a courteous host and made sure we had everything we needed.",location
Beautiful home. Everything you would need. Hostess extremely accommodating.,clean
"Jackie was an awsome host. I was there with my full family and she was sure to give us the space peace of mind we needed. She also didn't hesitate to help when she could and was extremely generous with everything in the house which she offerd us to use. We really felt at home after a couple of days. The houses open concept and especially the back yard was beyond awsome. Although the location of the house might seem a bit of a drive from the hotspots in LA, being at long beach made it perfect for nice drives to Hollywood, Anaheim and Laguna beach as well.",location
"Jackie is a fantastic host with a friendly, welcoming attitude and provides all of the details you will need in her communication.  She's also responsive to my questions and very accommodating.  We had a great time at her lovely house.  ",host
"Kelley's house on Bayshore Lane is in a great location with the Bay directly across the street.  This is a very popular area, so access to the garage for parking is a HUGE plus.  Communication was timely and accurate.  We fully recommend it and will stay again.",location
"Wow!  Kelleyâs place had everything we needed for a fun, relaxing stay!!!  Fantastic locationâ¦easy walk to 2nd street and a huge selection of restaurants, bars and shops.  Amazing view and location right on the bay.  We enjoyed using the bikes to ride along the waterfront.  Communication was quick and friendly.  Easy check-in.  Place was very clean and comfy.  Highly recommend!!!  Thank you Kelley!!",location

Great location with a lot of activities to do in the area. Right across the street of the sand. we had the opportunity to schedule the Gondola ride in Naples and it was wonderful. withing walking distance to Naples Canal and every Tuesday there is Jaz  concert around Naples Park.,location
"Wonderful place to stay in the best location for access to bay, beach and 2nd Street restaurants and fun. We had everything we needed. Kelley was quick to replace the battery in the garage door opener for us. What a great beach house!!!",location
"Weâve been coming to visit my parents nearby for decades and always stayed in a hotel if we had excess family. But, I wanted Beach access, and this beautiful place gave us that and so much more!! <br/><br/>Kelleyâs wonderful description of all there is to do in the area gave our family a new appreciation for the area. She was responsive when we needed help w parking and helped guide us in at night as we arrived at night. <br/><br/>Her spacious apartment was perfect for our adult son and my husband and I, plus we had my mom over for dinner twice. Canât wait to come back!",location
What a great location! It was super convenient to have a garage and to not have to worry about parking. Every morning we walked to get coffee and then took walks on the beach.,location
"Jackie's house was perfect for our specialized film industry team. We work very long hours, so to have a place to rest is key for the success of our projects. A home such as hers was the perfect alternative than a hotel stay which our team is used to throughout the majority of their tour. The home was also close to our film set as well as nearby Downtown Long Beach.<br/><br/>Jackie was very accommodating and easy to get ahold of. ",location
"Jim's home was perfect for the baby shower that we hosted for our friend. The space was exactly as pictured, with even more modern conveniences than expected. We loved how the glass doors opened onto the canal so that our guests could enjoy the inside and outside simultaneously. The view is gorgeous from the living room and the spacious outdoor patio. As far as accommodations, we liked that there was heating in each room which allowed adjustment to your own temperature's needs. We loved the master bathroom's soaking bathtub and the unique fixtures (the water falls from the ceiling into the tub ;) This is not a typical airbnb rental where the owner cut corners because it is a rental, the construction/design was thoughtful and well executed. Thank you so much Jim for our stay. ",location
"Our stay at Jim's apartment was one of the best I ever had. The apartment is superb and the location on the canal is very beautiful and peaceful while close to everything. We were there only for four days over Christmas and had many gatherings to attend but we were always looking forward to waking up to the beautiful view from the living room. In addition to being artfully designed - really, everywhere you look is a pleasure for the eyes -, the apartment is very well equipped: modern appliances, state-of-the-art lighting system, ipad controlled AV system, slate floors, very nice and modern shower in the one bathroom and beautiful large bath in the other. Last but not least, the communication with Jim was perfect. There was no need to meet him as he sent us a video on how to get in the apartment, and he was answering any question very quickly when needed. We didn't have many questions as everything was working very well. This might be a detail but I really liked the fact that there was no key to get in (you had to enter a code). It was very secure and very convenient. I strongly recommend this place; it is a real gem! Thank you Jim.<br/>Isabelle",location
"This home is beautiful - pictures don't do it justice - and the location is perfect. You can walk to the main MDR channel, all around Venice and even up to Abbott Kinney if you're feeling adventurous. We used to live in Santa Monica and this place made us sad that we never considered living in this area. The hosts were great, and were already talking about when we will be back! ",location

A stunning oasis beyond expectations <br/><br/>Will return for sure- <br/><br/>Jim+his home= AMAZING ,location
"What a great place to stay - comfortable, centrally located, great outdoor space, well decorated, and pet friendly. The whole place was recently renovated and done really well. We cooked in 3 or 4 nights a week, and it was a great kitchen and the outdoor grill was super. On top of how great the place is, Jim is a responsive and honest host. We were there for 30 days and the only thing I wish was that we had another 30 days to stay. ",location

"This place is exceptional. Great location with all the Venice attractions,<br/>restaurants and bars only a short walk away. The apartment itself is very well appointed - wait until you see the bathroom features! Jim was very easy to communicate with and there were no problems with check-in and -out. I'd definitely stay here again. ",location
"The pictures don't do this place justice. It's meticulously maintained, modern and hip. Jim was a great and easy host. He met us there showed us around and was very easy to contact. Great location, we were able to walk everywhere and only 2 blocks from the beach.  Highly recommend!",location
"This is a gem -- centrally located, comfortable, well-maintained, luxurious. Photos tell us everything. The place is 2-5mins walking from the beach, yet quite from any noise. The house was clean and professionally maintained. It included everything I can ask for -- kitchenware, ceiling speakers, TV, etc,. Highly recommended and I would like to visit again!",clean
Awesome place! Very peaceful.,location
This is a wonderful home - very modern and week-appointed.  It's right on the canal with great paddle boarding and walking.   Opening the beautiful doors in the morning to hear the birds and watch the neighborhood is terrific.   The restaurants and beach access is wonderful!   We will be back...very special place..,location
Really is an idyllic spot and a perfectly maintained apartment. The indoor outdoor lifestyle is wonderful and watching the ducks swim past on the Grande Canal is a soothing and beautiful experience. Would definitely come back again. ,location
"This home is a perfect place to relax and just soak in the beautiful scenery which is reminiscent of Southern France. My husband, sister, and I stayed here to celebrate her birthday. The space is extremely clean and modern paying beautiful attention to detail: the tiling, furniture, indoor/outdoor aspect, shower, bathtub, etc.... We would definitely come back and stay in this lovely home. Our host Jim was around when we arrived, so he took the time to show us how to use the TV, operate the music, open the accordion doors, and some kitchen functions. We had French press coffee every morning on the beautiful front patio watching the canal water rise and fall. The beach is just a couple blocks away, so we rarely needed to use our car, just to head to Malibu for a day. This place is an absolute gem!",clean
"Great stay! Convenient location. Could be a bit tight for 4 adults, but perfect for 2 adults + 2 kids. Will gladly come back again",location
"First, when we pulled up, we couldnât believe the view. The location was everything perfect, especially for the price. <br/>Then we walked inside, the sweetest-homely feeling embraced us. There were towels and sheets, (bring an extra blanket with you though), condiments and utensils. Love the deck and being outside so close to the beach, you can smell it. <br/>Overall, it was perfect. My parents and I enjoyed our stay.",location
If renting upstairs ask if it is front or back.,location
Nice Beachfront place,location
"Very comfortable unit and pretty much exactly as described in the listing. The kitchen was really well outfitted for cooking at home and the bed was very comfortable.  The bikes are shared by the other units in the triplex, so may or may not be available when you want to use them and while the unit is truly across the street from the beach, the only view is thru the open front door out the common entryway.",location
"House is exactly as advertised: clean, sleek, spacious. Kitchen and bathrooms are fantastic. The living room opens right out to the patio and the canal. It was very warm while we were there, so we didn't use the fire pit or the patio as much as we might have liked, but the easy parking and close proximity to the beach made it all a breeze regardless. Keyless check-in was easy and Jim made himself available for questions, but otherwise stayed out of the way as we made the place our home.",clean
"We loved this place!  The house was very modern and full of useful amenities...we loved the community bar idea.  Marina del Rey is a great area and staying here, you are with in walking distance of not only the beach but many locations for shopping and dining.  Being on the canal was very peaceful and serene and we are looking forward to a return visit.",location
Terrific stay with a great host. Highly recommended.,location
Jim's home is a special place that is truly a hidden gem in Venice. I felt like I was living in a spa which was exactly how I hoped to spend my winter holiday. Their home has a great relaxed feel that is perfect for entertaining. I will definitely be staying there again soon!,location
The apartment is beautiful and comfortable. Very close to the beach and a short walk or ride to restaurants and shops along the coast.,location
Highly recommended.  The home is newly appointed with high-end fixtures. Instructions to everything needed in video/digital format. Great location. Very walkable to both laid-back beach areas/walks and higher traffic commercial spots. One could easily spend a week in this location without needing a car. Terrific host(s) with plenty of local knowledge.,location

It is super stylish, just beautiful being on the canal, peaceful, Marina Del Rey is a lovely area and Jim was on hand to help with anything.  This is a top quality apartment beautifully clean with all the amenities and great host exactly what you expect from a five star Airbnb. Will definitely  come back when we have the chance  and obviously highly recommend. ",location
"A great stay with perfect location and host! Canal is right in front of the house , beach and some good restaurants are steps away.

"This is a nice option in a great and expensive area. Just a few blocks from Washington where there are some restaurants and a Starbucks and close to the historic canals. We were able to rent bikes at the pier and bike to Santa Monica. Close to Marina del Rey and freeways. The place is very stylish and comfy cozy. Loved the panel windows that opened to the patio. The patio was a great place to hang out too. It was chilly when we visited so we did not hang outside as much as we would have liked. There was only one piece of wood for the outdoor fireplace, but we didn't ask for any more as we didn't really use it although it would have been nice to. The bathrooms are the bomb - the steam shower was amazing and my kids commandeered the other bathroom with the tub and shower. We enjoyed our trip and Jim was very responsive if we needed anything. Thank you!",location

"Beautiful place to stay in Venice.  Clean, updated, and very conveniently located, yet quiet and tucked away for privacy.  We enjoyed morning walks along the canals and the quiet location was perfect for a good night's sleep.  We will definitely plan to book Jim's place again on our future visits.",clean
"Wonderful stay at Jimâs place! Jim is a great host, very friendly, knows the good restaurants and bars of the area (make sure you try the prime ribeye at Charcoal restaurant!) easy communication, easy check-in/check-out process, he even left us cold beers in the fridge when we arrives which was greatly appreciated after a long drive from Joshua Tree. Location is the best, very safe and calm and yet youâre within walking distance of everything Venice Beach has to offer. High end renovations and amenities, the house is really comfortable for 2 couples, 2 king size beds, 2 beautiful bathrooms, (the steam shower is amazing) and the beautiful patio overlooking the canal will definitely make all your friends jealous! We will come back when we return to LA! Highly recommended!",location
We rented Jim's place while visiting our son.  The home was exactly as advertised.  It was clean & furnished beautifully.  Both Jim & Lindsay reached out to see if we needed anything.  We had a small BBQ to celebrate a birthday & had everything we needed in the well appointed kitchen.  We would definitely stay again on our next visit.,clean
Jackie was a wonderful host! She responded quickly to every question or concern that I had. I stayed at her lovely home with 9 of my teammates for a local Jiu Jitsu tournament and her house was spacious enough for all of us. I would definitely recommend Jackie and I'm sure I'll use her house again next year! ,host
"I hate to write this review. <br/>Kelley the host is so fantastic. <br/>But I was very disappointed with the quality our stay. <br/>We go to Long Beach 4-6 times a years for my daughters allergy treatment so a clean fresh space is so important and always mentioned to make sure the choice is right for us.<br/>The longer we stayed the more things we noticed that âwerenât quite rightâ. Lots of old items and things thatâs didnât feel fresh or clean. (Shower curtain, towels, pillows, bedding, couch, kitchen ware). <br/>I believe if these items were updated and cleaned a bit deeper this would be an amazing spot! But we were very disappointed.",clean

Very cute neighborhood. Close to everything. Easy drive along the ocean.,location
"First of All, Kelly is super responsive and helpful. The coffee machine broke down on the second day and she was able to deliver a new one for us within an hour, which we are thankful for. Secondly, The house has a great location, right next to the beach and definitely has everything you need in there! If one suggestion I need to give, would be bring your eye masks if you want to sleep in late, the curtain is super light and white, the sunlight will wake you up before 6:30Am. In a word, a truly great vacation in Long Beach and thank you Kelly!",location
Place was just as described. We loved our stay at Kellyâs place!,clean
"Location, location, location. Kelley's apartment is across the street from the beach and a half block from all the restaurants, bars, and various kinds of shops on a very lively 2nd St.  Street parking during our visit was easy but Kelley's garage gives you a refuge for your car on street cleaning days and busy weekend beach days.  Kelley, her husband, son and housekeeper, all helped us out during our visit to an extraordinary extent.  You will not get better customer service anywhere else.  Finally, Kelley's apartment gives you great value for the money.",location
"Location is awesome! We walked to the smoothie bowl place on 2nd each morning and ate on the beach. So fun to have use of the SUPâs, just carry them across the street and take off! Also really handy to have beach chairs and toys to play with as we had flown in from out of town. <br/>Having use of a washer and dryer was really nice too.<br/>The unit itself was spacious and nice, but definitely could be cleaner. It looks like it gets surface cleaned regularly but deep cleaning has been neglected- the shower is very moldy and the A/C unit filters were filthy, we woke up with allergy symptoms after using the fan setting overnight and I was astonished how dirty they were. <br/>Great beach house but if youâre picky about cleanliness Iâd look around a bit more.",location
"Location! Location! This was an amazing location, the Airbnb was clean and had everything we could need. We had a lot of fun and would stay again:)",clean
"We really enjoyed our stay. Wanting to find a place directly on the beach and have designated parking were our top priorities. Kelleyâs apartment was by far the best value that fit the bill.  The only actual beach view in the unit is at the front door.  All the windows face in other directions.  But the sand is literally steps away. Opening windows brings in the salty breezes and the sounds of beach activity that are very satisfying even if you canât see it.   The alley and garage are a little tight as one would expect in a community like this. Our rental car was a Jeep Cherokee and it fit in the garage ok. Any vehicle taller or longer probably would not fit.  <br/>The mattress on the bed is quite firm but still comfortable for a good nights sleep. And the pillows are out of this world plush!  They were so soft and just plain amazing.  <br/>If you need a place to stay with the convenience of having a car to come and go and not stress about parking, or choose to leave the car in the garage and walk to restaurants, shops and of course the beach, while keeping all the amenities of home- this is it.",location
Jackie's home is great and she was a pleasure to coordinate with. The home is very comfy with everything we needed to relax and unwind. ,clean
"Jackie's house is so fancy, and you can find almost everything you need there! Also, she is very nice and kind!",clean
"This place is pure serenity! Iâm echoing other reviews suggestion that this is actually a spa, or at least feels like it! It has amazing little touches like heated floors in the bathrooms, a waterfall faucet from ceiling for the bathtub, soft bathrobes and linens and fancy bath, hair and bubble products. If your looking for a romantic or relaxing getaway from the excitement of LA, look no further than this gem. And an added bonus, you can spend the afternoon watching various water fowl and sea creatures from the amazing patio right on the canal! Then warm up next to a fire in the pit provided through the evening! Perfection!",location

The place is beautifully appointed and very close to a lovely beach. It is two blocks but very short blocks at that.  The patio is a wonderful place to relax and we walked to restaurants and a small market.  Santa Monica is very close as is LAX (no airport noise).  The one issue was we couldn't get the large windows open out to the patio because it was stuck and we didn't want to push too hard but Jim was responsive. I assume all is fixed.  The place is great and I would definitely rent again.,location

This beautiful condo was perfect for our trip. The location cannot be beat. It is 2 blocks to the beach. <br/><br/>We loved the outside patio and view of the canal.  The smart house instructions on the iPad were easy to follow. We made breakfast one morning and found the kitchen to be well stocked with pans and other items.<br/><br/>Jim was responsive to our questions and wanted to be sure our stay was a good one. <br/><br/>We highly recommend this place!,location
"This place is like a modern apartment crossed with a day spa. All of the functional things are tip top (great beds, big open kitchen, comfortable living room) but on top of that it has such luxe amenities (GIANT bathtub, fire pit, grill, steam shower). The location is tip top, only 3 blocks from the beach and from the main strip in Marina Del Rey and only a short ride to Venice. Jim's communication was excellent. He answered any and all questions promptly and checked in on us a couple of times just to make sure that our stay was going well. I'd highly recommend this apartment for your LA beachside stay.",location
"Location, location, location! Kelleyâs place was a great getaway for our little family of 3. It had everything we needed.  Having the sand across the street and restaurants within walking distance was great. If your traveling from afar, having access to beach chairs and toys are a plus!  Would definitely stay here again.",location
Very close to beach and many restaurants.,location
"Great stay, amazing location. Our littles had a blast going back and forth from the beach. House had all the basics we needed and Host was super nice!",location
The garage was perfect. A little tight with the alley and trash cans but not the owners fault. Itâs a nice getaway for the kids. Nice neighborhood. Beach across the street. And the price is right. Thank you Kelly,location
Kelley's place was exactly as described. Very convenient location for our little family's trip to the LA area. Very quiet and private. Parking garage was a plus! Will be looking forward to staying here again if we are in the area. Thanks again Kelley!,location
"Location was superb, right on the beach, even though we were busy and never visited it, but there were a lot of restaurants within a block or two minutes of walking, and Kelley is an excellent host.",location
Nice location in front of the beach with all you need when traveling with kids,location
Great space in a great location!,location
"If you want to be in the Marina Del Mar/Venice Beach area, this is the place to be! Jim and Lindsay were prompt and responsive hosts.  The location is perfect.  I had a number of meetings all over greater LA from Studio City to Newport Beach and back again. The area offers great restaurants, all within easy walking distance.  Everything in the place is not only spotless, but top of the line as well. And that steam shower!  I couldnât wit for the end of the day so that I could enjoy that shower!",clean
Great host with good communication. Easy check in and out. Very nice place and would definitely stay there again.,location
Great location. Family friendly. Everything as described. Would return again!,location
Great location! Perfect get away,location
"We enjoyed the location and view from this apartment. The beds were comfortable and we had enough space for the three of us that stayed. However, we did notice the hand soap bottles were half filled with water, as were some cleaning agents (I guess to stretch them). Also, we noticed a few days into our trip that a gas burner had been left on prior to our arrival (we did not use the stove at any time).  Thankfully, we had the windows open the entire week or we could have been seriously injured by the emissions. I did suffer from terrible headaches the first few days. We called the numbers provided after discovering the issue and evacuating the apartment - and were told ""this has never happened before"" but were offered no additional support. We received no follow-up calls or messages of concern. Also, while the instructions do indicate the garage opener is difficult - we had to completely take it apart and put it back together to get it work at all. I am hopeful the owners will invest in a new garage opener.",location
Nice home and perfect get-away,location
"It was really a nice experience living in Jackie's house. The house is cute. It has everything you need! The only imperfection is that there is no heater in the third bedroom, which is a little uncomfortable especially during the cold nights. Overall, we enjoyed a lot. ",location
Jackie could not have been more accomodating. She even had internet installed for us.<br/>Thank you for the use of your beautiful home.<br/>Highly recommended host.,host
Absolutely great place to stay for family. Beautiful beaches and so close to all restaurants within pleasant walking distance. I enjoyed beautiful morning run on Long Beach as well as morning paddling around Naples Island.,location
Jackie's home was beautiful and so honey. It had everything we needed and if we needed anything else she was super fast to respond. We had a wonderful stay! ,clean
Great place. Very modern and well laid out and close to the beach.,location
"The space is exactly as pictured and very comfortable with everything we needed to enjoy evenings at home visiting when we werenât out exploring Venice and beyond. Jim is excellent with communication and a gracious host. The beds are very comfortable, too! Enjoyed our time there very much!",location
"Perfect location, super clean and modern space, and a host that went out of his way to ensure that we had an amazing stay.  Would highly recommend!",clean
"This place is exactly as advertised if not better. Amazing location, wonderful hosts and very spacious bedrooms. Highly recommend!",location
"My son and I were in the LA area to tour colleges.  Jimâs place was the prefect place to stay. Plenty of room for the two of us, with a parking spot included, the beach within walking distance, and good (walkable!) recommendations for coffee and dinners.  The location is close enough to Venice Beach for the lively atmosphere, but far enough away to feel tranquil!",location
We loved Jim's place! It was very relaxing looking out at the canal. The floor plan is excellent. Both bedrooms were very comfortable and private. The kitchen is well equipped and we enjoyed the grill outside. We look forward to our next visit!,location
"Jim and Lindsay know how to design a home. From the steam room, to the patio, to the stereo and heated floors throughout, the attention to detail in this place is excellent.<br/><br/>If you're visiting the Venice area or working at an office in Silicon Beach, this is the perfect place to stay. Close enough to be within walking distance of everything, but just far enough away to avoid the insanity of Venice when you want some peace and quiet at home. You'll feel like a local.<br/><br/>Netflix and Amazon Prime Video are included. There's a fire pit and grill on the patio, stocked and ready to go. The parking space couldn't be more convenient. You've got an unobstructed view and access to the canal, which has a walking path along it. And if you walk along that path for a bit, you'll come upon a market, a bunch of restaurants, some shopping, you name it.<br/><br/>We would happily stay here again.",location
This is a beautiful space with lovely amenities inside and out.  The location is fantastic and itâs very relaxing and scenic.  We had a great time and had zero issues.  Iâd definitely stay here again.,location
Everything about our stay way wonderful!,clean
"Beautiful, quiet spot on the canals...close to everything ...awesome patio and fire pit...comfortable modern home.",location
great spot and stylish digs,location
Great spot and great host! I live in LA and was doing a staycation and this is my favorite location in LA.  Best beach and so peaceful on the canals.,location
"Clean, great location, amazing amenities and a wonderful host. Would highly recommend staying here.",location
Jimâs place was amazing. You canât beat the location. Itâs quiet and very comfortable. The front sliders wouldnât open to the canal which was disappointing because that is part of the reason I booked it. But would definitely stay again.,location
Perfection! This home had everything you need. Very clean. Safe and quiet neighborhood. Beach just a short walk away. 10/10 would stay again!,clean
"This place is amazing and the host Azmina is a wonderful person. If your going to California anytime soon you should stay here! We will be back!  As we drove out of the canyons the morning we left I was so inspired and recharged. Everywhere you look the view is breathtaking of Malibu beaches and the canyons. In the morning your way above the fog rolling off the ocean, you have a full view of this.  The back patio is like another world with relaxing daybeds, full tables and chairs and the pool was perfect. At night we sat around the outdoor fireplace relaxing on a comfortable couch. We had a family dinner gathering with ample space and the kitchen was perfectly suited for cooking big meals. Children were able to shoot hoops on the basket ball court on the patio. Azmina the owner is an inspiring fashion designer drawing from her Indian roots. The space echoes her style everywhere with an exquisite decorative touch. She actually bought the house from Van Morrison in 1986 and the house has a ton of history you can feel the artistic roots everywhere. She shared many stories with us and showed us so much kindness. The house was immaculate and had everything you need as far as amenities and anything you would need for your experience. Topanga is a magical place to recharge. Basically I can't say enough about how great this place is ",location
"The place was good for me and my daughter. The location was great for all the activities we did and Kelly was really responsive and helpful, which is very important to me. It was nice to already have beach stuff there, which was a big plus!  I really enjoyed having a designated parking space, although is was very tight.",location
"This location was everything, I do think some updates need to be done but nobody cared and we had fun. My son is two and loved going to the sand everyday.",location
"From the moment I arrived at the Buddha house I was instantly aware of  it's amazing energy. I had heard about Azmina's place through mutual friends but words simply don't prepare you for the sensory feast that the space provides. It was a last minute decision for me and after I booked it I was worried that I had done something that would add stress to my life. That all changed as soon as I spoke to Azmina. She could not have been more accommodating even offering to shop for me! <br/><br/>Azmina agreed to meet me at the property and her warm greeting immediately took away any reservations I had. When she opened the door I was consumed by her warmth and overwhelmed by the spectacular views. There is no way for pictures to convey the healing energy and beauty of this special property. The house is comfortable and well appointed. I had friends visit and they had a difficult time deciding whether they wanted to sit in the living room, kitchen or on the deck....each having it's own magic! The beds are wonderful and I slept like a baby. <br/><br/>Azmina has obviously put much love into the house, infusing every space with her artistic creativity and warmth. After experiencing the beauty of the sunsets I can see where she gets her inspiration!  <br/><br/>The peaceful environment, stunning views and the comfort of the house topped off by an amazing owner have me wanting more. I highly recommend Azmina's Buddha house as a truly amazing GREAT ESCAPE!!!",location
"I just spent the most magical weekend at this beautiful house! Azmina is an incredible host. She made sure we had everything we could possibly need while also giving us plenty of privacy and space. <br/><br/>The house is very dog friendly! Our little pug loved running around the spacious deck and watching the birds fly by.  We spent nearly the entire weekend lounging around outside. There are so many great spots to relax with a glass of wine and watch the incredible sunsets. Even when the weather wasn't perfect, it was still fascinating to watch the clouds and fog roll in from the ocean.<br/><br/>Some of my favorite design details include the big wooden doors, candles everywhere, beautiful iron balconies and rich fabrics. All of the appliances in the kitchen are top of the line and seem brand new. <br/><br/>This place is truly special. As soon as you enter the property you feel the history and love surrounding you.  Do yourself a favor and book your stay here immediately!",location
"Yes! Amina was wonderful. She was there to greet us, answer any questions we may have and included a very informative binder when we needed more information. She was also available by phone/text throughout our stay. The house is absolutely GORGEOUS and has everything you need for your stay. It feels like home and is the perfect background for a wonderful vacation. We could feel the house's good energy. You must stay here!",location
"Azmina is a very accommodating host. The views from this home are incredible. We felt ""at home"" from the first day. I will be looking for excuses to take a vacation and stay at the Saddle Peak Buddha House.",location
"Buddha House was perfect for a gathering of family assembled from around the country for our son's wedding.  The pictures portrayed the home very accurately, and we felt at home as soon as we arrived.  The setting was wonderful, although don't expect a quick hop back and forth to the grocery store or to go out to dinner!  In our view, that was an asset.  Azmina was very accommodating and helpful.  We hope to return for the Year 1 Anniversary!",location
"We loved staying at Jackie's!! She was there when we arrived and got us all settled. The house is completely adorable and well appointed. It's obvious that she takes great care in maintaining it. Light and bright, with everything we needed to feel comfortable. My favorites were the deep soaking tub, the amazingly huge jade plants in the backyard, and the comfy couch and big TV! The patio leading out in to the very private backyard was a lovely added bonus. The master bed was extremely comfortable, especially the pillows! Ample parking space and super convenient location. Grocery store was just up the road and the convention center was less than a 10 min. drive. We would definitely recommend this house to anyone!",clean
Jackie was very responsive and accommodating.  The house is absolutely lovely and has a wonderful set up for family gatherings or outdoor entertaining. Conveniently located to downtown Long Beach and the 710 freeway.  Beautiful master bath and master bedroom. ,location
It was a pleasure being in this house. Everything was near by and it is located in good and safe area where you can go to Lon Beach downtown in short period of time (less than 10 minutes).<br/>The house is spacious and gorgeous it has a private parking which it was life saver and a front and a back yard that we enjoyed.<br/>The rooms are clean and well taking care of.<br/>,clean
This place was perfect for our Long-Beach stay! Absolutely beautiful and as pictured. Jackie made us feel very welcome and was available via text for any questions we had.,location
"Jackie's place was great! Very roomy and loved drinking our morning coffee out on the patio. The location was perfect, close to the 710 and just a few blocks down from the Grand Prix which is what we came down for. Would definitely stay here again. ",location
Jackies home was perfect for us as a home away from home for the week. Everything was what I expected and more. Very easy to make yourself at home and feel comfortable. My family and I would only want to stay here for any future visits. Jackie was very prompt with any questions I had and checked in with us the first morning we were there to make sure all was okay. Very nice lady. I recommend this home to anyone! ,clean
The house was everything we had hoped for. It was large enough to accommodate 10 people without feeling uncomfortably cramped. The only problem was we couldn't use the washer and dryer unless it was for linens Because of how many people were in the house. ,clean
"Jackie as a host was great, left a key for us to let ourselves in and was very accommodating in the fact we had some flexibility on arrival time. The listing was very accurate and the neighbourhood was very quiet and never any noise at night. ",clean
"The house was perfect for the 5 of us. Located close to the Convention Center and other downtown places along with easy access to all the major freeways. Though we didn't spend much time at the house, when we did, it felt like home and much better than a hotel room.",location
"Jackie's place was exactly as advertised!  The house may appear small from the street, but it is in fact quite large front to back and was more than comfortable for my group of six.  We fell in love with the pictures and the real thing did not disappoint.  The master bathroom is gorgeous and all of the bedrooms have plenty of space for couples.  The back yard is quite large and extremely cozy!<br/><br/>It is close enough to the 710 Freeway that most all places are readily accessible depending on traffic.  The only real parking is on the street, as there are a few vehicles already stored in the driveway, but we didn't have any issue finding parking for our three vehicles.<br/><br/>The best thing about the whole trip, though, was how responsive Jackie was to our inquiries.  We were in constant communication leading up to the trip and Jackie even checked in on us via e-mail that first day to ensure we had everything we needed.<br/><br/>It was a terrific long weekend and we would definitely recommend her property to those in the future!",location
"I have rented many times with Airbnb, by far this was the best experience I ever had. The property is spectacular and the host is most professional and welcome. There is no other option when travelling to LA that I would say it's better than Francis and her properties",location
Jackie was a great host. She was quick to respond to any questions that came up before and during the stay. <br/><br/>The house was great. Lots of space! The backyard is also spacious as well. <br/><br/>,location
"lovely house, comfortable And clean.",clean
I booked this on behalf of my new in-laws for our wedding weekend and they were so impressed! The house itself was beautiful and perfect for their needs as a family of 5. The backyard was great as it was furnished with couches and dining tables which allowed for some nice outdoor lounging. It was exactly what we were looking for as an alternative to a small hotel. ,location
"Azmina and Vinda were extremely welcoming, pleasant and helpful.<br/>The photos and description of the house are more than accurate.  This is an amazing house with great vibes.  I live in Los Angeles and my daughter was coming from New York City with her baby so I wanted a serene and beautiful place near the ocean.  This house was much more than I could have ever expected.  I felt like I was at home.  Everything needed to cook is provided for you.  The rooms are very comfortable and dining outdoors was sublime!   The Buddha house is the place to stay!!!",location
We called ahead to say we would be arriving early which Azmina said would not be a problem. Azmina was there to greet us and to show us around the property and give us some local tips on facilities and activities.,location
"Azmina was a wonderful host and made us feel very welcome. The home boasts excellent views over the coast and offers a great deal of privacy.<br/><br/>It's a spacious home and for those who want to get into the spiritual 'zone' this place is perfect.<br/><br/>However, when we arrived, we were informed the previous occupants had blocked one of the downstairs bathrooms. This was not fixed during the stay and therefore was out of bounds. <br/><br/>Given we paid to rent the whole property, we would have expected this to have been fixed. Also, we couldn't get the downstairs shower to work (though we did say to Azmina that this wasn't an issue for our stay as we used the other shower) and like some areas of the property, maintenance is required (door nets slide off their hinges etc).<br/><br/>There were also ants crawling out of the fittings on both the upstairs and downstairs shower.<br/><br/>The air conditioning is based on ceiling fans not air con units. We experienced a very hot week and whilst the fan the living room kept us comfortable, sleeping in the master bedroom was very uncomfortable. In cooler weather this will not be an issue but if you are expecting air con, you may be warm!<br/><br/>There was a cleaning fee. To be honest, I cannot see where this money is entirely spent. The master bedroom carpet (at the top of the stairs) is brown with dirt and the decking furniture also stained. When we arrived there were copious amounts of dead leaves on the seat covers on the deck and children's goggles in the bottom of the pool. I certainly wouldn't let my home out this way.<br/><br/>I overheard the manager's wife commenting to the property manager that he should ""really clean that pool"".<br/><br/>The food cupboards were sticky with dirt.<br/><br/>It breaks me to make this review because Azmina is such a lovely person, but given the strict cancellation policy and the experience of other Air properties, I felt this should be mentioned. <br/><br/>The stay wasn't spoiled, but we were left disappointed that what could be a beautiful holiday let has been left in some neglect. ",location
"We had a wonderful stay at the Buddha House.  Azmina made every effort to ensure our comfort, from leaving fresh Pico de Gallo upon our arrival, to purchasing bread, fruit and cheese to welcome use.  She additionally checked in with us by text on a daily basis just to make sure we had everything we needed.  The setting is undeniably breathtaking and transportive for anyone looking to get off the grid.  We were composed of 2 families: 5 kids and 4 adults total.  The accommodations were spacious enough for all.  We hiked, rode horseback, spent time at the beach, and relaxed by the pool.  On the last day we were notified the power would be going out (construction nearby) at 9 am.  Azmina was kind enough to both warn us, and offer to let us stay through the afternoon rather than leave at the usual 11 am check out time.  We didn't take advantage, but I appreciate her kind gesture to make up for the inconvenience.",location
"I really enjoyed my stay at Saddle Peak. It had tremendous views and was very spacious home. We slept three very comfortably. The home is about 2400 feet in the mountains with a clear view of the Pacific. The drive is a little tricky, but in my opinion worth the effort. I found Azmina a gracious host. Had no issues. Highly recommend. ",location
"This property is just stunning. It's set high up in the Topanga hills and has a large terrace overlooking the hills and the oceans. It's ideal for sitting out and enjoying the sunset. The drive up the hill feels a little long the first few times you do it and there are no amenities close by, but it's completely worth it for being in such a beautiful and tranquil setting. Azmina was also a wonderful host; we'd had a long drive down from SF and she was there to meet us and show us around the property. She'd also provided all the essentials (coffee, milk, bread, cheese) so we could focus on relaxing right away. As a bonus, she'd also prepared some homemade vegan snacks for us for when we arrived which were just delicious. This property is a must visit for a peaceful and relaxing few days.",location
the house was perfect for our extended family  with many places to hang out on the wonderful deck.<br/>Azmina was charming and so helpful.<br/>we  will be back !!,location
"Dear Azmina,<br/><br/>you are a wonderful host with a great heart and you left us wanting for nothing. Your place is truly magic, full of passion, good vibes and energy. The stunning outdoor area with the fire place, the pool, the breathtaking view were kind of paradise for us. We enjoyed cooking in the large kitchen and sitting at the long table with family & friends. It felt like home. <br/><br/>Thank you so much for this golden October!<br/><br/>We would love to come back as soon as possible.<br/>Love & peace.<br/>",location

Azmina made us feel most welcome in her lovely home which is just as shown in the photos. The house is incredibly unique in it's style and history. <br/><br/>Azmina was very responsive to all of our questions and made great recommendations for the local things to do and see.  <br/><br/>I would highly recommend staying here again. ,location
Azmina was in contact with us and consistently available.  She showed up when she said she would and even sent her son over the next day with more gas for the grill.  She left us snacks to get started and plenty of firewood. <br/>The place was spectacular and we were lucky to get it.,clean
"My husband and I plus two other bike friends needed a three bedroom two bath house to stay at for our self supported bike rides in the Malibu Canyons. This house suited us perfectly.  Centrally located on Saddle Peak Road, we were able to easily access all the good bike routes for our rides.  From the house one can ride variations of Stunt, Piuma, Scheuren, Mulholland, Old Topanga, Fernwood Pacific and back up to Saddle Peak.  We also drove to starting points for Latigo Canyon loops, Decker and Yerba Buena.  <br/><br/>The house itself is beautifully furnished and the kitchen is well stocked with extra staples to make meals.  Azmina left us freshly made salsa, bread and cheeses, along with a huge bowl of mandarin oranges and a basket full of snacks!  There are plenty of dishes and cookware to use plus an outdoor grill that works perfectly. <br/><br/>The view of the Pacific from the large deck is  fantastic. There is an abundance of outdoor seating.  We really enjoyed coming back, jumping into the cool pool and then enjoying the deck until dinner time.  The pool is not heated but perfect after long rides to cool off our muscles!  <br/><br/>Our beds were comfortable and there were plenty of towels to use.  The house was very clean and tidy.  <br/><br/>The evenings are so quiet up there!  We loved star gazing and even enjoyed the antics of howling coyotes periodically heard during the night.  <br/><br/>I'm missing this place already and can't wait to go back!  Most definitely we all will have fond memories of our bike week.  My friend's wife saw pictures and thinks it would be a perfect setting for her weaving group.  ",location
The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.,clean
"Azmina is the most gracious hostess!  When my family arrived at her home, she had snacks (bread, cheese, treats for our girls) waiting for us, which was a very pleasant surprise.  Her home is amazing!  It's well laid out and has everything that you can possibly need for your stay.  The kitchen is fully stocked, with cupboards full of spices and oils and every kind of kitchen utensil and gadget imaginable.  We were able to settle in right away and make ourselves at home.  There were fresh flowers in nearly every room.  But the real gem of this house is right out the back doors.  The decks overlook the mountains and have the most incredible view of the Pacific.  There are many cozy places to sit, and a pool that my kids spent the entire week in.  Gelson's is about 15 minutes away, to load up on groceries, and the drive up to the house is stunning.  It's quiet and relaxing and exactly the peaceful retreat that we were looking for.  We will absolutely be booking again at the Buddha House.",clean

This house was perfect for my weekend in long beach .. didnt spend much time during the day but the house was wonderful. The bathroom was my favorite part of the house aside from the kitchen.

Very clean house. Amazing host.,clean
"A great host as well as such a sweet woman. Considerate, responsive and accommodating. Very clean and modern place.",clean
Donât trust the word of this host. When they say itâs okay to have people over and then kick you out and comes into the house without permission all the time is ridiculous. I had 0 chance to clean or get notice that she was going to be there.<br/>Privacy was invaded. She looks at cameras inside and outside the house. Never new truly if I was by myself in the house. Kind of unfair to come to an agreement to have people be able to come over and then not giving me an opportunity to clean it. Couldâve spent my 30k at much better places.,host
Frances is an amazing host! She went above and beyond to make sure her beautiful property was ready for our arrival. The house is absolutely stunning and we had the most amazing stay! Thank you again Frances for being so accommodating !,host

We stayed at the Buddha House with other members of our family so that we could all be together to attend a family wedding in Malibu. The house was spacious, and the setting was fabulous.  Only on the last two days we were there did we get a chance to unwind and really enjoy the home and setting.

If you are looking to relax and have time go slowly, this is the place. The inside is incredible too. Each corner of the home has its own unique and distinct character. The couch and beds are very comfortable. I had not had such a good nights sleep until I stayed there. The host, Azmina is also very attentive and generous. She really came through when we needed her. I'm looking forward to going back. ",location

Enjoyed the backyard having morning breakfast. Definitely a home that the owner takes great pride in.  Only drawback is that it is not in an area if you are looking to hang in neighborhood, do shopping,eating or walking. Great home if you will be out for the day and looking to come back home to relax with family in a lovely home.  Jackie was a great host.  She was always accessible and got back to you immediately if you had a question.",host

You can easily walk to the pool at Santa Monica College (it is public) and get a taste of a SM tradition, Grey Block Pizza is right around the corner. And be sure to hit the Daily Pint up the street for a famous selection of whisky and beers. Oh yea, and the beach is 1.5 miles away! ",clean

The experience was a right balance of meeting others and feeling at home for my brief stay in LA, and I would definitely go back!",clean
"Akiko was very kind and welcoming. The room and bed was exactly how she described it on the listing. It was nice to meet the other guests on the first night. We had our own mini Airbnb party that night exploring the Santa Monica beach and pier area. Hopefully, we didn't disturb Akiko or the other guests too much by coming back to the room so late every night... This is my first Airbnb experience, and I'm very impressed with it. If I'm ever in the area again, I will definitely stay at Akiko's house again.",clean
My experience was great staying here. A great location in Santa Monica that is close to everything! It was really nice having your own parking spot and not worrying where to park your car. Akiko was extremely nice and welcoming. I recommend this place to everyone!,location

The next time I'm in Santa Monica, I plan to visit Akiko and ChaCha again :)",clean
It's a wonderful house. And host is really nice and friendly ,clean
"Akiko was very welcoming! House was clean and in a good neighborhood. The other tenants were very polite and Akiko was happy to provide household items such towels, iron, ironing board etc. my only concern was that there was a slight smell, I think from a cherry scented air freshener. I personally am a bit sensitive to scents so it may just be me, but other than that it was a great stay. ",clean

Otherwise, a very nice stay. ",location
Definitely recommend this place . Had an amazing time staying here.,location
"This home is lovelier in person. The pictures do not do it justice. Five minutes away from Long Beach Convention Center. Quiet neighborhood. We brought our own towels, coffee and inflatable mattress. However, Jackie provided the all of that for us.  She also made sure that each room had closet space for our clothes. We would definitely stay again next year! ",location
"My family and I stayed here for a total of (5) days for a family vacation. When we had booked this place we were unsure about the grandkids coming with us so we had put (9) adults because that's what was expected. Turned out their were some changes the day of which we had mentioned to the owner the next morning. My family and I felt their was no problem that my nieces and nephew (ages 7-9) were staying with us due to the fact it was a ""family vacation"". That was when Jackie saw on her camera that their were kids in her backyard and had racked on an extra 240.00 to our already 1400.00 trip for three kids in replace of the one adult that did not end up showing up. We thought that was a extremely high amount for the kids, so we had offered her 150.00 instead of the initial price. She then replied completely rude and unprofessional about the amount that we had offered and unfortunately made us feel uncomfortable. We had paid her the amount she ""needed"" so that we can go on with our vacation without any hiccups. As for the house, it was clean and uptight. The backyard was upkept except for the piles of which looked like dog poop in the grass. I will say that the front door to the home was a little frustrating you shouldn't have to literally put your back into the door for it to open. One of the bedroom doors you couldn't shut all the way or else you would get locked in. Like I had mentioned earlier, she did have a camera in the backyard which I thought was a complete invasion of our privacy. A lot of us didn't feel comfortable outside due to the fact that their was someone watching us through a camera. Other than those things, we had a great time in Longbeach. The home was close to the freeway as well to local shops and restaurants. The beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms had very nice decor, a large driveway to fit a good amount of cars as well as a comfortable seatin area in the backyard.  ",clean
Stunning and spectacular views of the Pacific Ocean- a very special place. Azmina was kind and helpful. Highly recommend. ,location
"The Buddha house is a peaceful relaxing place to stay with unforgettable views of the canyon with the ocean beyond. We enjoyed Sunsets and beautiful quiet moments stargazing on the  expansive, colorful outdoor areas with adjoining pool with plenty of comfortable seating. Azmina and Sasha were warm and welcoming and shared many stories of the home's famous history along with suggestions for activities and restaurants. We loved this place!",location
This house is amazingly cozy and inviting! The view is unreal and it felt like you were coming home every day. We would definitely stay there again! ,location
"This house is what dreams are made of. It is even more gorgeous and expansive than the pictures, and Azmina is an incredible person and host. The views, the pool, the deck furniture, the outdoor fireplace, and just the overall energy of this place are truly healing and rejuvenating. Thank you, Azmina! ",location

"The Budha house is wonderful.  We were in LA for our son's wedding and this was home base for us for a week.  We so enjoyed the beautiful and comfortable deck and views.

"The house and location is stunning!<br/>Communication with Azmina was superb and immediate. <br/>We stayed with 3 children (9, 10 and 16) and everyone just loved the place including the nice pool. <br/>Would definitely stay here again",location
"We stayed at Azmina's place for a girls weekend and the ambiance could not have been more tranquil. The outdoor area is unbeatable! I will say you are definitely one with nature out here as there is a lot of wildlife (some mice scratching at the door / windows at night). We had some issues with bugs (ants and cobwebs/spiders). We were told the ants were due to seasonality since we visited during a hot month. Also, I would definitely recommend hiring a car service if you don't rent one as it's quite a bit up in the hills! We were able to get Lyft to pick us up (not Uber), but it was inconsistent and takes them 30-45min to get to you typically. Azmina communicated with us the entire time and was very helpful with any questions we had.",location
My family loved every bit of our stay at Azmina's house.   The kids spent hours in the pool everyday and we basically lived out on the spacious deck with the amazing view!,location
Wonderfull home with a gorgeous view and a spacious outdoor area. We loved the home !,location
"When I booked Azmina's home I did so because I was looking for a home that would allow me and my wife's family to enjoy California. What I didn't know is that is that Azmina's home would host such a transformational moment in my family's life. My son John was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder just days before our trip. While the diagnosis was not entirely unexpected, it was devastating nonetheless.<br/><br/> Azmina's home in Topanga served as an ideal place for me to reconcile the journey that lay ahead. I used the days at Azmina's home to take stock of my life and to read about my son's condition. The peace and tranquility of Topanga Canyon, and of Azmina's home, is unrivaled. I spent hours reading on her expansive deck about how my son thought, and how to best help him. I used the serenity Azmina's home to best understand how to become a better father to my son. I can honestly say that our stay at Azmina's home was a transformational experience. What an amazing home!<br/><br/>Azmina was at all times just a text or phone call away. She knew the correct balance between attentive host and allowing us the privacy we desired. I left her home a better person than I arrived, and it was absolutely worth every penny.",location

She always had fresh towels out, and also kept fresh fruit and water available for those staying with her. She was very kind and considerate and talked to me about my trip and good things to do in the area. Her dog Cha-Cha was just as wonderful!

Thank you!<br/>The room is quite large and right off of the kitchen and on the path to the shared bathroom.  There is a private entrance to the backyard.  One wall of the room is nearly floor to ceiling windows so the temperature at night during my stay was quite chilly, something to consider when packing. This was a busy airbnb with other guests during my stay and the walls are thin, you can hear everything.  If you are a lighter sleeper I recommend ear plugs. ",location

"Akiko was one of the best hosts we've ever had. She was so nice and gave us lots of useful informations. The room was very beautiful, clean and comfortable. The beach is close and there are also a lot of buses. Ou, and Akikos dog is also very cute! We can definitely recommend this place!",clean

"I went to LA on business with the thought of taking a couple extra days for relaxing. I stayed at another BnB for the first two days, it was fine. But my stay w/ Akiko was far above my expectations. Akiko is an exceptional host. She is warm and friendly and truly makes you feel at home. <br/><br/>While there I made friends with a couple of her other guests who live in Europe; I expect we may be friends for life. As for Akiko, I simply cannot say enough good things about her! I lost my mother 17 years ago and I haven't felt so at home in a stranger's house since. When I return to LA, Akiko will always be my first choice for lodging!! ",host

She was very kind and understanding when my travel plans changed and I arrived later than expected, and even helped make sure I could park off-street. Her come is immaculate, and my room was just wonderful - airy, spacious, comfy bed. I highly recommend Akiko's place - it's a lucky traveler that finds themselves staying with her!",clean
This stay was exactly what I wanted- a clean safe place with a clean bathroom and flexible host. I stayed 3 nights and loved my private room. There were 3 other guests who were all lovely and I saw them around meals if I was at the house. Quite a long walk to the beach but I did the walk two days. Akiko wa a lovely and respectful. She even left fruit and water in each room!,clean

"Azminaâs Buddha house is such a lovely place with plenty of room for our small family of three. Thereâs is a strong sense of creativity and personality embedded in her home which made us feel very much at home. <br/><br/>The huge outdoor deck which includes a beautiful pool and several little nooks set up for relaxing is facing breathtaking views of the mountains and the Pacific Ocean! Unfortunately we were there in February so it was a bit too cold to make the most of the outdoor facilities.<br/><br/>We would love to come back at a time where the weather allows for hanging by the pool.  <br/><br/>Azmina is a wonderful host and went above and beyond to make our stay perfect. She even filled the kitchen with plenty of fruit, snacks and beverages before our arrival which was really precious after our long drive from our previous destination. <br/><br/>If youâre ever looking for a place to stay near LA, and wish to be surrounded by beautiful nature we warmly recommend staying with Azmina at the Buddha House :)",location
"Spectacular doesn't begin to cut it.  The space is perfection - huge couches, big kitchen, multiple bedrooms - the ideal space for our group of six.  I can't go on enough about that outdoor deck though, insane views of the mountains and ocean and sky.  We ended up changing a chunk of plans just to stay back there and enjoy the gazillion options to lay out.  Azmina was also so wonderful about answering all my questions in a really timely manner and providing so many suggestions for the area. It was so hard to leave and I'd love to go back!",location
What a magical house! An incredible view!! Peaceful and cosy. Azmina made so many special touches and thoughtful things. Thank you!,location

Not only did she leave a huge basket of snacks and food for us to enjoy upon our arrival (the house is quite removed from civilization), she was super communicative and the views were more beautiful than the pictures. We enjoyed a fire in the outdoor fireplace and made lovely lifelong memories. Thank you for sharing your slice of heaven with the world, Azmina!",location
We had an absolutely amazing time in Azminaâs peaceful retreat.  Her home is truly something special to experience.  She was very easy to communicate with and provided many amenities to help make our stay extra special.  The remoteness of the home made for breath taking views but also means that nature is present as well :).  We would absolutely recommend!,location
"Azmina is a wonderful host and the house is beyond beautiful! We had so much fun in the pool during the heat wave and the patio area is amazing. She had great suggestions for local attractions and the house was furnished and stocked with a lot of thought for the guestsâ comfort. There was one issue that were out of Azminaâs control, but her response was immediate and the issue was resolved. Thank you for the wonderful stay! We will definitely keep the Buddha house in mind for our next trip to California.",location

"Azmina's place is a true escape.  Suggest you come prepared with all your provisions,  as you won't want to leave once you arrive.  We prepared gourmet meals, enjoyed the deck and pool the entire time we were there.  We only ventured out our last night into Malibu for a celebratory meal.",location

"What a fabulous experience! Akiki's house is immaculate, comfortable and truly a home away from home! The bed was  comfortable, the room spacious with a big closet and plenty of bureau drawers.  And what a prime location for navigating Santa Monica and the LA area: busses run from the corner to the Pier and downtown, and the Metro Expo Line is an easy 15 minute walk (Website hidden by Airbnb) A few words about Akiki...what a LOVELY host in every sense of the word.  She understands the little touches that make a stay special: fresh flowers in unexpected spots, different breakfast selections, plenty of accessible clean towels.  Truly one of the nicest, hospitable women I've met.  Thank you so much Akiki!",location

What can I say. Azmina's house is true piece of heaven. If you love waking up every morning like you are sleeping in the clouds you have found the right place. We felt a million miles away from Los Angeles. Azmina greeted us and made us feel welcomed the moment we arrived. You couldn't ask for a kinder and thoughtful  host. The house is true reflection of her creativity and hospitality for others. Place was stocked with everything you need from the kitchen to the bedrooms.

She had got us nut milks as requested as we weren't sure if we would make it to the shop on the first day or not. The place was amazing - a colleague and I came for work purposes and had its of creative ideas whilst in the energy of the house.

"STOP! Look no further and stay here!  Akiko is a kind, thoughtful and gracious host.  Just ask and she can help with anything.  Here are some of the things she did for me: (1) I had a ""laundry emergency"" and she let me do my wash, (2) gave me an ironing board and iron to use, (3) fixed the most wonderful soup and shared with me, (4) left the driveway for me to park in when I arrived late, (5) was very welcoming for me and my dog after a long day of moving, AND (6) she helped me move my things in AND (7) allowed me to leave my heavy suitcase there between stays.  I can't recommend staying here enough.  Thank you, Akiko and Cha Cha (her sweet dog).  Already booked another stay!  Also, I need to mention that I normally don't stay where there isn't a private bathroom but her 2 shared baths are constantly cleaned and it was actually just perfect. So no need to worry about that - you can book any room in her home and be completely comfortable and cared for.  Finally, her home has a very high quality air filtration system and her water is ""Kanga water""! This was really important to me as I am healing from an illness. Staying here is like a wellness retreat so if it's available, book now! You won't be disappointed.",host

"Azminaâs place was a slice of heaven for us. We stayed for 6 wonderful days. From the moment we arrived, we felt pampered and well taken care of. The view from the deck is amazing, not to mention the deck itself, and all of the comfy places to sit and lay. Everything and more was provided for our stay. We truly felt spoiled. After days of running around doing vacation stuff, we couldnât wait to get back to the Buddha house. From sitting around the deckâs fire pit sipping a cocktail, lounging on the comfy couch with a fire going, BBQing, or just sitting out watching the hawks soar overhead, our stay was absolutely amazing! All amenities and more were available. Bathrooms were very well stocked, kitchen had organic snacks, and firewood was available for fires. Very rarely in life, do you meet a person like Azmina. We feel so blessed to have gotten to know her and spend time with her. (And Ziggy) To us, she was not only a host but we felt like we were leaving a family memberâs house when we had to leave. Our stay, our time with Azmina, and everything we enjoyed at the Buddha house will live in our minds and hearts forever. If I could give it 10 stars, I would!",location
This place was amazing I have no complaints I would stay here there again,location
"Nice place. Secluded and nice views. You are in nature, so be ready for bugs both inside and outside the home.",location
"Buddha house does not disappoint! Spectacular view, peaceful environment, a perfect place to reconnect with old friends.<br/><br/>Azmina is fabulous. Thoughtful gestures, great tips, an A+ experience all around.",location
"Our stay at the Buddha House was fantastic. If you are looking for a peaceful place to getaway, relax and feel inspired then this home is definitely it. Azmina is a wonderful person and host who made us feel very welcome and at home. The location with its panoramic view over the mountains to the pacific ocean was breathtaking and it was very hard for us to say goodbye!",location
Azmina is great and quick to respond when you need her. The views are amazing and the space is huge. Perfect place for a getaway!,location
"We are a family of 5, with 2 teenagers and a 12 year-old, who have just spent 3 weeks driving around California. We finished up with 4 days at the Buddha House.<br/><br/>We all loved this house. It was, by a comfortable margin, the best accommodation we had in California. It was such a pleasant place to stay during the afternoons and evenings that we were reluctant to leave it for the sights of LA. The views down to the sea, and of the sunset are magnificent. When the sun goes down a collection of scattered solar-powered lamps gently sparkle into life around you on the deck, to mirror the stars overhead.<br/><br/>The house is situated pretty much on top of a hill, almost 3,000 ft above the Pacific at Malibu. Regardless of which direction you come from, you'll approach it by steep winding roads through the Santa Monica Mountains. There are neighbouring houses, but the Buddha House feels peaceful and secluded. It is hard to believe that the city of LA is only half an hour away, as this tranquil mountain home in the sky gives nothing away.<br/><br/>While we were staying the weather was much better at the Buddha House than down in Malibu, or in the city. On more than one day the whole Pacific coast was covered in a layer of dense cloud, while we basked in the sun, hundreds of feet above. <br/><br/>The interior is spacious, with a big living room and a nice kitchen. The main bedroom is lovely, with lots of room. But the external areas, in particular the decking, are the real highlights. There are plenty of seating areas overlooking the mountains and sea, so you can always find the shade, or the sun if you wish. You'll be surrounded by statues, pot plants and decorative lamps. The pool is small but the water is clean, clear and refreshing.<br/><br/>This is not be the house for someone craving ultra-sharp modern monochromatic minimalism. It is warm and welcoming, hippyish and lived-in. In places the paint is peeling on the decking, and it is probably some time since the bathrooms were installed. But it is clean and airy. The kitchen and bathroom facilities, external gas BBQ, WiFi, TVs, and clothes washing & drying machines all worked well.<br/><br/>Azmina is a lovely host. She welcomed us upon arrival, and had bought in some snacks, fruit and other provisions beforehand. She responded very quickly to any questions that we had. She clearly loves the house and wants her guests to enjoy it too!",location
"Amazing house, pool, panoramic view, host and general location.  We had an amazing couple of weeks at Azminaâs place who could not have been a better host.  There is such a variety of things to do in the wider LA area and the house was such a relaxing place to be in that our only regret was not booking for longer.",location
"The Buddha House is the most peaceful and wonderful place to stay. We will be back next year, most definitely.",location
"We had a great stay at Azmina's place. The view from the house is absolutely amazing and the pictures doesn't do it justice.<br/><br/>The hospitality was great, Azmina always answered quickly when we had any questions and also gave us local tips about where to go nearby. <br/><br/>We came here to end our road trip with a few days of relaxation and the place is absolutely perfect for that.",location
"Azmina was by far the most âsuperâ super host iâve ever had the pleasure of meeting. Sheâs made the already historic & magical space into a home filled with thoughtful & beautiful detail, will 1000% come back as soon as I can.",clean
"Beautiful views, warm and comfortable space,  very spacious patio and outdoor area.  Azmina was a very nice and helpful host.  Would definitely recommend this Airbnb.  Only disappointment was the hot tub being non operational.",location
"Wonderful place for a long weekend in Topanga, with a magnificent view of the canyon and Pacific ocean from the hillside house and its huge, wonderfully furnished outdoor space that never ends. The interior is striking with large rooms, oversized  comfortable furniture, antiques, art and beautiful fabrics.  Probably the best provisioned house weâve ever stayed in, with all the bathroom products, towels, linens and warm throws that you would ever need, the latter coming in very handy at the outdoor fireplace.  The kitchen is also well supplied in cookware,  dishes, etc., plus cooking staples, a  welcome basket of snacks, fruit, eggs, half and half and beverages. Also warm cookies over the weekend!<br/>Azmina is a truly exceptional (and interesting) host, quick to respond to inquiries, with great suggestions for the area.",location
"The Buddha House was the peaceful retreat we needed! Besides the breathtaking views, Azmina's accommodations were outstanding. She provided us with snacks, cheese, crackers and ample cooking supplies, in addition to coffee and tea. Body wash/lotion/shampoo and conditioner are also provided. We had a great time grilling and enjoying the sunset after hiking in Topanga. Like others mentioned it's about a 15 minute drive up the mountains so plan on buying your food for cooking/grilling ahead of time. We could not have asked for more in this home and can't wait to stay here again. Thanks Azmina and Marshall :)",location
This is a great place to take in the beauty of Topanga National Park. We didn't stay long enough to fully embrace the outdoors as much as we'd hoped to (it rained on one of the days!) but still made it our home for a nice dinner with friends and chill times by the log fire. It's the perfect place to escape the hustle of LA and to recharge the batteries.,location
"We simply loved this place. An utterly unique experience, high above LA, and exceptional place. We're looking forward to visiting again.",location
"Azmina's home is a magical place! My husband, in-laws, and our two daughters had such a wonderful time spending a long weekend there. The views and the deck are breathtaking! The kitchen is incredibly well stocked with supplies and spices. The house is beautifully furnished, comfortable, with everything we needed.  There are many lovely hikes nearby. We loved it there and hope to be back soon!",location
Incredible facility and views !!!,location

"Previous to our arrival, I rescheduled a time of meeting few minutes before our promised due to an event. Leona was very easy to commute with and she accepted our schedule changes. When we came late, Leona and her husband were waiting at the house. The home is a remodeled and upgraded town home with new hard wood floor - very Asian style and would be connivence for tourists coming from China like us and it just made us feel like home. Rooms are more spacious than we expected. Cleanness can be scored 10/10 because our host, Leona just spent all the day to make the cleanness of home with luxury hotel standard. Beside, a brand new set of washer and dryer is just equipped, and easy for moms to handle the laundry. The kitchen was equipped and the house also have a small patio and another excess to outside of the villa. It also have a cable TV with all the Chinese channels. Far East Chinese Market is just right at the corner, and close to the school district. Another thing I gonna share is about the location - it is just less than 10 minutes to drive to Gale Ave, Rowland Heights, where lots of Chinese Market and dinner place locates. I will plan to stay in Leona's villa for my parents and friend's visiting and this place is highly recommended.",clean

It was a great place to stay and if I return to Long Beach, Iâd definitely try to stay there again!!!  Two thumbs up!",location
Jackieâs property was amazing! There was more than enough room for our party of 10 adults. Jackie responded to me very quickly when I had questions.

"The short version:<br/>Excellent; Outstanding; First-rate! I want to move in permanently!<br/><br/>The no so short version:<br/>The property is gorgeous; ample and comfortableâ¦ by the second day we were used to it and feeling at home; you become very attached to the place; many plans were changed or canceled in order to pass more time at home, to enjoy the place as much as we could.<br/><br/>They have an excellent kitchen; extremely comfortable beds; great bathrooms and a beautiful pool.<br/><br/>The views are spectacular; you are at the top of Topanga; from the massive deck on the back, you see a wonderful view of the hills into Malibu and the ocean; clean you phone memory before going, this is a selfie paradise! Every corner of this home is a beautiful picture.<br/><br/>The environment is stunning; our favorite moment of the day was having breakfast on the many outside furniture options; with the sun coming up at your back and only listening to birds; this is something we will immensely miss; coming from a busy city, it had been a long time since we âenjoyed the silenceâ; we had forgotten. <br/><br/>Sunsets and more sunsets! Each one of them different and wonderful. <br/><br/>And later at nightâ¦ I really canât remember the last time I looked up and saw so many beautiful stars.<br/><br/>The best part? The host! <br/>Azmina is a wonderful person; we felt like we were just living nearby a lovely relative; she is attentive; caring and thoughtful; what a wonderful person; you relate to her immediately. <br/>You understand instantly where the great atmosphere of the place comes from; there is so much of her love and care invested in this home.<br/>She just brings light to wherever she is; we wish her the best; and we canât thank her enough for welcoming us into this beautiful home.<br/><br/>Thank you Azmina!!!",location

Beds were very comfortable and we loved having access to private washer and dryer in the unit.  <br/>Leona is a great host.

"From the very beginning of our stay, Azmina was hospitable, informative, welcoming, and so incredibly generous. It felt like she treated us as family and made her home our home for the week. We loved the amazing view, cleanliness, full kitchen but most of all the positive energy that the house emits. 5 of us comfortably stayed in the house with no (Email hidden by Airbnb) ing back is a guarantee!!! Thank you so much Azmina!!!!!",location
"The space is right for a family as it has 3 bedrooms. We feel secure in and out of the gated community because the environment is very quiet and decent. Location is also near malls, grocery stores, etc. Check in and out were both easy. Leona responds immediately so there was no problem with that. The beds were clean and comfortable even the towels were clean and looked new. Kitchen has enough equipment to cook although we used paper plates most of the time because we didnât want to wash. The sala ang dining were simple which we preferred because we had a kid and we didnât want to accidentally break anything so it was just right. The neighborhood is also very quiet. Thanks Leona and looking forward to staying here again.",clean

"First airbnb nightmare! Mice infestation and major ant problem. Mice droppings in kitchen, table tops, floors, chairs, surrounding house rugs. NATURE should not be used as an excuse for this house's problem. I have stayed at many cabins and rural/nature areas and I have never had these problems. Azmina made note of a possible problem, but the problem escalated day after day. Being 4th of july weekend during covid, we knew we had no choice but to stay or drive 6hrs home. We made the best of our stay but don't wish the experience of having to kill half dead mice on the traps or hearing the snap of traps every night. 3 mice died within 72hrs. I would not walk barefoot inside or outside the house or allow children to play on the floor. Mice droppings everywhere! Azmina was welcoming, but that is not enough to salvage the horrifying experience. In my opinion, the house is not habitable, or sanitary in it's current state. I do not believe it was a fluke and until an exterminator is called and the house is sprayed with pesticides this will likely happen at your stay. As a Northern California, I know nature and preventives to keeping it outside. Bait traps inside are no enough. This house has major potential and the view is breath taking, but you will not feel relaxed or zen in it's current state.",clean
"Jackie is a great host! Very responsive and friendly. The place was very clean, great amenities, and perfect location for everything.",clean
Leona was a great host.  She responded very quickly and the directions were very precise.  The home is exactly how it looks in the pictures.  The only thing is that the place needs a good dusting and there was a slight cat smell.  Otherwise itâs a nice place in a great area.  Thanks again Leona!,clean

"Nice gated community. Very quiet. Host was very responsive, even came out the same day to correct a small issue we had. Only 1 tv in the house but had plenty of channels. Rooms were good size and beds were comfortable. Location is great!! Would definitely stay again!",location
"Jackieâs place is perfect for small families or business travelers who donât want to be right on the beach or downtown. Itâs a cozy little place, with a nicely updated kitchen and master bathroom. Thereâs a lot of other parts of the house that need some updating but not that big of a deal. I think for the price you can probably get something similar closer to the beach. The neighborhood wasnât the best, so if you have children Iâd be a little cautious. Overall a pleasant experience.",location

This is truly a place you donât want to leave and just sit poolside and soak in the relaxing and quiet vibes needed to improve mental health outside of LA. <br/>Azmina was so accommodating and quick to respond via text to any questions we had about the home and all itâs epic features.

Azmina left us bday treats and then stopped by to drop off dessert. Such a lovely gesture!

Host was QUICK to respond, very detailed and flexible! The Bad: Pool, which was main reason I chose this listing, is across the courtyard, plus I was not informed it was closed due to COVID! ð¡ It's not really central to LA, unless you're good with driving minimum of 45 to 75 minutes! Community Gate situation is ok, but gets complicated if you have more than one car, need to get dropped off, or have to get deliveries! Patio is a little small, so don't plan to do more than just have 2 or 3 people sit and relax.",location

She was the best host we could ask for and we really appreciated her! <br/><br/>The property was great, was a townhouse community. I wasn't exactly sure what to expect for parking but this is in a gated community, so it has great security. Once in the gate, you drive right up to the private attached double garage, park inside and walk right into the kitchen area. Very fast and easy!<br/><br/>There is a hot tub that we enjoyed very much, it was heated in late December, so running all year I'd say. There was a non heated pool (at least not heated in December) but we did the Minnesota dunk in that ice water for up to a minute before scrambling back to the hot tub again  (gets your heart racing).<br/><br/>The bedrooms were large and comfortable, the kitchen had cooking items (we cooked good breakfasts while there) and everything was nice, clean and comfortable.<br/><br/>We had zero issues, found the property to be very nice for us, and would not hesitate to stay there again!<br/><br/>Thanks Zimi!",location

We were able to get groceries and take out delivered to us and even had food ready upon arrival stocked up in the kitchen thanks for Azmina and her son. The living room is comfortable and spacious, the kitchen has everything you need. We spent most of our time outside on the deck. Even when the sun went down we stayed out there with the fireplace. Plenty of towels and linens. The pool and hot tub arenât heated but we went in anyway, once you heat up in the sun its  not bad.

Amazing spacious home with breath taking views. Fully stocked pantry with more than we ever imagined. Our family had a great experience and we canât wait to come back. Azmina is an incredible host.,location
Our family had a great time! Beautiful house with an even more beautiful view. And our host was so thoughtful and helpful; she even brought us dinner one night. Definitely a place Iâd like to return to.,location
Great stay ! Very nice neighborhood! Only thing that sucked was the parking if you came in two or more cars because you would have to park outside the neighborhood but thatâs not Zimi fault ! Other then that amazing stay !,location
"Zimi's place was nice, clean, and comfortable. The neighborhood was good with some good food options near by. It had everything we needed.",clean
Great spacious and really quiet place. Near to lots of places for food and freeways. You get access to the pool and garage parking.,location
"Great place!   Clean, spacious, excellent amenities and great location!",location
"Great hostess, would stay again",clean
"Zimi is a really good communicator and replied all messages promptly. We arrived after 11 PM and she was still able to open the gate for us remotely right when we arrived. The house location is really quiet, it has a community pool and a hot tub. The house is very clean, itâs very safe as itâs inside a gated community and also in a  safe area. Our family were able to walk or run at night or in the morning, we truly enjoyed our stay!",clean
"The place looked like the pictures on the listing. It was minimally decorated and furnished, as noted in the listing. The beds were super comfortable. Zimi was responsive",clean
Overall great place and great host!,location
"A quaint, older condo with beautiful grounds outdoors. Zimi was quick to respond and even sent her husband to fix a small issue we had with a shower after we addressed it. This was a nonissue for us but the gate did not have a remote access code at the time, so we had to meet anyone entering without the key fob. Otherwise, this was a great offer for itâs price range, especially compared to competitors in the area.",location
"Our group of eight -- three adults and five kids aged 10 to 16 -- enjoyed our four-night stay at Zimi's townhouse.  While the property is a little dated, Zimi was an excellent host and promptly responded to our questions.  The main room, while sparsely furnished, was a comfortable place to congregate, and we enjoyed watching the large TV.  We ate all our meals out, but the kitchen seemed well-equipped.  We particularly appreciated the electric kettle and abundant ice from the refrigerator; together, these features kept us well-supplied with iced tea. The kids had fun in the complex's swimming pool, which we had all to ourselves during the Saturday morning we used it. <br/><br/>What really set this property apart was the location near some fantastic Asian restaurants.  Our favorites included Pick a Poke (Website hidden by Airbnb) Dimsum Box (Website hidden by Airbnb) Pho Vietnam Kitchen (Website hidden by Airbnb)  and Ding Tea (Website hidden by Airbnb)  The highlight of our trip was a visit to Disneyland on Sunday and the commute to Disneyland from the townhouse only took about half an hour.  <br/><br/>We would stay at Zimi's place again!",clean
Location is great for what we were in LA for. The home was very cozy and comfortable. The pool was a perfect plus in the heat. Safe area since it was gated. Host communicated very well and it wasn't too long of a wait if I couldn't contact them right away. I would stay here again!,location
Beautiful place with a gorgeous view and a stunning deck.  So many options of where to relax and enjoy the sunrise and sunset.  Azmina is an amazing host that has thought through all of the details on what would make guests comfortable. Communication was excellent and we felt very well taken care of.  Would return and recommend to others without hesitation.,location
"Azmina's home was inspiring, beautiful, and peaceful. I could not recommend more. She was a great host who was extremely responsive and helpful, but also let us do our own thing. The home was spacious, well kept, and had a view that pictures really can't do justice to. For those looking for a creative retreat or a peaceful resting place, I could not recommend more highly.",location
She is a nice host and willing to help.,clean
"Nelly was the best host, she was there when you needed her but also gave you space.  Her home is beautiful and has a family environment.  My daughter and I felt so comfortable in her home.  I would definitely <br/>stay in her place again. Totally recommend Nelly's place if you are coming to the LA area. <br/>",host
"I would absolutely suggest a trial period first and to get everything agreed upon before and during your stay in writing (email, text...etc). Whether it was misunderstanding or misinformation this stay did not work out for me. I'll spare the hairy details, but know the long cancellation policy, and the hosts unwillingness, makes it nearly impossible to change or cancel if the situation doesn't work out. I would NOT book this stay long term without seeing the home or meeting the host first. The home is beautiful and Nelly was very kind in the beginning, but the house has many other ""tenants"", making little space or privacy, and many rules. That is the best & nicest way I can describe my stay and relay the advice I wish I would have had before booking. ",location
Nelly was great and went out of her way to make my stay comfortable,clean
"Nelly is such a wonderful and thoughtful person! Sheâs a terrific host in a very nice, quiet and comforting house. My stay with her was superb and I couldnât have asked for anyone or any place better.",location
"Nelly is a very warm hearted and caring host, just like my mother. the first night i arrive was a bit late, she knows i couldn't arrange time to supermarket, she cooked the dumplings for me. she invited her friends to her house, she prepared a lot of food, she will leave some food for me too. she sometimes will cook chicken and some snacks for our guests for celebrate a weekend. also we communicate a lot. just like a family. stay with Nelly, you will feel like home. it is a home feeling, very recommended. <br/>bedroom is very comfortable queen size bed, it is clean and the house is quite big, we have a lot of private space.<br/>convenience for shopping in supermarket, walking distance.",host
"This is my second stay at Nelly's home, as usual it was very comfortable. You have a lot of privacy and the house is very beautiful. Nelly is a sweet host and will do her best to accommodate you every time!",location
Iâve extended my stay with Nelly for another month after my first booking and Iâm glad I did! Sheâs been a perfect host throughout the entire stay and I couldnât have asked for a better experience. Thank you!,host
Very stable .....and welcoming.,clean
"This is a very clean, stylish place to stay.  The layout is nice and bright with roomy bedrooms and a tidy ambiance.  It reminded me of a 1940's Hollywood bungalow with a splash of Grandma's house.  The kitchen and sitting area is very open but the star of the show is the back yard and patio.  What a treat!  I would definitely stay here again.",clean
"This is one of the most special places in the world.  The house is literally at the top of a mountain with epic canyon views and the Pacific Ocean.  Drive down to the bottom and you are in the heart of Malibu. Go down the other side and you are in Calabasas.  You'll want to explore all these part of LA, but the highlight is the house itself. It was owned by Van Morrison and the blue guest room was his recording studio.  <br/><br/>The back of the house has over 3000 square feet of living space including a stunning pool.  Every hour of the 24 hour day is magical in some way with the highlight being sunsets that will make you cry.  You'll get to know all aspect of mother nature.  There are hummingbirds, hawks, crows, bats, and countless other bird species.  <br/><br/>The highlight was the generosity of our host, Azmina. She brought us food,  connected us to babysitters, showed us the best things to do, eat and hike, she was amazing. Our children loved her and her dog, Ziggy.  They were always there to ensure we were having a wonderful vacation, while respecting our privacy.  We would recommend this place to anyone!",location
"This place is magical! Very good energy, I recommend getting enough food for the week and staying in. Will definitely be back.",location
"This place was phenomenal. Exactly as advertised. We spent 4 nights there and never even made it down the mountain to the beach. It was enjoyable enough to do some nearby hiking and just enjoy the experience of staying at the house - the deck, the pool, the views. And our host Azmina was equally great. Our group took a cross country flight and when we finally arrived at night, she had provided us with snacks, fruit and other food for breakfast the next morning. All around 5 star experience.",location
This house is a gem! The outdoor space alone is worth a visit. There are so many little nooks and crannies to discover outside- so many spots to sit and relax while enjoying the views. The house is so comfortable and fully stocked- we wanted for nothing during our visit! Azmina left us sweet treats to welcome us and made us feel right at home.  Canât wait to come back for another staycation.,location
"Azminaâs house is a true gem! The deck and outdoor spaces allow you to truly enjoy the beauty of the location. The house is stocked with everything youâll need - plenty of towels, toilet paper, paper towels, sheets, blankets - even a lot of treats, snacks and cooking essentials from Azmina! Everyone on site was responsive and helpful, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Thank you, Azmina and Marshall!",clean
"Azminaâs house is gorgeous. The view is so stunning in person, photos could never do it justice. The house is so comfortable and Azmina provides everything you may need. Sheâs a fantastic host who really went above and beyond to make sure my mom and I were comfortable during our stay. Highly recommend this place!!!",location
Azminaâs house was amazing and perfect for our party of 6. The views off the back deck were unbelievable. Azmina was extremely accommodating and provided us with helpful tips throughout our weekend. The house came stocked with many snacks and drinks too. Couldnât have asked for a better weekend.,location
"Beautiful place with plenty of room to lounge and rest. Azmina is a great host, super responsive, and went above and beyond to welcome my friends and I. The only downside is getting up and down the hill, but if you bring groceries or order in, you never have to leave. Perfect views from said hill :)",location
"We had a wonderful time at Saddle Peak.  We are regular airbnb travelers and this home is one of the best.   It is very comfortable, clean and very well maintained. There are plenty of outdoor spaces to watch the sunset or just sit back and relax.  The living room is great for family gatherings and the kitchen is very well stocked.   Azmina is an amazing host.  She goes out of her way to make you feel comfortable and welcomed.  She supplied snacks, fresh flowers and breakfast food for us when we arrived and made sure we had everything we needed.

"Azmina communicated very well, checked in every day, and even started us off with a bunch of snacks and groceries. It was very sweet. <br/><br/>It rained a bit, so we didnât get full use of the deck, but the time that we did was something special. The view is amazing.",location

Just wow. What an amazing place with so much history. The views are stunning. Just pure magic how the fog rolls in from the ocean below in the morning. The birds. The pool. Amazing. But the cherry on the cake was Azmina. She went above and beyond to make our stay so special.,location
What a fantastic week we have just spent in Azminas' home. The property was amazing with surroundings and decor that made you feel instantly at home with incredible views from the deck area of the valleys below and the sea beyond. It was a great base to explore LA but equally as good to spend a relaxing day lounging by the pool. Azmina as a host went above and beyond to make our holiday there a memorable one.,location

"Wow! Our stay was magnificent from check in to when we sadly had to leave. Having stayed at other Airbnb locations, Iâm positive Azmina is honestly the best host. You can tell that she loves providing the best experience possible. We were able to check out the L.A. scene and sights and then return to her relaxing retreat. Our only regret was that we didnât have more time.<br/>Iâm reluctant to rave too much and risk not being able to rebook in the future. We would go back in an instant!",location

When I come home from a very stressful day at work, dinner would always be ready and both Blondy and mommy would listen to my rants, just like how a mom and sister would. You will never find a home as good as this place in LA. Please do not hesitate to stay here. It is super close to UCLA and Westwood and in such a convenient location! The rooms are always nice and clean too! This location is more than just a house, itâs truly a place you can call Home.",clean
"If youâre a girl: Please note that the hosts prefer guys since girls are âtoo demanding and sensitiveâ, and  although the listing doesnât show any house rules, once you arrive theyâll hand you a list of them. Youâre barred from having any guests at any time (let alone them spending the night with you), eating in your room, drinking, doing laundry at any time other than 2x a week for a couple of hours each,etc. It felt like I was back at my parentâs house or a college dorm with even more supervision. Additionally, I had booked a room with queen sized bed, 5 months prior to my arrival, and it was only once I checked in that I was told Iâd be in a small room with a twin bed, next to the laundry and garage. The guest whose room I wouldâve stayed in, the room pictured in the listing when I booked it, decided to extend his stay so the hostess gave me a much smaller room with a smaller bed, with no advance notice. When I mentioned that I was disappointed with the room, particularly because I expected my boyfriend (of 4 years) to visit for a day or two at some point and a twin bed would be too small for the both of us, I was told that I shouldâve told them at the time of booking and if I had a problem with it, that I should move elsewhere because, in their words, âtheyâre not running a motel.â Although I got a refund of $300 for 2 months of parking, the monthly cost was still $2100 for a tiny, uncomfortable room. The girl staying in the room next to mine experienced  the same thing, where she also paid for a large room with a nice bed, and once she arrived, they slotted her in a much much smaller one and continued to pay the same amount regardless. Many people have had nice experiences there, but Iâd just suggest you be conscious of what the atmosphere is really like, since thereâs a lack of transparency in the listing.",location

The lavishly decorated house offers comfortable, spacious rooms with private bathrooms, a large chill-out area indoor and outside, a beautifully arranged garden with several bbq places, and a swimming pool. The chances are, you will meet like-minded people and cultivate meaningful friendships that will last for life. If you are a student, researcher, scholar, or scientist visiting UCLA, you will find this place a real treat as it is located less than a mile from campus (a 15-minute walk to north campus, to be precise). I had the most pleasant and rewarding experience staying at LaDoris' home.

"I had an absolutely great stay at Janet's Manhattan Beach home. The house was always clean and inviting, and everything that I needed was always available. Palm Avenue was a wonderful neighborhood that was only a 20 minute walk from Manhattan Beach Pier. Janet herself was a wonderful host. She was always very eager to tell me all the great things that were going on in Manhattan beach. She was consistently welcoming and made sure that I was comfortable. Overall I could not have asked for a better stay in Manhattan beach. I would definitely recommend Janet and her home. ",clean
"Janet made me feel at home from the second I arrived at LAX to the minute I left. Not only did she help clean my living space, but she helped make sure everything was in order for my arrival and departure. She even drove me to the airport for my trip home. Her dog and (one of) her cats are super-friendly and always greeted me at the door. The other cat tended to stay outside and not in the house. The neighborhood is very nice and quiet and is extremely close to the beach, but it is also close to main roads and the highway. Janet also provided me with many resources to find new things to do in LA and the Manhattan Beach area.",location
"Janet is an absolutely amazing person. The stay at her house was great! From a location perspective, there is no better place. Right next to LAX, extremely close to great restaurants and the best beach in LA. From a human perspective, Janet is a true gem. If I ever need a place to stay again, Janet's house will be the first place I look. Thank you so much!!!",location
"My stay with Janet in Manhattan Beach was for six months and I enjoyed every minute of it.  Janet is very gracious, kind, generous, and knowledgable.  She would leave me 'treats' e.g. homemade apple crisp along with a cheery note to start my day.  She lives in a very friendly neighborhood full of people out walking their dogs, children playing ball in the street, and even a lemonade stand. One of Janet's very kind neighbors helped me out when I locked my keys in my car. The location of her house is ideal for everything fun in Manhattan Beach.  The greenway aka chip path is a block and a half away which leads you to shopping/restaurants to the east and Manhattan Beach village and the pier as well as further destinations south.  There's also Sand Dune Park with its cardio-challenging staircases which is another fun way to get to the beach.  This place is awesome!",location

"I loved my stay at Craig's house. It's in a great spot high in the hills with views all the way to the ocean, but only five minutes away from Franklin Village shopping and restaurants. Lots of fun decor. I enjoyed the use of his pianos (two!) and other instruments, as well as his well-curated vinyl collection. Great deck for enjoying the view. Craig was easy to communicate with and a great host. Hope to return soon.",location

"I stayed for 10 weeks in Janet's house for my summer internship in El Segundo. Janet was extremely nice and accommodating and always made sure that I had everything that I needed. She would also sometimes leave baked treats for me in the mornings before work which was also very nice of her! She definitely made sure I was comfortable with my stay.<br/><br/>The place itself had its pros and cons. It has a great location near Manhattan Beach and all the shops. Everything was a short walk away which was super convenient. However, as one of the cons, I would recommend stayers to be very comfortable with pets. The house does have a relatively strong pet odor. Also, there are quite a few cobwebs and bugs around the place. In general, the house could use some more cleaning, but that was probably mostly because of the pets that live there. Overall, I'd be hesitant to stay there again if I came back to El Segundo.",location
"I spent nearly 3-months at Janet's place. Overall, this place has perfect location, and Janet is a very nice host.<br/><br/>* Location: manhattan beach is definitely a great neighborhood. It's very quiet, safe, and close to the beach, park, mall, restaurants. I really enjoyed jogging along the beach at night, riding my bike along the beach in the weekend, and attending the free public events in the ocean-view Manhattan Beach Library.  You can hardly find a location better than Manhattan Beach. <br/><br/>* The room/house itself: when you stay here, you have your own bedroom, private bathroom, and a study room, so 3 rooms in total! Janet is a very generous host, if you have bike or additional luggage, you can leave them in her garage. The house is spacious and decorated with some original arts. When holiday comes, the house will be decorated with all kinds of holiday-theme ornaments. The house itself is a bit old, so are the furnitures. Therefore guests should have a reasonable expectation before moving in. <br/>In addition, guests should be comfortable with pets. Janet has 3 pets, 2 cats and 1 dog. 1 of the cat Kitcat stays outdoor all the time, the other cat Gracy spend about half time outdoor and halftime indoor.  The dog Monty stays indoor most of the time.<br/><br/>* The host: There is no doubt that Janet is a very nice host, easy to communicate, and if you have any request, she will really try her best to make you feel comfortable. She always leave nice notes to me, and share her desserts with me.<br/><br/>* In summary, you can hardly find a location better than Manhattan Beach, I would recommend this place as long as you do not cook much and are comfortable with pets. Considering the housing price in this area, the rent you pay is no doubt a great deal.",location
"I was driving across the country to move to California and found Manhattan Beach only because Janet graciously offered to let me stay for a couple of months upon a very last-minute request and she had the best deal around! She met me the night Iarrived with a welcome sign on the door and often had tasty treats in the kitchen and thoughtful notes in the morning. I really enjoyed getting to know her during my stay and she was very helpful as I transitioned during my move. I loved being in Manhattan Beach so much that I found my own place in town. I really enjoyed my stay and had plenty of space. The office was an added bonus. Although I didn't have full use of the kitchen, it worked out fine and between using the microwave and eating out at many of the great restaurants.",host

Very respectful of your space and privacy within the house and she gives a heads up should she need to use the shared office. Janet herself is very kind and fun to talk to and her pets (Greasy and Monty) are very happy to see you any time you arrive back to the house!",host

The house was clean, and the beds were very comfy. There is a smart thermostat. The neighborhood was quiet and nice looking, I had no worries parking in the driveway in the night. Close to disneyland, which we visited that weekend, as well as the Aquarium of the pacific.",location

The house was just as described - really lovely, light and open - plenty of space of us all (family of 4). The outside area is great with awesome pool and fabulous sunsets. The house is positioned really well for all Eagle Rock has to offer - cool bars and restaurants and the very important Trader Joe's and Vons, both less than 5 mins away by car.<br/>We had a fabulous month at Glacier Drive and were very sorry to leave. Very fond memories and we hope to go back at some point. Thank you  both for letting us share your beautiful, creative home for our holiday.",location

The location is awesome, right on the beach and walkable to the restaurants and stores on Main Street as well as a short walk into Venice Beach. All in all it was beautiful. The apartment was clean and had a great view of the ocean. The building itself has a pool and gym. I would definitely stay here again.",location
"Sam was very flexible meeting our arrival time needs and responding to requests while we were there. The apartment has a great ocean view, easy access to the beach and is very convenient to Main Street restaurants and shops. We liked the building security and the dedicated parking is a real plus.<br/><br/>The kitchen was a little short of cooking utensils if you really want to cook; however, Sam was very receptive to our suggestions and I think it won't be an issue for future guests.",location
" Let me first say the place was spectacular! I would say just as pictured however the pictures do it no justice. Everything was clean, neat and Sam was very accommodating. There was plenty of towels and the regular amenities (such as shampoo and body wash)  you would find at high end resorts.  This was our first time staying with AirBNB and I say it will not be my last. ",clean
"Sam's place is everything he describes in the listing and more. The location is impossible to beat, the decor is modern, pristine and offers everything one would need during their stay. The balcony is large with breathtaking views of both the ocean and the beautiful city of L.A.  I will absolutely stay here again!  ",location

Definitely would recommend her place.",location
"Jackie communicated clearly and openly about the house rules and that the Airbnb was not intended for hosting or parties. The house was exactly what my quiet little group was looking for on our quiet little weekend. The Airbnb was clean, beautifully decorated, and well-stocked with everything we could need (e.g., household supplies like plastic utensils, plates, cups). The couches were comfy, beds and pillows were firm and great for back pain, and the linens were soft and clean. The house was in a great location and only a few minutes away from the beach and pier. Parking was easy. The house had a comfortable homey feel that made it nice to look forward to when we returned to the Airbnb every night. No complaints!",clean

"This is an older home having wood floors that creak a little when you walk  - but, cozy & comfy nonetheless! We spent quite a bit of time out on the back patio, which is really nice. Only had trouble with the wifi initially...but our friendly host, Jackie, was extremely responsive and helped us to get it going :)",clean
"Sam was very flexible with our check-in time and a great host. The Apartment was sensational, better than the photos, and we ended up extending our stay. Very modern, luxurious, clean, and right on the beach, within walking distance to anywhere in Santa Monica and 3rd Street Promenade.<br/><br/>We had a great time and next time I am in L.A. will most definitely re-book .",location
"This was my first Airbnb experience and Robert made it awesome. Not only was he patient and accommodating (even when our afternoon flight was delayed :P) but the place itself was absolutely beautiful. Nice, open, spacious. The apartment was extremely clean and nicely decorated. Robert met up with us, gave us all the keys and information we needed, and even offered to point us in the direction of cool places/restaurants... Don't even get me started on the views.. In one direction you have expansive views of the whole city, and in the other you can see the beach, Palm trees, and the ocean.. Amazing. My girlfriend and I would ABSOLUTELY book this place again! 2 min walk to the stores on Main Street, 45 second walk to have your toes in the sand. ",location
Nice house to stay for family vocation. I stayed there for two nights and really enjoyed.,location

Amazing views and lots of amenities. Craig was super easy to deal with. Everything A+,location
"The unit is exactly as pictured, and the view is gorgeous. The building is conveniently located between the ocean and cute little downtown area, about halfway between the main areas of Venice and Santa Monica, so extremely walkable which we definitely appreciated. The carpet was very clean and soft (take your shoes off, obviously), like carpet should be but rarely is. Plenty of clean dishes; kitchen was uncluttered but equipped with everything we could have needed. Lots of fluffy towels, an assortment of toiletries, and a very comfortable bed with plenty of pillows. Super easy free assigned parking under the building. The unit is impeccably maintained - I just wish we'd been able to stay longer!",clean
This was our first experience with Airbnb and it was very pleasant! Getting access to the place was very easy and the it was super clean/nice. No complaints! ,clean
"We had a wonderful stay at this fabulous ocean view resort like apartment. It is exactly as pictured/described and super clean. Robert is easy to communicate with, a very efficient host.

Brilliant location with fantastic views in the evening. This apartment is self-sufficient and we really liked the balcony accessible from bedroom and living room.,location
"Best Airbnb experience ever. We felt at home, great view, a lot of space. Just perfect!",location
The Apartment was right next to the beach and not to far from Santa Monica Pier. Sundy farmer market is just across the street. The Pool area is also great to relax and has a little restaurant. We enjoyed our stay!!!,location
Great place with the Best location ,location
"This home has 2 things going for it; a wonderful location and an attentive property manager. Other than that, the photos are deceptive and the house falls short of its ânewly remodeledâ tagline with too many areas that couldnât possibly be updated, i.e., kitchen floors,  kitchen cabinets, water pressure in the master bathroom. In addition, the family room furniture was so outdated & worn and it looked nothing like the photos. Truly, this was a big disappointment as our hopes of interacting as a family in a comfortable setting did not come to fruition. All in all, the price of the house was primarily for its location and size; all other listed amenities are a below expectation.  I think this house would be wonderful to stay in, but the owners need to put an investment into this property past just touching it up.  The furniture in family room is so low, I felt like I was sitting on the floor! ",clean
Good location 10 minutes walk to good restaurants <br/>Easy parking and checking in  very well managed,location
"Fantastic location in the heart of Beverly Hills.<br/>Walkable to many restaurants, shops and entertainment. The unit was extremely clean. Sam was very responsive to any questions. Would definitely recommend Sam as a host.",clean

Check in was prompt and simple, the whole house is equipped and has that 5* hotel cleanness feeling. THE view of a lifetime!!!

It was defiantly quite overwhelming at first . :D Defiantly will be back when I come to LA! <br/><br/>Do not miss this opportunity of staying here, u fully won't regret it .. ",location

It was everything as advertised. Great Location. Very close to Metro Station or bus stop. 15 minutes far from Hollywood. Brendan & Stina are very respectful and friendly.

Great host accommodated my in and out situation with close proximity to everything. Thank you guys,location
I arrived later in the evening but had no issues getting to the house. It's maybe a 5 to 7 minute walk to the nearest metro so it's super convenient. Stina and Brenden were great-they even invited me to a comedy club show that Friday. AND the grilled cheese was awesome. They both constantly made themselves available if I had any questions. From beginning to end I had an awesome time.,clean

Very nice quiet and clean place. There was ample street parking on the street. The hosts were very accommodating and welcoming.,clean
We stayed here for 3 nights. The location is excellent with bus stops/metro/whatever amenities you need nearby. Plus it's pretty near Hollywood blvd. Brendan and Stina were extremely hospitable. Our room was a little small but had a table and clothes rack which was great. We had a great time playing with their dog Belmont and 2 super adorable kittens which are unfortunately going away soon :(. ,location
"This was our first time with Airbnb, and it was really good. The room is exactly as the photos. Brendan and Stina was kind and helpful with everything we asked them about.

The beach house is amazing! The house is very clean and has everything you could want. The amenities are top class and the bed is soooooo comfy. It is actually difficult to leave the place during the day because it is so comfortable. The views from the roof are outstanding and it is a great spot to sunbathe.<br/><br/>As a big bonus - Lauren was fantastic. She was very friendly and nothing was too much effort. Lauren even dropped some home grown vegetables for me to cook with.<br/><br/>If I go back to L.A this is somewhere I MUST stay again.,clean
"My partner and I really enjoyed our time at the Modern Venice Beach House. Our host Lauren was lovely, the home was decorated beautifully, very clean and convenient to both the beach and downtown Venice Beach. We had a great weekend. ",clean
"Lauren is an incredible host with an amazing property, the house is stunning. For a place so close to the beach in Venice it's so peaceful and makes an ideal place to relax but you head off in to the Venice madness. The house is spectacular, a real treat and looks exactly how you would wish an LA designer house to look. The real difficulty is having the house, the sofas are so comfortable and the view astounding that you don't want to leave. The bed as mentioned before is sumptuous and one of the best sleep providers I've ever known. The kitchen has everything you could wish for and the roof terrace is the cherry on the cake. Lauren made us feel at home, she's smart, warm and knowledgable. I look forward to returning. Ps The photos do not do justice to how great this place looks, it's way better in real life.",location
"Highly recommended. This home is cool, comfortable and convenient. Overall, the experience was as advertised. Sandy Venice beach along with all of its amenities are within steps . The Roof top patio is great and a very enjoyable place to be. Good food and good shopping is also abundant within 5-10 minutes walk. Whole foods is about 15 minutes walk down local streets. Its a nice way to see the non tourist side of Venice. The house was also free of personal clutter from the owner which was very nice. We liked the area a lot, it's a very eclectic place. The host, Lauren, is kind and helpful with information. I appreciate the opportunity to enjoy the home and would absolutely consider another stay here during my next trip to Venice. ",location
"Lauren was great and the place was fantastic, she help us with all our needs.",clean
"Lauren is a wonderful host, and even made herself available during Thanksgiving to work out some issues that came up.  The house itself was good but not great, especially at this price point.  Some of the issues appear to have been temporary glitches during the time we were there (like the TV not working properly, the dishwasher leaking onto the floor, and the floors and other surfaces not being especially well cleaned), and others seem to be more permanent (like the AV cooling fan in the second bedroom that was running 24/7 and was too loud for my traveling companion, who ended up having to sleep on the couch).  Other folks seem to have had a wonderful time here, and we had a pretty dang nice time.  I'd just say don't assume the house has the things you might want (like salt and pepper, lights on the bedside tables, or much in the way of cooking utensils), and be prepared for a fairly spartan aesthetic.",clean
"Lauren was a great host. Very easy to work with. The house is new, clean and very comfortable. Great location in Venice!!  We would definitely stay again. Highly recommend. ",clean
"Lauren was an outstanding host. She was extremely responsive in lining up the rental, meeting us and getting us setup upon arrival, and giving us on point  recommendations throughout the week! And the property was everything it looks to be online--modern, well furnished and perfectly located between the beach and all there is to do on Abbot Kinney & Main St. This was a fabulous rental for our spring break trip to LA, and we couldn't recommend Lauren more highly.

"Quite a magical place to stay. Sitting on the balcony with the Hollywood sign on one side of you and a view across the ocean on the other side is wonderful.<br/><br/>The Hollywood Hills, despite being such an iconic place, feel secluded, quiet and safe. We had a encounter with a coyote and humming birds during our stay.<br/><br/>Craig was very easy to deal with and we had no issues during our stay at all.",location
I couldnât have booked a better location for my stay. I loved the entire vibe of this Home.  There were so many intricate details and decor that took me back to greater days in history. We couldnât help but to play the records of some of our greatest musicians while staying in. The sunset was spectacular all around. Iâd definitely stay here again. Craig was an amazing host and was very easy to contact. Thank you for all your help and hospitality. We loved your home and hope to share some of the spectacular shots we got during our stay. Thanks again.,location

"The place here is an oasis above LA. The most fantastic view from this very cosy and charming house. We loved to walk down to Hollywood Boulevard (just a little walk), to eat at two terrific thai restaurants quite close. And we enjoyed the grand piano.  A calm and quiet place, but you feel the vibe of LA beneath you. We loved everything about this stay.",location
"Craig was great to deal with and very accommodating.  His home is great with stunning views of Hollywood. <br/><br/>Great neighborhood, quite and like living in a country village, but with the convenience of only being a short drive from Hollywood and all the great things Los Angeles has to offer.",location
"Craig was friendly and quick to respond to messages. He was easy to communicate with and addressed both our needs which led to our successful gathering for our friends' birthday celebrations. His home was definitely a conversation starter during our gathering. His home also provided us a cozy stay, and the beds can either be quite soft or on the stiffer side. Beautiful view from the balcony and great night and day ambience! Thank you, Craig!",location
"This was my first airbnb stay and it's difficult to imagine how it could've been better. My parents came into town for a weekend and I wanted them to be close to my apartment, but I also wanted them to experience something beyond a hotel room (and there are many nice choices in the area).<br/><br/>Let me reiterate this: I live down the hill from this place; I could walk there. But I willingly and eagerly gave up sleeping in my own bed to go stay with my parents in this house -- that's the best way I can describe how good it is. The photos are accurate but they can't really touch the actual view, which is brilliant no matter what time of day -- waking up to it is amazing, the sunsets are amazing, and nighttime is amazing with all the other houses in the valley lit up. (I'm used to seeing the Hollywood sign, but my parents told me that was also amazing.) Equally nice to drink a cup of coffee or a glass of wine on the deck. Also the house itself has a very warm, welcoming feel; it's not the kind of sterile art gallery or spa-type houses you see a lot of around here. And the hills are quiet. The only warning I'd offer is regarding the drive up to the house: Expect very narrow roads and blind corners as you wind your way up the hill -- just have a smallish car and go slow.<br/><br/>And Craig is a pleasure to deal with. Communication was quick, friendly and completely stress-free -- even after I spilled a whole bottle of vinegar on the kitchen floor (sorry again).<br/><br/>All in all, a really memorable experience and my parents absolutely loved it. <br/><br/>Thanks Craig!",location
Craig's place was awesome and was exactly how it looked on line.. Unbelievable view and peaceful and certainly gives you a feel of what it would be like to live in the Hollywood Hills,location
"Big thumbs up! This house was perfect! We stayed in LA for one night and saw a concert at the Hollywood bowl!

Thank you!!",location
"My family loved their stay at this condo! It is very close to LAX, which is what we wanted. The kitchen is spacious and just as pictured. We spent a lot of time cooking and hanging out at the kitchen/living room area, which has a great view of the surrounding area. <br/><br/>One thing we were surprised about was the number of stairs in the unit. There are 2 flights of stairs - one flight from the garage level (which has one bedroom) to the 2nd level (which has 3 bedrooms and 2 full bathrooms) and another flight from the 2nd level to the 3rd level (which has the living room, kitchen, and half bath). We didn't mind the stairs at all, but felt it was worth mentioning in case other visitors travel with elderly folks who can't go up stairs easily. <br/><br/>Due to the proximity to the airport, we did hear planes fly by late into the night and early morning. It wasn't too bothersome to us since we wanted to be close to the airport. <br/><br/>It was a short drive to the beach and our host left some beach chairs, beach towels, and boogie boards for our use, which was very sweet. Overall a great stay!",location

"Brendan and Stina were perfect hosts and I am definitely staying with them when I get back to Los Angeles. The room was clean and tidy and looked exactly as the photos. They were very flexible with the times and even let me leave my bags in the apartment until I left later as I had a late night flight. The neighbourhood was very active and had all the facilities at walking distance. Public transport was a 4 minute walk - very convenient. I did not get to spend much time with the hosts, but they were always kind and willing to help. Thanks Brendan, Stina, Angela and Belmont :)",clean
Didn't meet them but the house was neat and clean and it was well managed. Was suspicious about the neighborhood though. Rest was good for a quick one night stay.,clean
"This place is just two blocks away from buses and the metro, so it was a great location for getting around the city without a car. The room was clean and as described in the listing. If you're going in the summer, be prepared for no air conditioning. There was a small fan in the room, which helped some. I only briefly met Brendan and Stina in person, but they seemed really friendly. Also, they were very communicative through messaging. The bathroom was somewhat dirty. Overall, this was a good experience. ",clean
"Brendan and Stina are excellent hosts.  They try, and succeed, at making one feel very much at home.  It was a hot night and Stina hooked me up with an extra fan.  They told me to help myself to food, so I had a nice breakfast of oatmeal, banana and a little peanut butter.  They were flexible with checkin and checkout.  Thanks.  ",host
Brendan and Stina were amazing hosts! I didn't see much of them because they were out of town but they were very nice and welcoming!! The room is perfect for a person (Or Two) traveling and it is SUPER EASY to get to and from with the public transit. A Great experience and I recommend them!!,location
Brendan and Stina are very welcoming host... though we only met them briefly during our 2 nights stay... the place is quite homey and close to metro,location
"Absolutely great! Super super nice people, very friendly. Showed and explained a map and bus schedule in surrounding area, and was very helpful. ",clean
"I met Angela, Brendan and Stina. They are all friendly. The location is near the metro of Vermont / Santa Monica Station, just walk through 5-10 minutes and the room was clean. If I will visit Los Angeles in the future, I think it will be my first option to live.",clean
" Hosts: friendly & knowledgeable of the area & how to most easily get to where. They are very ""our home is your home"". I felt more like a cousin in town than a stranger. Brendan made us pork chops Saturday morning & Stina made some BOMB cupcakes. Great folks.<br/> Room: Comfy bed. Perfect size for me. Small fan if you like breezes. Shelves shown are book-filled & on top EVERYTHING you might want to know about LA & getting around it. There's even a ""Not For Tourists"" book with more in depth local info! Full kitchen access. Nice bathroom/shower.<br/> 'Hood: SUPER convenient location near Metro Red line & several buses. No more or less sketchy than anywhere else in Hollywood. Polite neighbors & I felt safe at all times as I walked around at night to 7-11, RiteAid or El Gran Burrito (on Santa Monica. Highly recommended!). Lots of small bakeries & other eateries as well as some corporate stuff within a short walk. ",location
"Quintessential  Hollywood Hills house.  Great view, including the iconic Hollywood sign.<br/>Perfect house.  Must book. Thanks Craig!!",location
Brendan and Stina were great hosts that made me feel really welcome. The bed was comfy and the atmosphere at West Hollywood was great. They had a good selection of maps and knowlage of the area and the place is a 2 min walk from the metro station. Great first AirBnB experience.,location
"This place was perfect, the bedroom was clean and the perfect size, very cosy, atmosphere-wise. The kitchen and bathroom are nice and gives you a sense that you're living with a real family, it has lots of character. In terms of the neighbourhood, a little bit dirty but most of central LA is like that. The apartment is right near a subway station, plus many bus routes. It's hard to find an area you're not connected to by public transit in some way. I was here for a whole month and I couldn't have asked for better hosts than Stina and Brendan. They were very welcoming, and made sure everything was perfect. They even invited me to a few events with them and their friends, which I appreciated because I was a solo traveller and sometimes it got a little lonely.  Their little dog, Belmont, is also very sweet. If you want a place that is clean with a great atmosphere, wonderful location for getting around, lovely hosts who care about their guests, at amazing cheap prices, this place is for you!!!!",clean
"Brendan & Stina are so nice, they invited me to join their thanksgiving party. I had really great time.",host
"Brendan and Stina were great hosts. The room is exactly as in the description and the situation is wonderful (you can even go walking to Hollywood attractions<br/><br/>Stina helped me a lot in my trip to/from the airport, fact that I consider really really important.",clean
"Lovely people, great location, the room is exactly as described.  ",clean
"This was such a lovely place to stay and Brendan & Stina were all too welcoming. They offered as much support in getting out to do your own thing as they did when I would hang around the apartment for a day. Notes around the house helped me know what to expect and where things were. And they had so much stuff to offer that I felt overpacked for sure. Plenty of great food in the neighborhood, a shopping strip and transit within walking distance. And of course, the board game collection was epic!",location
"We are so grateful to Stina and Brendan's prompt reply, this allowed us to plan our trip to LA better. When we arrived, they welcomed us, along with Belmont (Stina's and Brendan's cute puppy!) and made us feel at home.  The room was better than described, it was neat and tidy and there were plenty of books to read and extra blankets! Stina and Brendan are super open and accessible to their kitchen. They allowed us to put our food in their fridge and were welcomed to help ourselves to anything in their fridge. <br/><br/>The apartment is located in an accessible area making it easy to travel to K-Town, the Observatory, Santa Monica, Venice & Downtown within 30 mins (in a car, and not considering traffic!) But true to their word, Stina and Brendan both were very knowledgeable on getting around LA without a vehicle. <br/><br/>We really appreciate their kindness and accessibility into their home. We lacked nothing, everything we needed, they had. It was a nice haven from the busy place that was LA! ",clean
"Great location, very convenient. Our room was clean cute.  Would definitely do it again. Brendan and Stina was friendly and helpful.",clean
"Man, the view on this place was incredible. The peaceful surroundings (we saw 3 deer one morning) the proximity to the good bits of LA, and the musical theme throughout made this my favourite stateside trip so far.<br/>Breakfast on the terrace, making cocktails at the bar, and having Craig's vinyl to entertain ourselves on a quiet evening was great. Not to mention the grand piano and musical theme throughout the house. Didn't turn the TV on once.<br/><br/>Craig was responsive and helpful throughout.<br/>Would come back!<br/><br/>For balance, the gym (not pictured) are a few sets of dumbells on the grass outside. Enough if you know a free weights routine - but not for cardio. But then, you have the hills!",location
"Place as described, with an eclectic decoration, cosy and great views. Check in was super easy and Craig was responsive at all times. Thanks,<br/>Guillermo ",location
Craig is great . The place is perfect . View is incredible .,location

I had a great time starting with Brendan and Stina. They were very welcoming and friendly and answered all my questions. They also respected my privacy and it was greatly appreciated. I also met Stina's amazing mom. I appreciate everything they did for me and my first stay in LA and definitely helped make it a great experience,clean
"The place is well communicated, near a metro station, and there are so many restaurants around. Brendan and Stina are nice hosts, I discussed my stay in Hollywood with them and they helped me to figure out what to do and gave me some really useful information. Only that it was bit noisy at night, I kept hearing the sound of TV, otherwise it would be all good. Still recommend :)",location
"This place is amazing. Clean, comfortable, bright, open, airy and easy. Waking up everyday to a panoramic view of the entire city of Los Angeles directly next to your bed never gets old. It was close to everything in MDR, Venice and Santa Monica. I was able to walk to a few of the restaurants down the street. I worked in Culver City during my stay and it was a breeze getting to and from work everyday. Never any traffic on 90. The community is very nice, well-kept and the host, Liberty is an absolute GEM! She went above and beyond to make my stay perfect. The Ritz-Carlton is literally a stone's throw from her balcony, but I'm sure I had a better stay than any of their guests. Kudos! ",location
"I had the most wonderful time . Liberty a apartment is so homey , comfortable and bright. Just the place I was looking for . Liberty herself was so helpful and so reachable if I needed anything . Wonderful experience . Thanks liberty :)",location
"Liberty was a real gem, as was her apartment! I really loved the spectacular view, the wonderful balcony and her little touches like leaving me candies and colognes were unexpected and super thoughtful. You can tell she really cares about her guests. I stayed here for a month and loved every second. Thanks Liberty!",location
"Liberty's place is comfortable, clean, and most importantly it has amazing view! My father from Japan stayed there and he said the place was better than any other hotels in the area. Liberty has been very helpful and accessible from the beginning of the booking till the end of the stay. I strongly recommend this place anyone! Thank you Liberty! :)",location
"Liberty's apartment is just as amazing as the pictures make it look. After a long day at work, it was perfect to come home to an apartment that is well maintained, cozy, and comfortable. You'll wake up every morning to a remarkable panoramic sunrise view of Los Angeles. During the day, the apartment is light and airy. The terrace provided a lovely spot for morning tea and evening wine. The complex felt safe and secure. The beach, restaurants, and grocery store are all within walking distance. <br/>Liberty was awesome. She was an amazing host and always available if we had a question. We had one minor problem with a drain and she had it fixed within hours. The basket of treats we were greeted with was also a nice touch. In short, 10 out of 10 - would stay again!",location
Amazing stay. Craig is a top notch provider. I would definitely recommend this house to anyone trying to stay in the hills and experience a great view.,location
Craigâs house is amazing. The views are spectacular and itâs a real treat for music lovers. Itâs beautifully decorated with all sorts of trinkets and the space is very clean. Would highly recommend staying here!,location
Such an amazing experience! Craig did everything to satisfy my stay. We had such a good time staying at Craigâs house! Awesome and unique view! Awesome records available and the grand piano was just amazing!,location
"Liberty went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable.  Truly shows that she cares about her clients and takes pride in her beautiful home.  Breathtaking view and so close to everything.  Also very clean, which I've come to find important in some of these rentals.  Highly recommended experience!  ",location
"We had an absolutely wonderful stay at Liberty's condo. Liberty was welcoming and attentive to all our needs. The Condo itself is bright and open. The view from the patio is breathtaking, you can take all of Los Angeles in. The complex amenities was probably the best feature. We were able to go to the gym and play tennis. We will definitely be back! ",location
"Liberty is a fantastic host and her place is absolutely gorgeous! Liberty goes out of her way to make your stay comfortable and feel like home. Everything was incredibly clean when I arrived and Liberty urged me to make myself feel at home. I spent three months at the apartment and it truly did feel like home! It's close to Venice and only a ten minute walk to the beach. Even better, it's only a two minute walk to the marina! A new park has just been built across from the apartment, which is great for walking and running (and biking). Coffee shops, a juice shop, and grocery stores are all within walking distance! Loves this stay!!!",clean
"For my second stay with Liberty, she was extremely accommodating in letting me book last minute for another month! (I loved the apartment that much.) I truly enjoyed renting from Liberty, she was so welcoming and helpful and truly a fantastic host. (Very responsive too!)  I spent days at her place running around the marina, working in the beautiful apartment with breezes and a view, and walking to Venice for dinners. Love Liberty and her apartment- highly recommend!!! ",location
"Liberty's place is amazing, very clean and with a very nice furniture, just like we can see on her photos. It have an amazing view to the Marina and the city of Los Angeles. The kitchen is very useful and complete. Perfect spot in Los Angeles, near the beach and with everything close, like supermarkets and pharmacies. Liberty is a great host and a great person, helped me every time I asked her. ",location
"We come to LA every fall for work and have stayed in various places. We found Liberty last year and we've never been happier. Last year we stayed at Liberty's place for 4 months and when Liberty messaged us to let us know that she would love to have us back this year we jumped at the opportunity. It was so sweet of her to reach out to us to let us know the place would be available for the 4 months we are there. There wasn't even a discussion, we just said ""of course"" and booked that same day.<br/>The area is quiet and there is a real sense of community. You can tell the people who live in the other condos really enjoy living there. Beyond all the amenities on the property, you are a short walk to the beach and places to rent bikes. Liberty let us use her bike for the stay and it was a great alternative to get to work on some days. Other days we just walked to work or took a very short Uber. We've even stopped renting cars when we come to town since we are so close to everything we need.<br/>Liberty had a great welcome kit ready for us, she remembered everything we had mentioned liking last year and there it was waiting for us! She also left sweet holiday presents for us, which was a real treat.<br/>Liberty checked in about once a month and it was nice to be able to ask questions or to share experiences but she was ALWAYS available via text for us with a very quick response. <br/>Its a great place to come home to after work with the view of the city and lights and a great place to wake up, seeing the sun rise and the city. <br/>My favorite thing to do when I woke up pre-sunrise was to take some coffee on the terrace and watch the sailboats and kayaks leaving the marina to get an early start on their day of fun.<br/>I would absolutely stay with Liberty for the 4 months again next year.",location
"Wow! This place is beautiful! So clean, yet comfortable with the most wonderful view! Liberty is the sweetest and was there whenever we had a question, immediately. We loved being here and would totally stay here again! ",location
"This is a fantastic apartment for a short or long term stay.  Beautiful views from an airy balcony, floor to ceiling windows and a central location for the West Side.  Liberty was a great host.",location
"This is the THIRD (yes, third) year we have stayed at Liberty's apartment for September - December. For reference that means we have stayed at Liberty's all together, over all our trips, over a calendar year total! That speaks volumes of how we feel about Liberty and her apartment. The area is perfect and convenient to everything. Sunsets and Sailboats are the only two loves of my life and here I get them daily. Her place is quiet and well kept, a great serene vibe. She also had my favorite snacks there for me when I arrived which was exactly what I needed after my long trips across country. Liberty is attentive and quick to respond to questions or for advice. When we come to the Marina its for work and her place is exactly what I need when I get home. An oasis in Los Angeles. At this point we consider it a home away from home and would absolutely stay there again.",location
"I just finished spending another amazing fall at Libertyâs place in Marina Del Rey. It is the perfect combination of vacation and home. I have been staying there in the fall for the past several years while Iâm in LA for work. Even after the longest days, relaxation washes over me the moment I walk  through the front door. The condo is bright, clean and filled with artwork and plants. I donât think I could ever get tired of sitting out on the balcony taking in the views of the ocean and the marina (or the night cityscape).  The apartment has the tools to prepare whatever food I need, from making a full dinner from scratch to blending a healthy smoothie. In addition to being an awesome host, Liberty is the best person around. She is a complete sweetheart and she always is on the lookout to make my perfect stay even better. This year when I arrived she even had a box of my favorite Lemon Zinger tea waiting in the cupboard to go along with a huge tray of snacks. I donât know why I ever leave!",location

"Brendan and Stina were very welcoming! The room was clean and matched the posted photos.<br/>The common area is very small and is usually crowded. There are a lot of people living in these apartment (~5), which has only one bathroom - may be an issue if you don't have time to wait in the mornings/evenings. Also, the neighbors are VERY loud, sit right under Brendan and Stina's apt window and yell and talk and play loud music until around 10pm. Wish I knew about this beforehand. (Although I need to mention again that Brendan and Stina are very welcoming and helpful.)",clean
"We felt welcome and being looked after. The accommodation is very close to the metro red Line. Just get out of the station using the Vermount Street exit, walk to your left, walk pass the LA city college sign, enter the side street to your left. The second corner block is the place.<br/>",location

"We really enjoyed our stay  in East Hollywood. Brendan and Stina were great. They were friendly, hospitable and even encouraged guests to eat food from their kitchen. Staying in their room felt like staying at an old friends house instead of a strangers. The apartment is very close to the metro which was convenient. The only downside is that we did not feel very safe walking in the area alone at night. Overall though it was a very positive experience and we highly recommend Brendan and Stina to future air-bnb'ers. ",location

Brendan and Stina are undoubtedly some of the nicest people on the face of the earth. They made us feel so welcome and accommodated above and beyond the average host's call of duty. My only regret is that we didn't get to spend more time with them! ,host

"Staying with Brendan & Stina was just perfect. The location was great, we wanted somewhere close to the Hollywood Forever Cinema, it took about 30 minutes to walk there. There was lots of food, coffee icecream within a walking distance as well. Finding parking was easy right near the apartment. I will also verify that they do like board games and have an excellent collection. We played two rounds of Carcasonne with Brendan before going to bed. The room was as described and comfy. I will look them up next time I am staying in LA.",location

"The hosts for this room were great, really friendly and welcoming, and the room is exactly as pictured: simple but extremely clean. Unfortunately, I can't be as complimentary about the neighborhood. The bedroom windows are about 6 feet from the next door neighbors and they were very loud, first with kids until about 10 pm, then with arguing and partying much of the rest of the night. The hosts listed that they owned a dog (cute one, too), but they hadn't mentioned that between the time I booked the room and my arrival they adopted a cat. I'm like call-911 allergic to cats, so I was forced to stay inside the room with the door closed whenever I was there. But the rest of the apartment wasn't a very comfortable place anyway...super cluttered, and as for the bathroom, I couldn't tell if the dark patches in the tub were from rubbed off porcelain or uncleanliness (and there was 1 bathroom for 5 inhabitants). I hate to complain too much because it was dirt cheap and they were such nice people, (in fact, that made this very hard to write).",clean
"The couples are very nice.<br/>His house is very near the metro, walking distance. It's very convenient to go everywhere to LA.<br/>Though there are other visitors living in his house,  I don't worry to use the bathroom.<br/>The pets are friendly, especially the cat. <br/>As for the food, there are Mexican and Chinese restaraunt nearby.<br/>Good and convenient place to stay.",location

"We stayed with our family of 5 and can fully recommend. We particularly liked the atmosphere the style of the timeless house and interior gave. It is quiet and views are great. The only misunderstanding from our side was that we assumed to arrive and find beds or sofa bed for 6 installed, but as correctly stated there are 2 bedrooms and each has a double bed. There is a big self inflatable queen bed available (which we didnât use). The sofa is not a sofa bed and while a kid can sleep on it we find it not sufficient for adults. Craig was very helpful and quick in responding.",location
An awesome experience!,clean
I've officially found the place I will always stay while in Los Angeles. Check in and the stay was super easy. Easy to get around from the house. And hosts are so nice and helpful!,location
"This is probably my most interesting Airbnb stay to date. The price is great for LA, and the place is pretty accessible. We slept fine, but we never felt very comfortable because the room was very small and cramped with two beds and a bag. Perhaps it's best to only stay here if there is one traveler? The bathroom and neighborhood were also a little sketchy, although the hosts were super nice and hospitable. There were cute little knick-knacks around the house which I loved as well. IN CONCLUSION: I'd recommend staying here if you are price sensitive and not too squeamish.",clean
"This place is fantastic and I cannot say enough good things about the manager, Mark! He is professional, kind and considerate of all of his guests. The apartment is cozy, but very clean and comfortable. Plenty of towels, dishes andother appliances, including the best little toaster oven. It is updated and nicely decorated and is also pretty quiet considering you're in the heart of Hollywood. While the building is an older building, Mark does a fantastic job of making sure it is clean, well maintained and safe, even offering towel service in the middle of our stay. Also, the parking can't be beat! Loved it so much I booked it twice.",clean

"Mark was very attentive to all my questions and concerns. I was very happy this studio apt had great sunlight. Also very happy to learn there is no smoking In the building, I donât think the post says that, but it was a happy surprise.

It's a simple, small, clean and convenient studio apartment in a great location - all a basic AirBnB at a competitive price in a high demand city needs.<br/>It is in walking distance of Hollywood walk of fame and the TCL Chinese Theater, as well as a central location with short driving distance to some of the major areas and attractions we wanted to visit  (Griffith Observatory, Hollywood Sign, Universal, Art District, Rodeo Drive - all within 25 min drive).<br/>Communication with the property manager, Mark, was easy and quick over text - he even went out of his way to get us a replacement iron super early in the morning (after we discovered that the iron was missing from the room).<br/>The check-in, parking spot, security and overall experience were fantastic.",clean
Nice location in the heart of Hollywood. Walking distance to anywhere. A little loud at night but it is Hollywood. <br/>Bed was a little uncomfortable and pillows sucked but for the price you pay it was worth it.,location

Great clean space. We loved it. Close to everything,location
"A very nice and clean compact apartment. Communication was great, I was met in person by the manager. It is only 5 minutes walk to the Hollywood strip, attractions and Metro stations.  Can strongly recommend.",clean
"We loved the location, right on Sunset Blvd, you can be at Hall if Fame in 5 minutes walking, there were a lot of restaurant and things to do without having to drive. But the place needs  a bit of TLC, itâs an old building so it had that old smell not just the building but the room also. My husband and me were staying for 3 nights and they only provided us with two bath towels, no hand towels or washcloth. The bathroom door didnât have a door knob. There was only 3 pouches of coffee which it wasnât enough for the two of us.  Those might seem as small details but for almost $400 hundred dollars that we paid for three nights I think the owner should pay more attention to those things to accommodate his guests.",clean
"The place was exactly as described. Near to everything, easy to walk and all the basic amenities. Extra points for the AC, toiletries (shampoo & body wash and even disposable toothbrush & toothpaste), the kitchen with all the appliances we needed plus instant coffee, sugar and salt. <br/>The manager introducing himself in person made as us few more comfortable.<br/><br/>Overall, the stay was really pleasant and seamless. Easy check in and check out. We would definitely book it again.<br/><br/>The only downside is that we found the building a little bit rundown, maybe it can be personal taste.",clean
Great location and nice little space.  Definitely would stay again.,location
Great location with parking. Prompt response when we requested extra blankets since it was pretty cold weather out. Iâd stay here again.,clean

It was such a lovely stay! My boyfriend and I stayed here for a month and we enjoyed every bit of it. The bed was comfy and we had such an enjoyable time here. Everyone in the building was very friendly and could not have had a better stay!,location
"I've been having a great experience at Roseman's place. In fact, I extended my stay twice. The location can't be beat, right around the corner from all the sights of Hollywood Boulevard, and all the restaurants, bars and coffee shops you could possibly want. It's also close to the freeway if you need to get to other parts of LA. The only real inconvenience is the lack of a stove, but the place is comfortable and has everything else you need.

"I stayed in this room for a long weekend after being in LA for a couple weeks on a work trip. I picked it because it was central to everything and a decent price. The room was no frills, but it was clean, conveniently located and had parking in the back, which was a HUGE plus. It's location is probably it's biggest selling point. It was right in Hollywood (a few blocks from the touristy strip), a short drive away from West Hollywood, Silver Lake, etc. and not too far from some really great hiking spots. I would recommend this room to anyone staying in he LA area who needs a place to crash.",clean
"The flat was great and cool, the location is just between the hollywood  and sunset boulevard, so not far and still much calmer than the boulevards themselves. The host was available by mail and very cool as we stayed till 6pm the last day before check out...<br/>Very nice stay overall...<br/>Thank you...",location

Brendan and stina were Very helpful hosts with tips for a first visit to la and answering any questions we had! The flat is Well located and easy to get around the city ,location
My second time staying with them. Another pleasant experience!,location
"The apartment was in a very convenient location and great infrastructure between downtown LA and Hollywood. The room was comfortable, lily (the temporary host) was very helpful and accommodating as was stina and brendon via the phone as they were out of town. The apartment was nice, but pretty dirty in the kitchen and bathroom, and parking was a real difficult situation. Overall I would recommend this place, and I would go back!! Thanks for the stay",clean
Hosts were really nice. Directions were very clear and they were pretty lenient about letting us stay in the space when my flight left late that night. Good times.,space
"Our stay at Brendan and Stina's was very enjoyable. We had some trouble getting our key in the beginning, but the hosts were very helpful and it worked out eventually. The bedroom and the bathroom were reasonably clean. <br/><br/>Perhaps it should be noted that the second bed in the ""East Hollywood""-room is simply a mattress. The other bed was very comfortable (or so I've been told), however. <br/><br/>Finally, the apartment is incredibly well located and very affordable. It's a three-minute walk to the next metro station, and from there you can easily go to Hollywood, Downtown Los Angeles, Santa Monica and Long Beach (also the last two may take a while, LA is huge!).",location
War alles okay (Everything was okay),clean
Very friendly and nice:) ,clean
Our stay was completly alright. Brendan was a perfectly nice host. Thanks to his kind invitation we had the chance to experience a great show of comedysports. Dont miss that if you get the chance. His cute dog has got new friends in us. All in all He made us feel very welcome. I would definitely visit him again. Hopefully I will have time to take advantage of his well sorted board game selection.,host

Brendan and Stina's place was great for my short stay in LA. Check-in was simple and the room/accommodations were as advertised. They were great hosts and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again or recommend it to anyone looking for a place in LA.   ,host

"Brendan and Stina were great hosts. Room and toilets were clean and tidy and the kitchen was well equipped. Location was great as it was close to the subway and public transport. The neighborhood is quite diverse but by no means unsafe, and there are plenty of shops and restaurants nearby. Their dog is friendly although quite timid.",clean
"Really well located place and Stina/Brendan are really amazing and nice people.  They allowed us to leave our bags early so that we can freely explore the city before check-in.  The place is clean and you've got free access to the food in the kitchen, which is a nice touch.  They also had a great array of boardgames but didn't get to try it out this time.  It was also a nice touch for them to leave the staircase lightshow on until we arrived during a latet night out.  Just the little touches that make you feel a little more at home.  Would love to stay here again next time we are in town!",clean
This house is close to Hollywood.,location
"I have stayed with Brendan & Stina multiple times, and they were wonderful as usual!

"Nice owners, great location..but too noisy either from inside of the house and from neigbours",location
"Great airbnb. Brendan and Stina are really nice, and so is Belmont. We checked in late and they explained everything to us so we could arrive whenever we wanted. They also let us leave our suitcases in the kitchen after we had checked out. <br/>The room is simple and small but clean and comfortable. Even the mattresses on the floor were comfy. You will have a desk to store some things and a clothing rack for your clothes. The bathroom was clean too. The kitchen was a bit messy but that's what makes it look like a home and not a hotel. Brendan and Stina also let you eat their food :) <br/>As mentionned in the comments and description the neighbours are really noisy. However, after a long day exploring L.A you'll be so tired the noise won't even be a problem and you'll sleep well.<br/>The location is really good too but make sure to download a map of the metro/buses in case the red line isn't functionning and you don't feel like walking too much. <br/>I totally recommand this airbnb, you won't find a better place for this price!",clean
Very friendly and accomadating. Close to tourist attractions and public transportation. Great for the price,location
"Stina and Brendan's place is in a good location, Belmont(the dog) is also very sweet!",location
This place was amazing. 2 minute walk from a metro station which takes less than 10 minutes to Hollywood. I walked at 10pm by myself and never felt unsafe. Loads of food and things nearby. <br/>The house is a home. It's like staying with a friend rather than in a hotel. <br/>Any request I had they helped.<br/>Would definitely stay here again,location
Everything was great! Clean room and bathroom. The location was good. It's close to bus stop and metro station and the best thing is the host. They allowed me to leave my stuff in the house and take a shower before leaving at the night.,clean

Everything went so smoothly! Appreciate meeting Stina too - sad I wasn't able to stay longer to get to know you guys better :) Hope there'd be another chance!,clean
"The place is pretty much as advertised. There definitely was a musty unclean smell to the apartment as well as some ants in the kitchen area due to an open box of sugar in the cabinet. The location is pretty great however and everyone in the building was pretty nice and friendly. It was a little loud at night, but that's hollywood for you. Lots of food options and places to go within walking distance. The building manager was prompt and polite. We had no issues checking in or out. Make sure to bring your own towels pillows and toiletries as they were very limited. Also the shower didn't have hot water. Luke warm at best. Basically you get what you pay for with this place. If you're on a budget then this would work for you. ",clean
Great Location!!!,location
"Amazing location.  Right in the heart of Hollywood.  Room was very clean, had everything we needed.  Very nice building. Only downside is parking can be a nuisance, even with a spot reserved.  But thatâs Hollywood. I recommend this place.",clean
Great place with great host. Amazing view. Would 10/10 reccomend Craig and his Home,location
"Craig is a fantastic host, who is extremely quick to reply to any questions. My inlaws stayed at Craig's for 3 months and were sd to leave  - it's a wonderful house with incredible views.",location
"Everything was beautiful and spotlessly clean. There were luxury amenities, gorgeous plants, two pianos, an incredible view every which way you looked. Plus driving uphill through the maze of streets made me a better driver, as well as giving us a breathtaking view. It was warm, and cozy, and my family and I loved staying there and were sad to leave.",clean
"This house is great - casual and elegant with stunning views.  Everything went smooth as silk.  And itâs a long story, but Craig went above and beyond when I forgot my bag at the house on my way to the airport.  We made the flight!",location
"Craig's place is a beautiful, airy space nestled in the Hollywood hills with incredible views. Having our morning coffee on the terrace enjoying the sprawling views over the city towards the ocean was a daily treat. It's a little walk down the hill to Gelson's supermarket and a short walk over to Griffith park. Hollywood, Silverlake and Studio City are all in close proximity. Craig is a lovely guy and he made us feel very at home. The beds are comfortable, there are plants, a perfectly tuned piano and curious little object here and there making this place very special indeed. We hope to return soon for more sunsets and inspiring chats with our gracious host.",location
Words can not explain Craig's place.  The view itself is super amazing.  We actually got the chance to meet Craig and he was a very cool and laid back person.  Definitely will be back soon :),location
"Our family had an amazing time at Tuxedo Terrace. Perfectly positioned, with views of the Hollywood sign and even as far as the ocean, we loved feeling far away from the noise and stress of the city, though we were only a few minutes away by car from Sunset and Hollywood Boulevards. Our kids thoroughly enjoyed spying all the cool decor touches, and the grand piano was a real treat. The winding roads up to the house are a joy to wander, as are the Griffith Park trails, which are only about a 15 minute walk from the front door. We would stay again in a heartbeat, highly recommend Craig's fabulous vintage-styled home, and had a fantastic week.",location
Lots of little nicknacks great view small driveway space but itâs Hollywood I guess they are all like that. Beautiful place,location

Great house with beautiful view and very responsive.,location
"Absolutely awesome! This house is just very very cool!  I really canât think of a better word to describe it. Youâll want to put on a record, pour some wine, relax and reminisce ( depending on your age) of the good old days while sitting on the deck admiring the spectacular view. Craig is an unbelievable host..such a nice guy, happily went out of his way for us.  What a great stay",location
"Craig is a great host and was able to work with our late arrival schedule. He leaves every possible direction there could be to all of his appliances, which is awesome. VERY clean place and extra touches and decor was on point. We felt very at home there. The inside is stunning but nothing beats that view. The view is nothing short of magnificent and he has awesome outdoor and indoor furniture to enjoy it on. Donât miss the chance to stay at the top of Tuxedo Terrace, you wonât regret it!!",location
"If you're looking for (1) a truly stunning view from the Hollywood Hills, (2) a unique and interesting space with tons of character and charm and history, (3) perfect, comfortable beds surrounded by a magical vibe and musical atmosphere, and (4) a truly awesome host that makes you feel like the place is yours, then look no further. Craig's place is all of these things are more. I was lucky enough to run into Craig while checking in, and I felt like I had known him for years. A truly special and gifted person, I'm grateful that he's decided to share his home with the AirBnB community. Highly recommended; would definitely stay again!",location
Craigâs house is incredibly beautiful. The pics donât do it justice. It exceeded my expectations.,location
"This is a great little studio at a great price! <br/><br/>The hosts were great and communication was awesome and thorough. <br/><br/>The space was super clean and felt fresh. It looks like a recent remodel with new floors, kitchen and bathroom all redone with quality materials. The bedding/linens, though,  were a little on the no frills side but adequate.  The assigned parking space is super convenient. <br/><br/>The building looks like it's in the midst of an remodel itself.. so the common areas are a little rough.<br/><br/>Convenient area.. a short walk to Amoeba Music and Arclight Cinemas on Sunset Blvd.<br/><br/>I recommend this for sure!",clean

"The space is even nicer than the photos! We stayed for a month in Eyal's studio. Everything was clean, from the furniture to the amenities. We would like to thank Mark, the building manager and main point of contact during our stay, as well. He was very friendly and easy to communicate with. Highly recommended if you're visiting Hollywood!",clean
"Sneaky! Sneaky! Be careful with the 30 Day Cancelation on this rental. The owner WILL TRY to get away with taking your money. BUT this is exactly why we use Airbnb. To protect us when someone is being less than honest. I'll explain what happened with my situation, but i also want to give an HONEST REVIEW of this place. The place is exactly as it looks in the pictures, but it is very small and I didn't realize just HOW SMALL till i arrived. This place would be great if you are staying a week or less, but i originally needed it for four months. The fridge is very very tiny, there is no stove to cook and the sink is so tiny washing your hands is hard to do, let alone washing any dishes. There is also not enough space to prepare food, so the apt just wasn't a good fit for me. However, if you do only need a place for a few days, the location is central to everything touristy. I enjoyed being able to walk most places, as you are between two very busy streets, Sunset Blvd and Hollywood blvd. Another bonus is the parking spot. This is a HUGE bonus in this area. Other positives: 1). The bldg manager Mark lives in the building. 2). The other tenants are very nice and friendly. 3). It is a pet friendly bldg. 4). It is affordable for the area. 5). Always had hot water. Negatives: 1). The area is very very LOUD AT ALL HOURS. If you can't sleep through noise then this is not the place for you. (To be honest, this didn't bother me as i could sleep in the middle of traffic if I'm tired. But i know it was mentioned in other reviews, so it is something to be aware of.) 2). You should be careful walking around the area after dark. It is Hollywood, so locals know this, but if your not from the area, then how would you know this? (But walking around during the daylight is more than fine.) 3). Very small space. 4). No kitchen and extremely tiny sink in kitchen. 5). Wasn't the cleanest when i moved in, but I've also seen dirtier hotels, so this is a judgement call. I mentioned the bldg manager Mark, as he is who you will be seeing and mostly dealing with. He is very nice and good. Any questions or needs will be addressed immediately, and he will go out of his way to make you comfortable in the place. ....... In fact, after maybe two weeks of living in the apt i messaged Eyal to let him know the apt wasn't a fit for me and i would have to look for something else. (Other than the space and kitchen issues I mentioned above, the mattress was very uncomfortable.) Mark immediately contacted me and offered to switch up the mattress, which he did the next day. After this, I...",location
"I stayed here for months and I really enjoyed it. Room is clean and there is pretty much everything you need. TV with cable, fast internet speed, and good A/C, and good hot/cold water in the shower were all huge pluses for me. Having a designated parking space and occasional cleaning service (optional with additional charge but it was worth it) were also great. Mark, building manager, was also very helpful and I cannot thank enough for his help. <br/>Overall it was a great stay and having stayed for almost half a year, I think anyone would enjoy staying here for couple days to months.",clean

"Linda was a great host, along with her hubby. Caring, friendly, helpful with anything we needed; movies, directions, suggestions. Great coffee! My brother and I were traveling together so we each had our own bedroom, along with a joined patio/porch overlooking the canyon vistas, and our own bathroom.  Linda provided nice touches like water and glasses, soap supplies, mini-frig, umbrellas (yes, it actually rained while we were in Topanga Canyon!), and shopping bags. No cable TV, but oodles of movies. ",location
"Linda and her beautiful house in the canyon are a hidden gem! She and her husband were so welcoming, my wife and I felt like old friends, not like visitors. Linda is an amazing artist and communicated great beforehand. Once we've arrived she showed heartwarming hospitality. The guestrooms and the house are tastefully furnished and have beautiful art on the walls. The bedding, the private deck and Lindas coffee are breathtaking. The private entrance is a huge plus.",location

We had a nice stay at Brendan & Stina's. They are lovely people who if I had more time I would really have liked to have gotten to know better! The location is incredibly ideal as it is very close to the metro and overall in a central location for Los Angeles. The kitchen and bathroom were a little messy but it was understandable as they have recently welcomed a little one into their home and are preoccupied. Brendan & Stina gave incredibly detailed and fantastic advice in all their communications and are very friendly and respectful.,clean
"This place is really, really convenient because of its proximity to the Vermont/ Santa Monica Metro station. The neighbourhood is safe, so even if you're returning home late in the evening, it's never a problem. <br/><br/>As for the room, it's a little small but nice and cosy, and Brendan and Stina are great hosts.",location

"The location was perfect -- near public transport and easy to find. Self check-in with a lock box is always easy. Brendan and Stina were super nice and welcoming.<br/><br/>I do have to say that without air conditioning in August it was pretty hot in the room. The fan provided made the room cool enough for me to sleep, but I think the average person would have been uncomfortable. Neighbors were noisy, but that's to be expected in a big city.<br/><br/>Overall good stay!",location
"Very close to the metro station (around a 2 minute walk).<br/>Despite the lack of AC, a fan was provided which was definitely enough to keep the room cool.<br/>Considering the price, this was a great deal! The room was small but that was fine because all I needed was a place to shower and sleep.",clean
"I never met the hosts in person and Iâm sure by all accounts they are lovely friendly people, but unfortunately the only word I can come up with to summarize the place is âsqualidâ. I am NOT a clean freak or a picky guest by any stretch, Iâm the kinda guy that just ignores a hair in my food, stain on the bedding or even the odd toenail clipping on the floor in an Airbnb stay. But I met my match in this stay. In the bathroom there were used tampons piled to the brim in the bathroom trash that werenât cleared over a 2 day stay. There was also a strong odor of stale urine in the bathroom where people had missed the bowl and it just got left to absorb into the flooring and there was a thick layer of orange goop (which must have taken years of neglect to build) with pubic hair in it on the kitchen board where the (stained and unwashed) glasses, plates and utensils were kept. In response to a previous criticism about cleanliness the hosts responded that they are âkinda messyâ. Messy to me means cluttered and untidy, when things are unclean and unhygienic âkinda messyâ doesnât really do it justice. Similarly they responded that private areas are kept clean, which I also have to disagree with. Whilst the private space was notably better and of an acceptable standard to me, there were clumps of thick matted black hair attached to the base of the fan and a few loose black hairs were also on the pillow and in the bed. Everything just felt a little bit like you didnât wanna touch it and I left the shower feeling somehow dirtier than I went into it. The body soap ran out on morning of day two and still wasnât replaced when I left two days later. Itâs a two rather than one star from me because if, like me, you can overlook these factors and still enjoy your time in LA, every other area was on point about this stay: Check in was granted very early to really help me out and the place is in a GREAT location and pretty safe neighborhood. The vibe at the home was very friendly and welcoming: The offer to take anything we wanted from the fridge was a nice gesture, but when I picked up the orange juice and went to use it, it was over TWO YEARS past itâs sell by date. Two thirds of the food was old - just throw it out why hold onto that stuff? I didnât even want to put my own food in that fridge because it felt like the things around it would contaminate it. The price of the place was undeniably good. Itâs just a shame they let themselves down so badly in this one area. I know that you get what you pay for but depriving your guests of basic hygiene standards and making them...",clean

"We had a great experience !  Not only is the house beautiful, we loved the location and neighborhood as well.  Just what we were looking for.  The outdoor patio is a great place to unwind after a busy day.  Mike was extremely responsive and accommodating.  If given the opportunity, we would definitely stay at the house again !",location
"We came to LA for a family wedding.  We were looking for a space that would accommodate all 11 of us, including 5 kiddos, 8 years old and under.  Not only did this property meet every expectation we had, but truly exceeded it.  Despite our late arrival due to a delay at the airport, Mike was awaiting out arrival.  He gave us a thorough tour and we were instantly impressed with all the amenities, kid friendly spaces, and a very clean and artistically decorated space.  It was a heavenly retreat after long days at the beach, wedding, and Disney.  I have never seen a house more meticulously organized and managed.  There was plenty of room for us all and we enjoyed being able to run to several stores when we needed anything that were literally walking distance.  Kids loved the trampoline and the drawer of toys and games.  The outdoor space is wonderful and the beds so comfy.  Some of the little ones wanted to sleep with us and Mike instantly pulled out two air mattresses to meet our needs.  He checked in every few days to see if we needing anything.   I have to say that our vacation and family trip for the wedding would not have so memorable or comfortable if it had not been for this property that we stayed in.... Thanks Mike!!!",clean
"I must say Mike is a very nice guy, introduced all thing very clearly kitchen, washing machine/dryer, the house is very beautiful and comfortable, we did several dinners here including BBQ in one night, location is also good, several minutes away from supermarket by driving. Everything is fantastic, good memory!",clean
"Mike made us feel very welcome. He was great with communication by email, text and phone. He even offered to give us a tour by FaceTime prior to our visit. He was very prepared with instructions for the house and listings of nearby restaurants and attractions. He was also available throughout our visit to answer any questions. The home was beautiful! All accommodations were as listed and exceeded our expectations. The neighborhood was nice. Location was great as far as it's proximity to downtown LA and surrounding areas.",location
Our second stay at this amazing home!  Our hosts thought of everything that we might need.  The beautiful home also has a lovely outdoor living area.<br/><br/>The location provided easy access to the area.,location
Mike and Conzuelo have a beautiful house in a great neighborhood! The pictures really don't do it justice. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat.,location
This Silver Lake home is lovely - open and spacious and beautifully decorated. The master suite is large and bright. Every room has its own bathroom. The entertainment areas are large and comfortable. Our granddaughter had so much fun on the trampoline. This is a wonderful place to stay.,location
"Mike and Conzuelo were great! Very communicative, helpful, and responsive. The space was fantastic and nicely located. We had a family of 7 and felt especially at home. Would definitely stay again!",location
"Mike and Conzuelo are true hosts. When the Woolsey fire sent us scrambling, we found sanctuary and support in their home. Not only did they open their doors to our oddball crew, they truly extended their best to make us feel at home. Their positivity, receptiveness, and hospitality made the difference for us during an extremely anxious week. We laughed and rested- two things we hadn't anticipated due to the nature of our visit. The resulting ease of mind we gained through our brief stay helped float us into a smoother transition back home. I cannot truly capture their generosity in this review, I'm still in awe, busy reflecting on the positive impact it has had. We truly appreciated every effort they put into creating a home that could be shared. Nothing but our deepest thanks!",host
"We were had a large family of 8 (4 kids, 4 adults) stay in this beautiful house and loved it as our base in LA. The house itself is even more amazing than in the pictures, and we felt so at home and had everything we could possible need. The neighborhood is lovely and walk-able, with a few restaurants, grocery store, wine shop, cafe, etc. nearby. And a quick drive to more restaurants, shops, parks, and sights. We split up across the four bedrooms (each with its own bathroom), and everyone had plenty of privacy and space, and loved being able to cook and share meals in the great kitchen and dining room. Lastly, Mike was very organized and reliable and easy to communicate with. Highly recommend--5 stars!",location
"The home was everything we hoped for, nice location, well kept, great amenities   The personal attention provided by the owners went even further in assuring our experience was perfect.  We highly recommend staying here. We hope to come back ourselves.  Thank you Mike and Consuelo",location
This is a dream experience and I cannot say enough about hosts Mike and Conzuela! Being at their beautiful home is like being on. Retreat only right I. The middle of beautiful Silver Lake!,location
"Their place is fantastic. You can tell they put a lot of thoughts in their home and itâs well maintained. Itâs very spacey for 6 people, got a lot of amenities, cool decoration, great utilities.<br/><br/>The location is wonderful too, close to Pasadena, Universal as well as food (k town).<br/><br/>I would definitely consider their place again if I have a large group, highly recommended.",location
"Beautiful home, extremely well located, and very helpful hosts!",location
"Absolutely loved our stay at Mikeâs house. It is such a aesthetically pleasing place with a lot of thoughtful details. The communication with Mike was very smooth - he did a virtue walkthrough before our stay which was super helpful. Restaurants, stores and Whole Foods are few minutes away. Canât wait to come back again!",location
"Me and my friends had a great experience staying at Linda's place. This is a great location to unwind and relax. Linda was a great host and took good care of us for the time we were there. If you are looking for a quiet place to relax and have a good time in a great environment, this is the place.",location
"We had a very warm welcome from Linda and Ron. They are both wonderful people and take great care of their house, which is why it is important for people to respect it and keep it clean as well. It was perfect for us as we could go to the beach during the day and come back to a quiet, nice place to spend the evening and night. Topanga is in our opinion the best place to be at. At first we considered staying in Santa Monica but those places are not anywhere near as nice and they are in noisy neighborhoods. It is worth it to drive 20 minutes and come back to a nice place with friendly people, and Linda and Ron are exactly that. Thank you for a great stay!",location
"The views are incredible and the apartment has enough entertainment that you do not want to leave. Sunsets, sunrises, and the Hollywood sign are beautiful.",location
"Beautifull House and rooms, comfortable beds, huge bathroom and huge Patio. Extremely clean and only about 20 min. from Santa Monica. Wonderfull roundview to the Topanga State Park. My family an me - we stayed in Lindas house for 5 days and really enjoyed it. We absolutely recommend Linda and would come again anytime.",clean
We stayed at Linda's and Ron's house for two nights and liked it very much. The location is absolutely stunning. The view out of the window reminded us of the South of France. Linda's house is very elegant and full of art work. Communication with Linda and Ron was very efficient which was good for us because we asked if we could stay less than 24 hours prior to our arrival. We would highly recommend this place. Many thanks to Linda and Ron.,location
"Linda was very kind and sweet with me and my family. She brought nice breakfast to our room every morning. That was special. <br/><br/>Those two rooms has an gorgeus view, were clean and cozy.<br/><br/>We had also items for the beach, towels, bags, etc.<br/><br/>Topanga is so quiet and calm. I will defintelly recomend it.",location
"We loved our stay. Felt like we were guests in a home, not in a typical Airbnb. Everything was fresh and clean and modern.  We will definitely plan on staying there again.",clean
Fantastic House- Great Views- Deer in the Garden as well.<br/>The house's musical theme fits in perfectly to the house and the location.<br/>We had a fantastic stay here and i would reccomend it to anyone.,location
"The place is just as described, terrific views and just perfect for anyone looking for tranquility but staying close to the action.",location
Craigs place is awesome! We stayed here years ago and came back with our baby boy only to find it even more lovely than we remembered! Awesome location. We will definitely be staying here again!,location
"Our family of four loved Craig's plant-filled, sun-drenched house.  The decor is fun and casual; the views are as lovely as they appear in photos.  We enjoyed being within walking distance of shops, restaurants, and hiking trails. Craig is a generous and accommodating host!",location
"This home is immaculate.<br/><br/>From the moment you walk in and are greeted by his grand piano, you can tell, this person has taste. Not just any taste, but a particularly exquisite taste. The pictures do not do this home justice. The home is truly unbelievable.<br/><br/>Letâs first start with the view. Out the living room and into the balcony, youâre immersed in the Hollywood Hills. In the distance is DTLA and a quarter turn to the right is the iconic HOLLYWOOD sign.. surrounded by lush, beautiful green.<br/><br/>Next, the Master bedroom. That bed is heavenly. The moment you lay down, you become immersed in tranquility. The bed: firm, but gently cushioning; the blanket: soft, heavy, but comforting. All in all, it is a space to find peace at rest.<br/><br/>â<br/><br/>This home is by far one of the best places Iâve gotten to stay.<br/><br/>Tysm, Craig for this wonderful experience.",location
"Prefer to drive up narrow winding hilly roads, so do not rent a big car.  Lots of seasoning stuff in the cupboard so check before you buy your own. <br/>Prepare to get a glimpse of deer.  We saw two on the hill right outside our door.  Wonderful sunset sky.",location
Great landscape! Nice hospitality!!,location
"Craig's place is beautifully set in the Hollywood hills with amazing views of LA, the Hollywood sign and the ocean. The house itself is charming and stylish with heaps of character. We'll definitely be coming back!",location
"Craig's place is beautiful inside and out, the view from the deck is so breathtaking.  Craig is a really great host, he was always on hand if we needed anything",location
Craigâs place was awesome.  The views and all the musical instruments were very inspiring.  Hope to come back soon.,location
Craigs house is as described and the view is great. It was very clean and very individually decorated. We felt very comfortable and like to come back.,clean
Craig is a great host. Responds quickly. Has great clear directions. The house is absolutely amazing with an amazing view. Our teenage kids loved the instruments. Great home.,location
"Where to begin?  We rented this home for a week for my parents to stay in while visiting my husband and I, here in LA. They are music and history lovers and are both in their 70's now.  They report that the beds, pillows and shower are all very comfortable which is important for them.  <br/><br/>The entire home has such an awesome creative, fun energy and we all enjoyed looking at the many great books and Hollywood memorabilia throughout the place.  So interesting!  My stepdad's favorite part was playing amazing vinyl on Craig's record player.  He was on it within the first 15 minutes of entering the house, lol.  Great record collection!  My mother thoroughly loved being surrounded by gorgeous house plants and bamboo floors as well.  <br/><br/>Very comfortable, open and energizing space.  The views are incredible at any time of the day/night.  So relaxing to sit on the deck with a french-pressed coffee while watching birds fly by at eye level!  Beautiful vacation feeling.  <br/><br/>We will recommend Craig's home to family/friends and will likely book again when friends come to LA for a visit.  Thank you very much, Craig, for giving us all a unique and special vacation memory.  We all love your great home!",location
"Great place with an amazing view. Very clean, decorated with taste. We loved every single details. Craig did everything to accommodate us from the moment we arrived to the moment we departed. Great communication. Too bad we could not stay longer.",location
An amazing home with an intimate vibe & fantastic view of the Hollywood hills. Great spot!,location
"This was a choice location. It was lovely, clean. Our host was as gracious as could be. Informative, available, if we needed. The space was very comfortable. Perfect for 3-4 people or just a couple. The day bed provided a very comfortable bed for our adult daughter and the bedroom was quite comfortable. Sandra was willing to be flexible on check in and check out. We would stay there again in a heartbeat! Highly recommended",clean
"Sandra was a perfect host - welcoming, available whenever I needed any assistance and responded quickly to all my questions. Her guest house was exactly as described and presented on the site, but I would also add quite and private. We had absolutely everything we needed during our stay. Location is amazing, really nice neighborhood and accessible both by car and on foot. I will definitely recommend Sandra and her guesthouse to my friends travelling to LA.",location
"This was for my boss, he thought the neighborhood was nice and it was conveniently close to our offices.  Sandra was easy to communicate with and she responded quickly!",location
"Sandra's place is fantastic--larger than shown in the pictures, clean, artsy, nice bed and shower, and the perfect location for visiting the LA County Museum of Art and the La Brea Tar Pits. We didn't get to meet Sandra in person, but communicated via text and email with no problem. Also a good deal for the area. Highly recommended!",location
"If you are looking for a relaxing and recharging stay in a beautiful place that is still close to LA, Linda's place is perfect! We (a couple with a young child) truly enjoyed our stay. Linda and Ron are so kind and caring!",location
"Linda's place was a fantastic spot for my wife, son and I to use as our home base for a few days. From the back private porch you feel like you're in the forest looking out at the trees. Bedrooms were comfortable and we made use of the generously supplied beach gear. Thanks Linda!",location
"Linda is an amazing host and gives just the right amount of privacy. The rooms are incredible and the view is spectacular! If you are hesitant about staying in a private room vs renting an entire house, please don't be worried! This experience changed my outlook on it for sure! Linda is super helpful and such a good soul! 10/10 would recommend! :)",location
Place does have breathtaking view of the Topanga hills. Youâll find your host to be most courteous and professional.,location
Linda is probably the best host of any airbnb I have stayed at.  She went above and beyond to ensure my family and I had a comfortable stay.  Her house is beautiful and serene; we truly felt like we had our own house in the canyon.  I would definitely stay here again. ,host
Linda & Ronâs home is lovely and beyond beautiful. They provide a clean and charming home that both feels fancy and laid back. Waking up to the view was perfect. Our vacation was complete by visiting topanga!,location
This is an incredible home. The instruments and views to the most comfortable beds. I canât thank Craig enough for a wonderful visit and he was so easy to communicate with along the way. We will definitely be back.,location
"A lovely experience. Your place is in a nice, central location -- and your home is very attractive! Thanks, Sandra.",location
"Location, location ,location!!! Sandra's place has easy access to anywhere u wanna go in LA. My family had an amazing first time airbnb experience. Will definitely recommend to anyone who is traveling to LA. And we will come back again...",location

VERY GOOD LOCATION<br/>THE PLACE WAS BIGGER THAN PICTURES<br/>IT HAS ITS OWN PATIO AND PRIVATE ENTERY<br/>VERY NICE HOSPITABLE <br/>WILL BOOK AGAIN WHEN IN LA <br/>VERY CONVENIENT LOCATION<br/>,location
"Craig has a thoughtfully decorated home with a stunning view. The property is well maintained, sparkling clean and comfortable. The sunsets are beautiful to view from the balcony.  We also saw a cute deer grazing below. Craig was a responsive host. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would highly recommend this artsy home.",location
"Wow, where do I begin?! First of all, seeing the Hollywood sign was a bucket list experience for my daughter and when we saw this unbelievable location we lunged at the opportunity! I literally cried during a walk through of the house because it was so breath taking. Understand that the photos do this entire residence absolutely NO justice. The view, the architecture, the instruments, the houseplants and greenery, the endless amount of things to do in less than a 5-10 minute drive was all worth while. Craig had quick and efficient responses, answered every concern thoroughly and was nothing short of amazing and extremely accommodating to say the very least. You truly have to see this to believe it!",location
"Craig's place is great!  If you are a music lover, bonus!  Easy access to Hollywood and the Hollywood hills hikes.  Super fun.  Great views.  Had a great time.",location
"I truly enjoyed staying in this lovely guest house.  It is very spacious and had everything we needed.  From the super comfortable king-sized bed, to the full-sized kitchen and patio area, we couldn't have asked for a better place.   Sandra was a complete doll.  She made everything so easy and provided us with recommendations on where to go and how to get around.  And when we were having trouble with the coffee maker, a new one was brought to us that day (with a new toaster to boot!).  We would return in a heartbeat.     ",clean
"Sandra was extremely welcoming and very nice! Her home was super cozy and beautiful. It was bigger than I'd imagined it to be. Everything was even better than it was listed! The shower and bed were wonderful! The area outside was a great place to have coffee in the morning! Sandra made us feel very welcome! The neighborhood was safe and very upscale. Great location and close to everything. Recommended for everyone, would like to come back and stay another time! Thank you, Sandra :)",location
Sandra's place is exactly as described in the listing.  It was a nice private place in an equally nice neighborhood. She allowed us to check-in couple of hours earlier than the posted time. I highly Recommend this place.,location
Sandra's guesthouse was roomy and conveniently located near everything we had planned for our short two day stay.  Her father who lives in the main house greeted us and showed us around before settling in.  I enjoyed the tasteful decor and character of the home.  The king size bed was so comfortable and there was plenty of closet and storage space for our private items and belongings.  Although the house is on a busy street we barely heard the traffic from the back unit.  Thank you for providing a wonderful place Sandra!,location
"We loved Sandra's guest house.  The arrival was very easy and Sandra accommodated our arrival time with no problems.  She had the house ready to go and even had a nice little welcome treat.  The guesthouse is very comfortable in both space and furnishings.  Location is prime.  Safe neighborhood - 10 minutes to downtown, 10 minutes to the beach.<br/>Had a great stay!",location
"We needed a last minute stay in LA and Sandra made it incredibly easy! The place was  well suited for the three of us (3 women in their 20s). It was conveniently located near LACMA and we managed to make our way around with a metro bus and some Ã¼ber-ing. We didn't have a car so I can't comment on ease of parking, but buses were nearby. The rooms were clean and the layout made them feel more spacious. I think the best part was how easy Sandra made everything -- she gave us an early check-in when we asked. Her father let us in and was very sweet. Would recommend to a friend, particularly one with car access. If you're limited to metro, you may want to try a little closer to downtown, but then you lose the easy access to museums and such. So it depends on your needs.",clean
"I want to move here! It was a very charming and spacious place in a great central location to all amenities. Sandra was very accommodating to me and my three friends, leaving water and apples for us in the fridge, and being flexible for checking in. She was quick and sweet to communicate with and like I mentioned earlier, the place was adorable! If I'm ever in the area again I won't hesitate to stay somewhere else!!! You're the best Sandra!",clean
Lindaâs house that she and her husband made which is decorated with her art  is nestled in a beautiful valley in Topanga Canyon. They are extremely thoughtful and generous people.,location
An excellent house in a great location. It had everything I needed. Couldnât recommend it more strongly.,location
Amazing views and wonderful instruments available to use! Clean and all the amenities you need.,location
"Craig's home was charming and cozy with amazing views. It is located in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood. Access to major highways, attractions, restaurants and supermarkets was only a short drive away but it still felt very secluded. Communication with this host was quick and pleasant. Craig went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable during our stay. Highly recommended - my family and I would gladly stay here again.",location
"Incredibly cool place to stay a night or extended weekend! The balcony and view of the Hollywood hills was the reason we chose this spot, and even with a rainy and hazy afternoon, the view was still amazing! Highly recommend and would love to come back for another trip.",location
Highly recommend!,clean
"Craig's place is a gem in the Hollywood hills! The view is priceless, and the grand piano instantly upgraded everything. It reminded me of my long-lost childhood dream of becoming a pianist. It was an incredible experience playing some Debussy looking over the hills shimmering in the golden sunset.",location
Such a cool house/location! Would highly recommend!,location
"Great space, amazing communication, awesome views. A must stay!",location
Was the perfect spot for our staycation.  Very tranquil with wonderful views!,location

"Linda and Ron are exceptional hosts.  Their home is beyond beautiful and has a stunning view of the canyon.  Nice, quiet, and relaxing atmosphere.  For breakfast, check out Cafe 27.",location
Linda and Ron made us feel welcome and comfortable in every way. It was easy to come and go as we pleased and we were stunned by the gorgeous views and easy comfort we felt here. It is a bit of a windy drive up into the hills but it is worth it for the peace and beautiful flora and fauna. We had everything we needed and Linda gave us the best tips on where to go out for entertainment and meals. Comfortable beds and quiet rooms. Highly recommended. Weâll come again!,location
Magic from top to bottom. Warm and sincere. The only thing nicer than the view was the people. Weâll be back!,location
"Lindaâs place was absolutely beautiful. Linda is probably the coolest host youâll ever meet. Her and Ron are very hospitable, very kind, and very accommodating. The location is amazing.   Full of beautiful nature, and the mountains are absolutely amazing to experience. I recommend this place 100%  for the architecture, the art, and the beauty of living in nature. Plus Linda has great tea selections!",location
"This place has a stunning view ! Linda and Ron put so much detail into making everything so cozy. The beds have plenty of pillows and the mattress is memory foam (most Airbnbâs skimp out on nice beds). Two cute cats that came and said hi, morning coffee and tea service was a plus. There is a computer in one of the rooms that was helpful to plan the rest of the trip. They also have a ton of beach stuff and extra towels that was nice to have. Mini fridge in the closet and the bathroom came with everything you need. The house is filled with gorgeous art that looks like an art gallery , and there is a cool private entrance with a Bridge that was always fun to come home to.",location
Beautiful place with a wonderful view. Linda is super hospitable and helpful. Everything was very clean and comfortable,clean
"I had the most magical stay at Lindas home. It was a stay I will never forget. To be so immersed in nature was wonderful. Linda was so thoughtful and generous and was really there to help me with anything that I needed.  Sitting on the terrace at night time looking at the stars was breathtaking. I highly recommend staying here, its truly a very special place to experience. I will most definitely return!",location
"Had a very relaxing and peaceful stay with Linda in her home. The scenic drive is about 10-15 min from the shore and the house is nestled in the mountains so itâs very calm and quiet. Linda is so thoughtful and provided me with coffee and (nondairy) milk every morning. The space is actually 3 different rooms within the main house: a bedroom with a patio, a large bathroom and another bedroom with a desk (I didnât end up using but it was also spacious). The bedroom I used was very comfortable, I slept like a baby the entire time. The house itself is very well decorated with lots of great artwork. Linda provides a list of recommendations on the area of things to do and places to eat. She also checks in daily. It was a great stay. She has a decent amount of directions for staying so if youâre looking for something more casual, I would consider staying elsewhere. But for me, the place was perfect.",location
"The neighborhood was great and the location was excellent. Less than a mile walk from the LAMCO, which was one of our main reasons for the visit. Sandra was very helpful and responsive before and during our visit. She even let us park our car at the place before we could check in. <br/><br/>The place itself was very cute and clean. I definitely plan to stay here for future trips!",clean
"The house is beautiful, with the most incredible views. It has such a nice energy, likely because Craig is so thoughtful and caring. So much thought and care has been put into each touch around the house. This is truly a special place. We truly enjoyed our stay.",location
I seriously believe that the pictures donât capture how breathtaking this place truly is to its fullest extent. I highly recommend for those who are searching for a comfy home with great view and to all music lovers. Craig is a very friendly host and very informative. Iâd love to come back in the future!,location
"If you're traveling to Los Angeles you MUST stay at Craig's place. Not only does the house have breathtaking views, but every space is filled with personal touches that make it feel like the coziest home away from home. The house is also tucked away on a hillside so while it's quiet and secluded, it's also not too far from the action of Hollywood/ LA proper below. That said, my friends and I barely left the property since the kitchen was filled with everything we needed and the deck was big enough for all of us to sprawl out and read, nap, work, etc. all day. Added bonus: the record player and HUGE record collection -- we absolutely took full advantage of both.<br/><br/>Craig was an excellent host and communicator. He answered our questions promptly, was accommodating, and was super personable . The house was incredibly clean and we felt completely safe the entire time.<br/><br/>I will definitely stay here again!",location
Unbelievable views of Hollywood. Cool energy and close to most everything in the city,location

Clean, Wifi worked, one guaranteed spot for parking (plenty close by).  We basically just slept, but I'm sure others can take advantage of many appliances there.  We left our toothbrush there when we left and Sandra offered to mail it to us!  Nice.",clean
"Sandra's Guesthouse was just as described: clean, quiet, spacious, artsy decor. The comfortable king bed had nice quality linens. There are plenty of towels, plus essential pantry items were thoughtfully provided for the full kitchen.  It was unusually hot and humid when we were in LA, so we were very glad that a freestanding AC unit was available. Sandra's father (he lives on the property and checked us in) helped us install it so that the bedroom could be kept cool.  A portable fan which would help bring cool night air in would be a wonderful addition!  <br/>Communication with Sandra was quick and easy, via website, text, and phone.",clean

"The house was well worth the money. Very central location close to everything. Only a few miles away from Rodeo Dr., Hollywood Blvd, the Grove shopping center and the farmers market. Also only took about 15-20 minutes to get to Santa Monica Pier. We felt very secure in this house. It was behind a locked gate and high concrete walls. The beds were amazing. Slept better in the bed here than I sleep in my own bed at home! Sandra was very friendly and easy to deal with. Very quick with responses and willing to go out of her way to make us feel welcomed. Thank you for having us Sandra!!!",location
"The place is indeed charming and location is great. Easy to go to The Groove or the Tar Pits (5 min by car) and close to Hollywood Bowl and The Griffith Observatorium (20 min by car).<br/><br/>The house is in the back of the main house, and it's quiet. Your car can be parked in front of the gate, it's not a garage but it will stay out of the street.<br/><br/>The house was a little too hot, even with heat off, but it was the last days of a hot summer. The bedroom has a portable air conditioning, but the rest of the house will remain hotter than the street, even at night. Probably very confortable in the winter.<br/><br/>The house has many places to store luggage, the kitchen has everything you need, the bathroom is great too. Everything is colorful.<br/><br/>We have not seen Sandra, but her father was there to help. He was really kind everytime we needed him. He explained everything about the house and even gave us tips about parking in The Groove and places to eat around.<br/><br/>The wi-fi signal was very weak in the bedroom. We could only get Internet on the TV room.<br/><br/>We think we made the right choice as this house was a great place to stay in Los Angeles and we saved some money by making breakfast and dinner on the kitchen, instead of eating outside.",location
"We had a wonderful stay at Lindaâs home. She was there to greet us upon arrival and show us around the guest area. The rooms were very comfortable with stunning views of the canyon. The bathroom was huge and beautiful. The patio was just awesome. Linda provided tea and coffee in the morning, and offered some tips on where to go in Topanga and closer to the beach. Would definitely recommend staying here!",location
"Beautiful home, great hospitality",location
"Nice place, great hosts. Good communication. The place is very peaceful and clean.<br/>The neighborhood is friendly and fun. Far from everything though.<br/>We loved our breakfasts at the patio. Linda provides coffee which is 100%!!!<br/>Would recommend",clean
Awesome place. Great view and a great host. Would recommend this place to anyone looking to stay around the area.,location
"Location has an awesome view from the back shaded patio. Rooms are ample size and bedding very quality. Linda, the host, was very attentive and respectful. There is no microwave and computer runs slow.",location
"Great hosts, a very nice home tucked away in a Canyon; tasteful and whimsical art gracing the rooms, many pieces by the owner herself; a direct view on the local nature scene, easy access to Malibu, Santa Monica, Hollywood. Our hosts made us feel at home, and made sure we made the most of our too brief visit to the area. We recommend and hope it will be available, should we return to the area.",location
We had such a wonderful time Lindaâs  guest rooms. The view is out of this world and her hospitality is top notch.,location
Couldnât have picked a better place to stay on my first trip to LA. Craigâs place is an absolute gem! Great location with unreal views. Comfy beds and furniture. Craig is a stellar host and his place is a 10/10 all the way around. If youâre reading this... book it now.,location
Linda is a wonderful host and her place is so beautiful and cozy! We had a excellent experience.,location

Linda did an excellent job of creating a comfortable and enjoyable experience. Coming back to her place was a highlight and set the tone for our trip. Thank you for having us in your fabulous home Linda!,location
"This was the quintessential California-living experience we were looking for and we found it here at Lindaâs and Ronâs beautiful, artistic home in the Topanga Canyon. They obviously know what theyâre doing because they have thought of everything to make oneâs stay as comfortable as can be.  I felt right at home with the supportive bed and pillows, and even with magnifying mirrors in the bathroom, just as I have in my own home.  Linda is reassuringly attentive and appropriately  communicative starting from the moment reservations were confirmed and throughout our entire stay. <br/>Now, I will say that you have to be somewhat adventurous to navigate your way up to their house. Make sure you set your (Hidden by Airbnb) or Apple maps on your cellphone to guide you the entire way to their house BEFORE you  head up into the canyon so that it will continue to guide you even without cell service (there is no cell service up in the canyon). Otherwise, you need to be a good reader of written directions which Linda has painstakingly prepared, which also works. <br/>This was such a delightful experience that my husband, who usually is not keen with booking Airbnbs, was very happy here and would come here again!",location
"A lovely airbnb experience. The place is very spacious, quiet and makes you feel very secured. The location is perfect and close to everything - Starbucks, Whole Foods, CVS, Farmer's Market, The Grove, beach, etc.<br/>Her father who lives next door welcomed us, showed us around and gave us a lot of useful tips to stay there for a few days. Free parking was appreciated. The entire place was perfect and my family just loved staying here! I didn't get to meet Sandra in person, but my family did, and they told me Sandra was very friendly and helpful (thanks for laundry info!) . We would definitely plan on staying here again should we ever return to LA!<br/><br/>",location
"Sandras flat was just perfect! Good location to go everywhere in L.A. We had a car so it took us only about 30-40 minutes to spots like Venice or the Hollywood hills. The guesthouse was clean and we had everything we needed.<br/>If you want to spend a perfect time in a calm and clean getaway, then we would definitely recommend to book Sandras guesthouse.",clean
"Very accomodating,  Sandra and her father arranged for folding large table for Dinner, which fits well in the living-room.  <br/>San Vicente Blvd. is a good location between La Cienega and Fairfax.  <br/>Bedroom as per picture.

"I am very disappointed with the guesthouse.  It is old and needs a good renovation. It is also not well taken care of and not clean.  When we arrived and were shown in there were rat droppings all over the house.  Sandra's father saw them, picked them up, acted as if it was not a big deal and said that is was because the place had been empty for 5 days.  Obviously the house had not been cleaned after the last occupant left.  There were hairs in the bathroom as well as in the bedroom, not to mention a good size spider web in the bathroom with a dead and dried spider in it.  When we called Sandra that evening she told me it had  never happened before and that she would take care of it the next day, which she did. But my friend did not sleep all night expecting a rat to come out any time.  Also the door to the house did not lock, although the metal screen door outside did.  The photos make the place look very fresh and cheerful.  Unfortunately it did not match our experience.  We are planning a trip to New York in May and I was thinking of using Airbnb, but I am having second thoughts now.  ",clean
"Where do i start? Iâve always wanted the Hollywood hills experience but I never found the right stay. As soon as I shift the map locator on the hills this beautiful home pops up. Thereâs obviously a lot of houses on the hills, BUT, do they have this view? NO! As soon as I clicked the photos I decided yes without viewing the rest of the photos. Itâs exactly what Iâve wanted in my past stays in LA. Some Airbnbâs are just homes but this house is much more than a home. Itâs the perfect place to relax and enjoy breath taking views. My main goal in booking is views. You can raise a finger and feel as if you can touch the Hollywood sign and to the left of you is the city of Angeles. It canât get any better. The patio felt like a out door room. Most of my stay was on the comfortable seating outside. All I wanted to do was stay in and enjoy the views. The home is very clean which is important especially during these times. Spot less clean with art all over. A record player with all of my favorite records was a plus! Coffee and a record playing in the morning is magic. The most beautiful Instruments scattered around giving the home such a unique great feel. The beds and sofas were very comfortable. In the hills living but steps away from everything needed. Which is perfect. Craig was such an amazing host! He made my stay such a great experience. He is the best host Iâve dealt with on Airbnb. He went above and beyond to make sure my dates were available and ready for me. He made the impossible possible for me. I honestly wonât look any where else when traveling back to LA. There is only one issue I had, and that was leaving. Donât think twice, BOOK!",location
"This home was beyond what we expected. It had everything we needed for our week stay. The ambiance of the home was so chill, quiet and we loved the style of the home. If you are a music lover this home is for you. From the amazing collection of vinyl records, the music art on the wall,  to the grand piano it was perfect. This home has a lot of amazing history and we are so glad we get to be apart of it. Craig was a great host and very responsive. We had a wonderful time in the home! Book it, you wonât be disappointed!",location

"Such a great stay, the family could not stop raving about it! What a view and very cozy. Youâll have a very memorable stay, itâs majestic. One note I wouldnât say it fits 6 comfortably, but 4 definitely. Either way we loved it.",location
Loved this place! I stayed here with my s/o and another couple and it was perfect for us all! I loved the view and the fact that there were two decks. It was also super clean and comfy. Craig was very kind and accommodating as well. Would definitely stay here again!,location

"I had always been fascinated by those houses hanging over the canyons of the Hollywood hills. Staying at  Craig's place was a bucket list item for me.  I had been on a two week motorcycle trip, mostly camping and thought I'd live like a celebrity for a night up in the hills.   The view is stunning,   little touches and decor,  it's a quick walk to the good stuff in Los Feliz or the Bronson caves. Did i mention the view??<br/><br/>I spent the majority of my time on the deck listening to Miles Davis and  enjoying some wine.  At the end of the night I didn't want to leave that deck, so i rolled out the sleeping bag on the day bed and enjoyed a memorable night under the stars. The bedrooms were tastefully decorated,  're want",location
Great place and wonderful views. Host was very responsive and accommodating,location
"What a beautiful spot! We loved reading and drinking our coffee on the deck, and the house had pretty much everything we needed to cook our meals. Super closeby to grocery stores and restaurants. Craig was also lovely to chat with, was super responsive, and his check-in instructions were detailed and thorough. Would love to stay at Craig's place again!",location
"Craig was a fantastic host. His place was both clean, charming and radiated creative energy. The views are also fantastic. Highly recommend staying here.",location
"The place is pure magic. I spent almost six weeks there and wish I could have stayed longer. The location is impeccable, tucked away on a winding street, but easy to get everywhere I wanted to go in LA. There are views of the Hollywood sign, the city below, and the ocean in the distance. The sunset from this vista was remarkable. This Airbnb was a big part of the reason my stay in LA was such a pleasure.<br/><br/>Every aspect about the house was inviting and comfortable for a longer term stay. Craig was a an attentive host and made the process simple. I look forward to staying there again.",location
"If you're looking for a sun-drenched creative retreat, this is the place! Gorgeous sunsets every evening, an expansive view, and a fun and eclectic house. The neighborhood turned out to be super convenient as well, with lots of natural beauty at your doorstep. Just be sure to bring your sleeping mask if you want to sleep in and maybe a small reading light if you don't use a Kindle, and get ready to relax and be inspired.",location
What an amazing and inspiring space. I spent a few months here working on creative projects and playing the piano. Craig is a great host and the place is an absolute gem. <br/>Enjoy!,location

The full kitchen was a requirement for us and everything was in working order - fridge, oven, microwave oven etc. There's plenty of empty space to store your belongings. We also enjoyed the table outside where we ate a lot of our meals. Thanks for a lovely stay!",location

"Dear Linda and Ron, thank you for welcoming us into your home. The location and views are stunning, the hosts are welcoming and Linda's art is very impressive, a surprisingly pleasant addition to the stay. <br/>I do want to mention a few suggestions/comments that may help future guests with the same needs/expectations as we had and maybe the hosts would be interested in making some tweaks. <br/>AC - The listing mentions AC availability on the property, but while it is on during the day (set at 78 degrees), it is not able to cool down the corner room upstairs, which has the larger bed. The room was so hot, that my husband and I had to stay in the 2nd room with a smaller bed, while my son stayed in the warmer room. We did open our windows in the evening, once the AC was off, but it took a few hours for the room to cool down completely. My son would not sleep with open windows, so I had to open everything after he fell asleep, as the fan alone did not provide comfort. I understand this issue because our in-laws house faces the same AC problem where it is cold enough downstairs but the one corner room upstairs which gets the most sun does not cool down even with AC on all night. In this case, I think it would help tremendously to have blackout curtains/shades that would cut down on how much heat that room accumulates during hot summer days. This, I feel, added the most to the discomfort in our stay, as it gets difficult to relax when one is not able to cool down.<br/>Windows - there are no privacy or blackout curtains/shades on the windows. While we really did enjoy the views, it was slightly uncomfortable to change in the room with wide open windows, as we could not know what/who all might be out there. However, a more major issue is that we are sensitive to waking up with the sunrise light, and it was a bit surprising to see that the rooms did not offer options to control early morning (pre-6am) light coming in. <br/>Closet - The smaller room with the computer desk had a closet to hang clothes but it was full of owner's stuff, so it appears it could not be used, therefore the rooms did not provide any place to hang up clothes.<br/>Sheets - flannel sheets are normally very comfortable, but more on a cold winter night rather than a hot summer night. In addition, my husband simply doesn't like them, so I do think that plain cotton/microfiber sheets might have been a more suited standard option for these beds. <br/>Thanks for taking my comments into consideration. Hope we're back on the West Cost sometime in the near future!",location
"Linda was a fantastic and warm host, and made our stay very comfortable and relaxed. Beds are super comfortable. The area cools down nicely at night so itâs not too hot to sleep. Solid and clean bathroom, beautiful terrace. The only caveat is that itâs a bit of a far drive from west LA. We booked the place last minute to visit friends so the drive could get a bit tiring. But if you want a mountain retreat with a short drive to the beach, this is perfectð¤©",location
"My stay at Lindaâs was great! Nice and quiet and they were very accommodating. If you are looking for a place out of the city I would highly recommend. Bring a sleep mask because it can be bright in the morning, but Linda is always available if you need her! Would stay again!",location

The amenities and furnishings are basic and well-maintained, and the location is convenient for Echo Park, Silver Lake, or a quick Lyft to downtown.",location

"This place is quirky and charming, with an extremely comfortable bed, lovely outdoor spaces, and a nice bathroom.  However, it is not air conditioned.  I've lived without airconditioning in Northern California for years; however, in our experience, was not in an area of LA which is comfortable without air conditioning in mid-June.  <br/><br/>Ultimately we had to move to a hotel for our second night because the over 90 degree heat made me faint/dizzy and we didn't want more serious health issues to develop.<br/><br/>We arrived at 9:30 PM, opened windows and turned on fans to cool the place down and stayed the first night without an issue. When we returned to the home at around 3PM the second day the interior of the home was in the mid 90s (based on the temperature gauge on one of the fans). Although we opened all the doors and windows it only cooled to 92 and we left because I felt faint.  <br/><br/>Once I stabilized/felt better we found a hotel room.  To give you a sense of the heat when we went back to the unit to collect our stuff and at 8PM at night the fan thermostat registered 86 degrees.  It likely would have been cooler had we left the doors and windows open, but we didn't want to leave the house unlocked.<br/><br/>Ultimately is a place I'd only recommend to others for the cool seasons.  In those months you will find it to be a secluded, quirky home minutes from tons of great restaurants and quirky stores in Silverlake.",location
"Really enjoyed my brief stay at Kate's place.  The pictures are accurate, it's a really nice looking home.  <br/><br/>Bed was super comfortable and the shower was great.  Kate responded very quickly and I was able to get into the home very easily with her instructions.<br/><br/>It's very warm in LA now so had to sleep with all of the windows open.  Unfortunately, the trash pick up sounded like they were in the house throwing around garbage cans.  But, these things happen.  Obviously, nothing about this is Kate's fault, just thought it should be mentioned.<br/><br/>I would still stay here again, very very nice place.<br/><br/>Highly recommended!",clean

Loved the property. A very beautiful little area and also quaint. The amenities were everything we would've needed. Wish I could stay forever.  ,location
"My husband and I loved our stay in Kate's place. The house felt cozy, quiet and secluded but still gave us easy access to everything we wanted to see and do. Kate was very accommodating and made sure we were set up with everything we needed. We would definitely stay here again in the future! ",location
She was great at communication. Any questions I had were answered right away,clean
"Kate's place was awesome! Super clean, quaint, and looked even better than in the photos. Kate was very easy to communicate with, and made sure my stay comfortable and issue-free. I would definitely recommend Kate's space to anyone looking for a quiet retreat on the eastside. ",clean
"Kate's place is quintessential Airbnb: it's the unique experience you're looking for.  The house is extremely cute and full of character, very nicely furnished, comfortable and easy to feel at home in while still being interesting and quirky.  It is exactly like the photos.  Communication and access was easy (I prefer this type of keycode system to using an actual key, which I don't have to worry about losing).  The location was perfect: quiet, very close to Elysian Park and Fix Coffee, in exactly the area I wanted to be in.  Easy access to highways and Sunset.  I would certainly recommend it for those who want to be tucked away in Echo Park.  ",location
A wonderful peaceful spot in LA. Sunshine and birds. A cool place to unwind for a day or 5. ,location
"We had a lovely stay at Kate's bungalow! The place itself is so charming and unique, and the neighborhood is safe and nestled into the hills which offered great views. We had a couple of questions for Kate when we first arrived, which she answered promptly. We loved the homey feel of the place, and were satisfied with its amenities. Thanks, Kate!",location
"Highly recommended staying here. Cozy, tucked away on a quiet street, surrounded by beautiful trees.  walking distance from one of L.A's hippest areas ;) also Kate was very nice and easy to reach. ",location
Second time staying at Kate's place. I love it there. So quiet and secluded and so cool. And that Nest thing for the temperature control is amazing.,location
"Kate's place provided an awesome, surreal, LA experience. It was just as it appeared in the pictures/description. The neighborhood was quiet and clean, and conveniently located to everywhere I planned to visit.<br/><br/>Our host was quick to respond whenever I texted her with questions throughout my stay, which made things even better. I'd definitely recommend this place to friends/family. ",clean
"I like big cities but I also like nature and peace and quiet. Kate's place was perfect. A clean, comfortable unique getaway right in the middle of a great hip area of Los Angeles . ",clean
This was our first Air BnB experience and is was awesome! The house was super cute and private and we had our own parking space. It was the perfect size for my husband and I and our teenage daughter. Bathroom was big enough for the two of us to put on makeup and fix our hair (2 mirrors) at the same time. The location was perfect...very easy and fast (even with LA traffic) to get to all the things we had planned! Sandra was amazing to work with and she responded quickly to my texts. Would stay here again. :),location
THis was my first time in LA and staying here made it even more special. This place is a bit of paradise. Hosts were awesome! They even make me coffee in the morning. I want to stay here again.,location
"I would highly recommend staying in the guest house. In fact, We would like to stay there again. We had an awesome time. If you are looking to get away and want your privacy, then I would strongly recommend this over any hotel any day. <br/><br/>We didn't do it, but thought about using Uber to get around. It is very close to great restaurants, comedy clubs, House of Blues and other venues.  <br/><br/>The neighborhood is great and the house and grounds are immaculate. The pictures really don't do it justice. There is a fountain in the courtyard that provides great ambient noise and the pool has water falls that also add to the ambience. At night, they had Christmas style lights on backyard trees and plants. The palm trees and plants made it feel tropical and secluded in the backyard while using the pool and jacuzzi. <br/><br/>They are very hospitable including maps of the neighborhood and directions to local spots to eat, etc on the night stand. The accommodations include an alarm clock, shower, fridge, washer, dryer, coffee machine, and toaster oven. <br/>",location
"We were so pleasantly surprised at how beautiful the property was. The pictures don't do it justice and it's lovely, tropical, and peaceful. The room is a modest size but with plenty of amenities which were much appreciated. We were glad to have a chance to use the pool area as well. Overall, we'd love to come back and highly recommend to anyone. William was easy to communicate with, fast in response, and flexible with our schedule.  ",location
"I can not ""rave"" enough about what excellent hosts William and Elizabeth are. They are extremely accommodating and very polite. They are very prompt in their responses to inquiries and really do a great job ensuring that all questions are answered. I was heading out for my first hot air balloon ride & cruise out of Long  Beach and just needed a place for the night. My flight got in early and they allowed me to check in a little ahead of time which I truly appreciated. <br/><br/>Upon arrival I was very impressed with the accommodations. The small cottage/room is the perfect space if traveling alone and would comfortably accommodate two adults. The pictures that you see are exactly what you get. However they fail to leave out all of the lovely extras that they include such as snacks and drinks. The hot tub, pool and outside patio were a heaven sent after traveling. Not. to mention the washer,dryer, coffee maker and ample toiletries.  <br/><br/>My drive from the LAX airport took about 40 minutes give or take and the property is right off of a very busy strip. You can even see the Hollywood sign which is close by. The Griffith Observatory is only a 5 minute drive  away, it is free  and I would highly recommend a visit if you have time to kill. Just be prepared to spend some time in traffic as this is a popular  tourist attraction.  In walking distance is a McDonalds and a Del Taco which are both open 24 hours. The hosts leave a great guide with local restaurants,  bars and things to do. Yelp is always a lifesaver for me as well for food and entertainment. <br/><br/>There is street parking on a  residential street and I had no problem finding a spot. My only very small inconvenience was walking around their vehicles with my luggage which could easily be remedied by them moving their car over a sliver. <br/><br/>These two really go above and beyond to ensure that you have a very pleasant stay and truly embody what I believe Airbnb is all about. If you get a chance to stay here, don't miss the chance. You will be very delighted.",location
"William and Elizabeth were excellent hosts. The guest house was as described, and the back yard was AMAZING. Like staying at a private luxury resort. The actual room was cozy but well appointed. The location is very walkable to Los Feliz and Silver Lake, and street parking is abundant.",location
"Very nice neighborhood, pretty house and pool. Host was friendly but gave us privacy. The bed was a little small but there is a futon, so it worked perfectly for my friend and I. They had lots of amenities, like coffee, emergency vitamin c packs, water bottles, etc. we were very comfortable there. I would definitely recommend it. ",location
"William and his wife Elizabeth have a great place to offer AirBnB travelers. They are well organized and very friendly. Due to flight delays and time spent with my daughter who lives nearby, I had informed William that I would be late. They made arrangements  and sent me instructions on how I could get in at any time I liked. I ended up checking in a little past midnight! Had no problems at all. ",clean
William and Elizabeth were great hosts. Both were very helpful. The place is nice and private and within walking distance to the Red line Metro. They left lots of little extras in the room which was nice.,location
William and Elizabeth were very pleasant. They provide you with everything you need and more! They gave great recommendations; made our first time in LA a wonderful experience.,location
"My stay was short and sweet as I was coming through town to pick up family at LAX. I slept quite well in this cozy oasis and was treated attentively by the hosts. The location was ideal for walking with many dining options and a vintage cinema in the ""hood"". A short drive was Griffith Park and a must do while in LA. I would stay here again!",location
"We had a great 2-night stay here. Coming from a New York winter, it was a delight to get to splash around in the pool when we arrived and use the spa before going to bed at night. The separate guest house made us feel less intrusive, and we appreciated the snacks and recommendations for area restaurants and bars to check out. Would definitely recommend this. ",clean
We had a great time the yard was beautiful. ,location
"I had a fantastic two nights at the Cottage. If you're a solo traveler or a couple, the space is perfect. The space was nicely outfitted with a coffee maker, minifridge, and an assortment of snacks and drinks. Realy nice touch. Also, don't miss out on spending time in the enormous backyard with heated pool and jacuzzi! <br/><br/>If this doesn't make it clear, William and Elizabeth were wonderful hosts. On top of their great space, they were super friendly and were legitimately interested in suggestions for how to improve the guest experience. Would happily stay again!",location
"I like big cities and I also love peace, quiet and nature. So Kate's place was perfect. A one of a kind, super comfortable getaway in the middle of Los Angeles' coolest neighborhood. ",location
Kate provided great communication during and after booking the house. She was able to answer any questions I had and made checking in and out a breeze. The house itself is awesome! Great location with all of the right access needed for food and culture in East LA or downtown. Highly recommended!,location
This was a perfect getaway but close enough to the office in DTLA for an easy commute. Kate was very responsive and accommodating with my shifting schedule for an extended stay. Great find!,location
Kate was very accommodating with my changing schedule and was able to adjust my extension to stay at her place longer.,location
"It was a pleasure staying at Kate's home for our week in Los Angeles.  The house is tucked away on a cul-de-sac just steps away from incredible views and hiking at Elysian Park.  There's a wonderful rustic charm to the home, making it a perfect getaway for two.  Communication with Kate was topnotch.  The home was clean, comfortable and accurately pictured.  Highly recommended.",location
"Kate made the check in very easy, and let us check out late which was helpful.  Easy parking right in front. The place had a great vibe, a mixture of the modern (nest thermostat, electric door lock, big flat screen tv) and 70s style appliances (I loved the old mechanical stove). If you like everything super modern - granite countertops and stainless steel appliances - this place is not for you. But we really liked the feeling and also liked the neighborhood a lot. Far from the west side but easy to get to Hollywood, Silver Lake and Highland park, which is where we were hanging out. The main bed was a temperpedic and was super comfortable. The 2nd ""bed"" was really just a couch and ok for a small kid or two, but barely fit one adult. Other than that, everything was great. ",location
Kate's place is a great place to stay in Los Angeles and I would recommend it to anyone traveling through the area.,location
"We know Echo Park and love it for the park, contemporary culture, and easy access to LA lifestyle. Kate's film curated space was fun and a unique experience. It was a comfortable space for the 2 of us. I loved taking a bath in the claw foot tub after a day at the beach.",location
"Place was just as described. Lovely, sunny, airy bungalow with beautiful walking trails around the corner. Kate was super responsive to every request. Quiet, private getaway in great neighborhood. ",location
Kate's place was a dream come true. An amazing 1 bedroom bungalow that meets expectations to the fullest. I will surely return soon!<br/>,location
"Kate's place is well described. I would stay here again. It's in a quiet area. Awaken to birds singing - obviously happy here too. I needed a place to stay and to work - marketing and writing. Kate's was great for both. And, in my opinion, Echo Park is a gorgeous and friendly neighborhood.",location
Great host!,host
"Kate was wonderful as a host and always available. Although I did have a problem with the space. It's a lot more rustic than it looks in pictures. It's priced like a lot of other high end places in the city; this is not up to those standards. I'm all for hipster-chic but this is a little old cabin with a few cool decorations but not a lot of light and not great furnishings. The location is quite far from the walkable parts of the neighborhoood. It's spacious, it uses an electronic lock which is great for not having to carry a key and the wifi works perfectly. However on the whole, for the price, the place has a lot of uncomfortable details. Spotty hot water in the shower; a few cobwebs on the ceilings; old stove and no other appliances; unusable patio furniture; and the location is not convenient to anything. I would not stay there again.",location
"Kate's place is AMAZING! It's beautiful and creative, and in a great location. We stayed three nights, and it was such a wonderful place to return to after days of exploring. And it would have been great to simply stay in!  Additionally, Kate was made everything very easy. She was always available and incredibly responsive. I would happily stay there again, and have already recommended it to friends!",location
"V cool, characterful house with a great LA vibe on a hilltop in Echo Park; we stayed there with our teenage son. Neighborhood interesting & accessible to most of the city; not for those who love all mod cons but very comfortable and just right for us",location
Kate's place is in a great location and is super charming.,location
Always great staying here! And this time I found a decent hike that starts a 5 minute walk from the front door.,location
"Kate is a great, kind, and attentive host! This home has a lot of charm and is in a quiet part of Echo Park for a peaceful, relaxing stay.",location
What a hidden gem! William's house is so gorgeous. My husband and I loved our stay and it was a perfect little cottage for our romantic getaway. The beautiful pool area made us feel like we were at a luxury resort. The room was clean and had many nice little surprises and treats and was stocked with everything we would need for our stay. Everything was seamless and we were given a great tip on using local transportation that saved us a lot of money and time. Anytime I am headed to LA I will plan to stay here if it is available! Thank you so much for making my birthday getaway extra special William!,location
"Highly recommended! Great neighborhood, very accommodating, beautiful property, and the price was right! And most importantly, three solid nights' sleep!",location
"The host definitely made us feel welcome, especially by heating the pool just for us and for coming and checking on the hot tub for us as well. The neighborhood was interesting--the house definitely being nicer than the neighborhood itself. However, there are lots of great eateries located very close to the location. The privacy and comfort of the property definitely offsets anything about the neighborhood.",location

William was quick to reply to any queries and also left a list of his recommendations in the room which was a nice touch. The area itself had many dining/coffee/bar options and it was only a short drive to Hollywood, Sunset strip, Melrose Ave etc. Will definitely stay here again on our next visit to LA.",location

"William and Elizabeth's direction into the property was clear.  The property itself was beautiful and as described.  William and Elizabeth gave us plenty of privacy. Although we barely saw them, they were easily contactable.  Elizabeth was sweet, she personally dropped off a hair dryer to me as the property didn't have one. Would recommend this property to anyone who loves to relax and have a resort style feel in the heart of Los Angeles. ",location

We really enjoyed our stay. Room and bathroom were clean. Bed was a bit small for two people. Lovely garden and pool. Enough parking space on the street. ,clean
"I am so glad they started an airbnb, their place is fabulous!  We enjoyed our time at William and Elizabeth""s oasis.  We had 8 days to settle in and get really comfortable with their accommodations, they thought of everything to have for any kind of guest they would possibly have and I liked how William checked in on us by cell message to see how we were doing, I appreciated that since we were running around to see all we could see but could still stay in touch.  Thank you for all your hospitality.  Cheryl and Jared",location
Just like all the other great reviews! Loved the area we stayed in as well as the location!,location

William and Elizabeth were great hosts - they were very welcoming and helpful.

The pool was lovely, and everything was clean. Parking is available on the street but can be difficult if you're out until late. The hosts were rarely seen but very nice via text. If you're an animal lover, their cat is pretty friendly, too! I would recommend staying here if you're interested in the Hollywood experience.",clean
"Totally fabulous. I could not think of a better, more relaxing place to stay.  It's on a beautiful, quiet road and easy to walk to Silverlake and Los Feliz. A wonderful start to our trip.",location
"My girlfriend and I had a great stay here! William & Elizabeth were very responsive and welcoming in their communication. The cottage had everything as promised and was very clean. The backyard/pool area is incredible. The neighborhood is fantastic, too, with tons of great stores, restaurants, and cafes in easy walking distance. We will definitely look to stay here again for future trips to LA.",clean

We found our stay to be very comforting and would absolutely plan to stay there again in the future when we visit again.  Absolutely enjoyed our conversation with your Father and the orange tree in the back was a plus.  Thanks again and look forward to seeing you again soon.  Almost forgot to mention, the rental price was well worth the amount we paid.     ",location

Kate's place is great. It's a very cool place on a quiet street in Echo Park. It's cool because you feel secluded from the city but still pretty close to most things.

Kateâs place was just perfect for my family visit to Echo Park. Having a whole bungalow to myself was so nice and itâs in a great location - very private surrounded by trees and birds. I love this part of Echo Park because itâs so central with great shopping for food and wine and juice very close by. The little food market cookbook makes shopping  in LA sooo nice and Lassenâs/ Valerieâs etc all super-close as well. The WiFi here works great making the house a great place to work which I was doing for much of the trip. Kate and Cole are awesome communicators and super flexible â my favorite kind of people. Will def be back!,location
Kateâs place is more rustic than it looks on the pictures. The cleaning done before my arrival was minimal. I noticed dust and spider webs here and there which I reported to Kate. The cleaners that she sent were never able to remove the spider webs in the bathroom. If you are allergic to dust like me itâs definitely not the best place to stat. Otherwise Kate place is very quiet and well located in a very cool area with plenty of places to go out at night (not within walking distance though). Kate was nice and very responsive to my messages.,clean
"I couldn't recommend Kate's place highly enough, we love it here. Thanks for having us back :)",location
Great Space.  Nice design.  Close to both the legal/business/financial centers of downtown LA.  Also close to the studios in Hollywood.  Travel/transport in LA can be challenging.  The location minimized those challenges.,location
Great space - Great location,location
Amazing place! Enjoyed my stay here and appreciated our communication with Kate. ,location
"Oh my gosh this place is so cool. I stayed in LA for a week working on a book and this was s dream location. Echo park is a great neighborhood with cafes and shops and pretty little bungalows. Kateâs place is right next to a hill full of native plants and trees with a lovely outdoor terrace full of birdsong. The inside has so many little unique historical details. Itâs beautiful with antique style stove and oven, wood floors, tiles, old glass windows, claw foot tub, lots of character. The speaker box style is super cool and I used it to record poems. Also Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth lives in this neighborhood so you might run into her at the coffee shop! Itâs my favorite part of LA. Kateâs an awesome host.",location
"Kate's place is very lovely, had a very comfortable bed and felt quiet and secluded in the evening so we can relax in the city. She was communicative and accommodating!",location
"This is my parent's second stay at Sandra's Airbnb - and like the first time, they enjoyed themselves and felt at home. Hope to have them stay with Sandra on their next visit.",host
"Sandra's place was very cute and she responded very quickly to messages. The rooms were a bit cold, but Sandra provided space heaters which did the trick. Check in and out were very easy and location is great!",location
"It was a pity that the two day waterworks construction during my stay stayed...There were the many troubles. but, Rigo is great man !<br/>Thank you for discount.",location
Sandra was very responsive! Great place for the in-laws while they were in town. Central to everything. Thanks Sandra!,location
"Lovely space right in the center of town. Easy access to Beverly Hills, Hollywood, Downtown, Beachesâ¦ Very peaceful, Sandra made sure I was comfortable and let me be! I'll be back if the chance arises.",location
"Sandra's place was cute, clean, comfortable, safe, private, and a great value. Rigo, Sandra's father, checked us in and showed us around. He even gave us some chocolate as a welcome gift. Sandra also responded very promptly to any questions I had. My girlfriend and I felt this was the perfect choice for us. It was a great location and had all the amenities we needed for a girls weekend. It was also a bonus to have our own private parking space. We would both stay here again. Thanks Sandra & family!",location
Sandra's place is fantastic and so comfortable. It was very near grest attractions and Sandra and her family were fun and welcoming-A great experience!,location
"Sandraâs place is very cozy and clean. It locates in nice neighborhood close to many attractions (Farmers Market, Whole Food, CVC pharmacy, banks and shops). Beds and pillows are very comfortable. Sandra is always ready to help! Next time we will stay here again! Thank you very much!!!",clean
"Wonderful place and location.... close to nice shops, restaurants, Beverly Hills. Comfortable amenities. Just beware of using navigation to get there as it either wonât show the exact address or will take you to a different one.",location
"Everything was great with Sandraâs Guest house. Perfect for 2 of us, everything extremely clean and the place was very central and Sandra and Rigo were both extremely helpful. Would highly recommend!",clean
"Great people, location was close to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, a lot of amazing places close by",location
"We chose William & Elizabeth's home for the backyard and I must say it did not disappoint. It was a piece of paradise in a beautiful city. Elizabeth was kind enough to allow us use of the pool while our room was being readied and we enjoyed every minute in the water. <br/>It's a quiet location, the home cats are beautiful and keep to themselves and Elizabeth made herself available for any questions or concerns we had. You will love staying here, as we did, and I'm sure we will be back again.",location
"The cottage and courtyard was just as described... very cute, clean and quaint. We only stayed for one night but there were many suggestions of where to eat/visit while we were there. We would definitely stay here again!  Thank you!",clean
"We've had a wonderful time in the appartment of William and Elizabeth: great location, great appartment, great garden. The photos are very accurate. We didn't have any personal contact with the owners, but everything was well-arranged, from the information to the coffee.",location
The place was very nice. Hosts were generous. Allowing pool usage and offering to play music if you wanted. They leave a few basic snacks and even beverages in a mini fridge in the room. It was great.,clean
"Perfect place, Elizbeth and William are the best hosts! We had a great time here, the location is good, the place is amazing, itÂ´s clean and nice. Also, there is a lot of info in the guesthouse - from restaurant recommendations to things to see in LA. So happy we stayed here, thank you for having us",clean
"Kate's place is in a cool location: It's a quiet street that feels very private, while still being close to the shops/restaurants/bars of Echo Park. It's a 10-minute walk to the closest coffee shop and about 25-30 minutes into central Echo Park and about a 5-minute ride via car.  It's very walkable, albeit steep. The lovely decor is as pictured, but just know it's pretty rustic. Some areas of the home could use a deep clean, but the bedroom was very tidy and the sheets and bed very comfortable. I enjoyed sitting outside (the view from the side deck is great and there are a ton of birds outside!) and it feels very safe and cozy. The internet was fast and the Bose speaker was wonderful! I had a busy work schedule while I was in town, and don't know if I would stay here for another work trip -- I think I'd prefer something that's a little closer to coffee shops/restaurants. But, it seems like it'd be great for a rustic weekend getaway, and great for a couple's trip!",location
"A little rustic but quiet and relaxing, a lot of vintage character. Kate is responsive, kind and helpful.",location
Eccentric with a flare. Also has an interesting view past the trees at night.,location
Great little spot in awesome location. Perfect !,location
My favorite part was enjoying the outdoor space - what a beautiful view!,location

This was a great experience for me. It was the first time I used airbnb. Cottage is as beautiful as the pictures show! It's a very walkable location & suited our needs perfectly. We spent most of the day out doing things and were really excited to come back and relax by the pool & beautiful outdoor areas. Elizabeth & William really have made their beautiful cottage wonderfully comfortable! They also have gorgeous cats. I would stay here again. ,location
"We were going on a longer vacation to Los Angeles and we couldn't have chosen a better place to stay! Yes the pool and outside seating is a treat on its own, the hospitality that William and Elizabeth give is more than you could ever imagine! <br/>They are quick to respond to any concerns or questions you may have, and they suggest wonderful places to eat! They have been a generous host, and will help greatly with anything that may arise! <br/>They have three cats, friendliest as can be, and they will come up to you once they get used to you. Such beautiful cats!<br/><br/>I cannot thank the two of them enough for letting us stay with them on our vacation! You will not go wrong staying here!",host
As described. The location is great and close to lots of restaurants and shopping centers. Parking is available.,location
Itâs a nice house and the location is also good.,location
I loved staying there I would book again.,location
"Close to all kinds of great LA spots , walked to Starbucks very morning !!!",location
Cute little place. Secure. Walking distance to many amenities,location
"Location was great. Sandra was very nice in communication. The rooms are located behind the house. We had trouble closing the doors and gates so they were pretty much unlocked during our duration. Bathroom floor had some hair, so the maid didnât clean it very well. Comfy beds though!",location
Great place that is centrally located. Easy to get to and the accessibility of places nearby made it terrific.,location
Sandraâs place worked out well for our stay.,clean
"Sandraâs place was clean and comfortable, just as I expected from the pictures, plus great location! She responded quickly to all my questions, and also her parents who are living in the front house were very friendly. I would recommend this place! ",clean
nice place & great location!,location
"My wife and I and our 1 year old had a great stay here. Comfortable bed, and good location. And the parking spot is a lot better than having to deal with street parking. ",location
"Great place. It was easy to find and very close to everything. Multiple supermarkets nearby, gas stations within a few blocks, there's even a laundry place a few minutes away. Very nice neighborhood. The place is really nice and clean. Everything is provided for just like a hotel. ",clean
another great stay. Many thanks!,clean
"Great location near West Hollywood/Beverly Hills; attractive, spacious and well appointed accommodation; and a very helpful host.  I can't recommend Sandra's place highly enough.",location
"Our stay was great. Elizabeth and William were exemplary hosts. Communication was always quick and clear. Place was clean, location was hard to beat. I would definitely consider staying here again should I return to LA.",clean
"Loved everything about our stay here! William and Elizabeth were very easy to communicate with. They sent us all the necessary information straight away and responded quickly to any questions we had. The property itself is just as amazing as the photos! We spent our day outside by the pool, we walked to dinner at Sunset Junction, and the room and bathroom were clean and comfortable. ",clean
"The property was just as pictured, very beautiful. We enjoyed our stay very much.  The location was great and the hosts were very accommodating. ",location

Lovely place! Highly recommend for a quiet retreat in the middle of Los Angeles <3,location
"Kate's place is a beautiful retreat in the hills of Echo Park area. It has a very private feel, tucked away but still very walkable. I walked to the cafes on Sunset Boulevard everyday (about 20 minute walk) after running on the trail near the house. There's a great bathtub at Kate's place, the shower is excellent, and the bed is extremely comfy and clean. The whole place is very clean (something really important to me as a traveler) and it's well-kept and there is plenty of parking on the street. Would definitely stay again.",clean
Enjoyed perfect privacy in this well furnished bungalow just minutes away from crazy busy areas,location
Kateâs place was super inviting. The outside area is beautiful and perfect for an outside meal. The bed is a freakinâ cloud! And the whole home just feels comforting:) I loved it,location
"Beautiful, creative, and cozy. Feels like being in the middle of nature with all the best parts of echo park a short drive away.",location
"Kate and Cole were thoughtful hosts, great communicators, and kind humans. The house is lovely, great energy, and really comfortable, with all the bases covered for kitchen supplies. The outdoor space and amazing bathtub were my favorites.",location
WARNING: this host is a scammer and will do anything she can to get money out of you. I had a dinner party with five guests that she confirmed I could have and she accused me of breaking her floor ha. I went above and beyond to clean what was considered having a normal small dinner (after paying a cleaning fee) and even had everyone take their shoes off and she still made a massive fuss. Also youâre not allowed to smoke on the property outside. The house reeks of some sort of grime or urine.  Overall I had a horrible triggering experience after paying big bucks where she tried to extort me for $200.00 and blame some missing grout which would cost $15 to fix on me. DO NOT STAY HERE.,clean
"Great spot, quiet neighborhood right next to the park, and the best bathroom.",location
"Kateâs home is tucked away in a wonderful location! If you are looking for a more secluded, nature retreat from the busy city life this is a great spot. It has, âcabin in the woodsâ vibes mixed with a touch of, âold Hollywoodâ.",location
"This is a special space maintained by a special host. Centrally located, well-appointed and cozy. Iâd stay again in a heartbeat.",location
"Kateâs place is great. Very eclectic and rustic cabin feel yet just a very short drive to everything LA has to offer. Definitely recommend staying, but be prepared to show a photo of your ID prior to check in.",location
"I really enjoyed my stay here. Comfortable bed, nice kitchen, nice sturdy table to work on and a great TV. I also appreciated the nature surrounding the house. I will stay here again for sure.",location
"Karen was very hospitable, and the apartment was comfortable and well-appointed. We had a great weekend. Thanks!",clean
"The place was absolutely lovely, just as described if not even better in person.  The location couldn't have been better, in a great part of the neighborhood with plenty of street parking and great bars & restaurants within walking distance.  Elizabeth was very friendly and welcoming- it was very easy to feel at home here, and I would love to stay again!",location
"Amazing! The house is exactly the same with the pictures, and quiet. What's more? They offer snacks and many fast drinks! The cats are elegant. They don't eat bread ( sry I did try feed them :P ) Oh, the pool and the whole back yard is just fantastic. The water is clean and the grass is green. Parking is not a problem. However, the most thing I like the the shower room. The shower stream is powerful, big and comfortable, with a lot of shower shampoo to choose.Very pleasant experience.",clean
"The cottage was as described, cozy beautiful and well organized. The bed is really confortable even if it's a tiny bit noisy. We really enjoyed our stay and also enjoyed the pool and jaccuzzi at night. Elizabeth and William printed a list of restaurant/bar recommendations that was really useful. Do not hesitate to go to the Indian's restaurant (best have ever had and the Tiki Ti Bar) I highly recommend this place if you stop by LA. Also great location especially if you want to visit Warner Bros Studio, Universal and also Hollywood boulevard. Thanks for everything!!",location
"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful experience at the Los Feliz Oasis Cottage!  The hosts were very gracious to take our reservation with under 24 hour notice and extremely informative and helpful with all the steps.  The property is *GORGEOUS* and the perfect location to have a fun night out in Los Feliz/Silverlake/Echo Park (as NYCers we actually walked to our restaurant for dinner but driving/parking in the area is also super convenient).  It is definitely an oasis with a pool, hot tub and beautiful landscaping!  We would love to stay again - highly recommended!",location
We had a lovely stay in this adorable pool cottage! We adored the outside area and the pool and loved being able to walk to a lot of our favourite LA spots. We met Elizabeth and she was very welcoming. The cats are also lovely! Highly recommend staying here. ,location
"Had a wonderful stay at this lovely property. Elizabeth was extremely responsive and helpful. Room had everything needed, including small frig, keurig, pool towels and sunscreen. It was wonderful relaxing in the beautiful yard and pool with waterfalls.  Very walkable area of LA with lots of good restaurants, coffee, and shops nearby. Hope to return soon!",location
"Had a very perfect stay here, Hosts were very welcoming. The pool and hot tub was also beautiful. Would definitely visit L.A again and definitely would stay here. ",location

This place is great - the pool is a big plus after a day in the sun. I recommend staying here. ,location

"Listing was exactly as pictured. Pool was lovely for afternoon and evening relaxation.  Instructions for access were clear and easy. Elizabeth made us feel very welcome.  Pleasant, easy walk to nearby restaurants (we walked to India's restaurant, Jay's bar, Vita coffee) and to subway.  We also enjoyed exploring the surrounding neighborhood.  ",location
"Lovely place, very friendly, close to lots. Great amenities, wish we stayed for more then one night. Highly recommend!",location

"Really amazing listing in LA, definitely allowed us to experience Los Angeles and have fun. Amazing backyard, amazing space plus it's in a great little neighborhood with lots of stuff to do.",location
"We highly recommended this place. It is a very nice cottage and warm welcome from the host, we felt like home staying at this cottage. It has all you needed and much more of a kind recommendation of nearby neighborhoods and sightsee spot, and ofcoz food as well.<br/><br/>",location
This was our first AirBnB stay and it left an impression. The place was beautiful and our hosts were very accommodating. The stay couldn't have been nicer. The room was well stocked with amenities that we would never even expect from a nice hotel. Looking forward to staying here during out next visit to LA. ,clean
"We only met Elizabeth on arrival but communication via email was quick and efficient. The garden setting was beautiful although we didn't use the pool or outside space. We found the cottage a little small.  However,  great location and good recommendations for local eating.",location
William and Elizabeth were so helpful! Very fast at answering questions I had! The pool and hot tub are so nice! Great place to relax!,location
Even better than in the pictures and as described! Very kind and helpful approach from Elizabeth. She helped out with small things and gave us folders with recomendations. I can highly recommend a stay at Los Feliz Cottage Pool.<br/><br/>,clean
Our stay at William and Elizabeth's cottage was perfect. The location is walking distance from great places like the Tiki Ti and Chavo restaurant. The cottage was filled with goodies and very cozy. I recommend to stay here for anyone interested in knowing the truly hip part of LA. ,location
Everything was according to the description.<br/><br/>,clean
"Listing was accurate. Cottage was in great location, was small but cozy.  Lovely courtyard and nice pool/spa. Elizabeth was a great host and helped make us feel comfortable. Snacks and coffee were welcome addition.",location
"We had a wonderful stay here!  The courtyard and pool were a beautiful oasis and the cottage was quaint and very organized.  Elizabeth had everything labeled for us, and easily accessible.  She also had some great snacks and a coffee machine for us to use.  The area is in a really cool part of L.A. with a great coffee shop just around the corner.  We really liked the neighborhood and the quietness of the place.  We found a super cool place to go salsa dancing that was something out if a movie!  You had to walk through an armior like in the book ""The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe"" to enter.  If you stay here you must check it (Website hidden by Airbnb) called La Descarga.  Anyhow, we had a terrific experience and would definitely recommend it.  One issue was that we got a $73 parking ticket because apparently you can't park on the street on Friday mornings from 8-10am.  If you could warn peoe about that I think that would be good.  We didn't see any signs on the side of the road we parked on, but the next morning found the the ticket and then at the end of the road saw a sign but couldn't see that in the dark.  Everything else was great!  Thank you!",location
Their place was amazing. The pool and jacuzzi were so much fun. Everything about the place was very thoughtful.,clean
"Awesome experience! The place is nice and cozy, a little small for 3 people, but it is still good. The hosts responded very quickly to our messages, they did their best to accommodate our needs and left us drinks and snacks. All in all, I would recommend this place to anyone visiting LA.",clean
"A cozy, beautifully accommodating spot nestled in one of my favorite Los Angeles neighborhoods. Very affordable, especially given the fact it has a kick ass pool and fantastic jacuzzi!<br/><br/>Amenities were well stocked and laid out, bed was cozy, and they weren't overbearing (yet I felt like I could reach then at a moments notice!).",location
"William and Elizabeth were excellent hosts. The accommodations, logistics, and more were on point. Thank you!",clean
"William and Elizabeth's place was just as described, and the multi-leveled backyard with pool, jacuzzi, and fireplace was even better! Elizabeth communicated promptly and responded to all our messages in minutes. We came late and left very early for a flight, and she was completely flex about check in and out. The space is compact, but laid out perfectly with great instructions. We spent much more time in the yard than in the room, which was great. Hot tubbing by moonlight with the stars and lights from the hills twinkling was a  great memory. The location is great to walk to shops, bars and restaurants, and close to many other LA destinations. We would totally come back!",location
Great place in a great neighborhood.  Nice amenities and nice hosts.  Thank you.,location
"William and Elizabeth's cottage was adorable and their property is absolutely beautiful!  Elizabeth was extremely helpful when planning our stay, and also very flexible, which was great since when I booked the reservation I was unsure if we were a party of 2 or 3.  The cottage had everything we needed, and then some: wifi, bottles of water, a Keurig coffee machine, and Kind bars.  The location was perfect too, with plenty of street parking, but also the ability to walk to many bars and restaurants.  Elizabeth was also generous enough to let us enjoy the property after we checked out while we were waiting for our ride.  The cottage and property were exactly as described, though the room was a bit small for 3 people.  It is definitely doable to have a third guest in the cottage, but space was tight.  I would absolutely stay here again, and recommend it for a party of two.",location
Our stay with William and Elizabeth was wonderful. Our room was very nicely set up and the amenities on the property were lovely. It was also quiet which was nice and close to restaurants and coffee shops. My boyfriend and I played basketball in the pool and enjoyed the hot tub every day. Elizabeth was a wonderful host and we would stay here again. ,location
"We loved this BnB! The grounds are beautiful! The neighborhood is fantastic too! Walking distance from all kinds of fun stuff. The owners are friendly! The bed was old, but super comfortable. Theres a futon if you have more then 2 people. There's a great fountain & tons of outdoor room to hang out. Plus, they let us check out late since we were extra sleepy from being out late. Everything was awesome! Loved it! We will be back for sure! Thanks to William & Elizabeth",location
"Great experience. The room was clean and had everything you need, even with some snacks left out :) And best of all, the hot tub was amazing, set in a very relaxing backyard courtyard with a pretty view around it.  Very relaxing and fun stay.",location
Such a great find in Los Feliz! Adorable little guest house with beautiful pool and patio. Elizabeth and William were very accommodating and friendly. I couldn't believe how nice it was for the price. Would definitely stay again! ,location
"A lovely place. The hosts gave me complete privacy while also being totally available if I needed anything. Sweet little cottage and inviting pool. A great neighborhood, very safe, while near all the cool stuff in Los Feliz and Hollywood. Oh, and excellent wifi! Also, an extremely generous and thoughtful array of snacks, coffee, tea, and even Perrier. I'll definitely be back. ",location
"Our first Airbnb experience could not have gone any smoother!  Although we did not get the chance to meet the homeowners, all the information was provided in detail and the outdoor area/pool/jacuzzi was simply amazing! After notifying Elizabeth of our late ETA, the hosts ensured we arrived to a warm swimming pool and pre-heated hot tub to welcome us after a long flight.  I'm not sure if it was due to the holidays, but we did not encounter a single soul on this paradise of a property, which made it a very peaceful and relaxing experience.<br/><br/>Great location, no trouble finding parking in a seemingly safe neighborhood. The coffee/tea bar in the room was an added bonus. The only negative for our trip was the cold weather. Be careful at night on the deck walking between the pool and hot tub. Also, the fence/gate is a little high for shorter people to access and the lock sometimes did not shut completely so please make sure its closed securely. All in all, I am glad I have to look no further the next time I travel to LA and want to stay in a beautiful Oasis near to Hollywood. Highly recommended to anybody considering a stay with William and Elizabeth!",clean
"We absolutely loved this place... The parking was not hard, check-in was smooth, and the location is convenient yet quiet. It was cold and rainy, but the room gave us warmth. It's not big, but clean, tidy, bright, romantic, and had all things we needed. We especially appreciate the air-con, the in-the-room washer/dryer, and the Keurig machine. Elizabeth was responsive to my messages even she was away. We never knew but this was definitely the highlight of our trip.",clean
Walkable to tons of great restaurants and bars in Los Feliz/Silverlake. The hosts provided wonderful recommendations that we really appreciated. The full size bed was comfortable and the room was clean. The backyard is a wonderful place to relax and we really enjoyed the hot tub during our stay in December. Access to the cottage can be tricky if you arrive at night and if a car is parked in the driveway - but once you learn the system it is fine. We would recommend this location to our friends. ,location
William and Elizabeth's place was great! Plenty of street parking and was an easy location to get to. Elizabeth was helpful and was available immediately by text when I had questions. The cottage itself was nice and quiet inside. The washer and dryer were conveniently located inside. We were able to try out the jacuzzi which was amazing! Definitely recommend staying here if you want to relax and unwind. ,location
"Not as great as the pictures show it.   Huge one bedroom duplex shared solitude owners.   Not real quiet from street noise, but it is very private.   If you do not have a bad back, then the furniture may be comfortable for you.   WiFi does not extend to bedroom where there is no TV.   Owners are lovely people, but the unit is a bit dirty/dusty.   It served its purpose, but I would not go back.    Simply because, there was no comfortable furniture that supported my back and my boyfriendâs back.   Good luck!",location
"Nice clean spot, centrally located.. Easy check in. Overall solid place.",clean
"I just finished an extended stay (2 weeks) and really enjoyed staying here. I didn't know this area well prior to staying but now I love it. It is a back unit of a duplex type house. The street seems to be lined with multi unit homes that, like this one, are well cared for and you can't really tell there is a second address around back (I ordered several things while there that Fed Ex was able to deliver).  This is hidden well behind the huge side gate in the pics, which I liked.  The street is busy (cars) but you can get in and out of the driveway.  There is not a ton of foot traffic and I felt very comfortable and safe (even on Halloween :-). I enjoyed the occasional sounds of a family living in the front of the house.  Its quiet and you don't hear much but just enough to know they are there, which is comforting. <br/>The area is quite busy and close to everything. Really an excellent location.  $3-5 Lyft to all the popular shopping on Fairfax, Melrose, the Grove and Beverly Center. Starbucks and gas station 1 block away. Grocery store, laundromat and post office all less than a mile. Literally ever time I (Hidden by Airbnb) d ""_____ near me""... what  I was looking for was within a mile. You wouldn't need a car really, I had one half my visit, but with Lyft and the scooters for rent all around the sidewalks its almost easier not to.  About 30 min to Venice Beach or LAX and just outside of Beverly Hills. This home and the city are very friendly. Had a great visit, thanks for sharing your space.",location
This beautiful and comfortable place was more than what I asked for. The location is walking distance to tons of great spots for food and for some night life. The neighborhood is big and quiet and there were some great views of LA to be seen right around the corner. The apartment was spacious and bright ! She also left some good amenities for us to use and some delicious coffee. She was an excellent host and very accommodating! Would stay here again for sure.,location
"Perfect for a family. Karen was a very helpful host and I am so glad we stayed at her place. There were enough toys and movies provided by Karen to entertain my young daughter. Between Karen's helpfulness, central location and uber there was no need to rent a car. I will recommend and use again.",host

Just a few turns, and you find yourself in the heart of LA before you know it! I had the pleasure of meeting Elizabeth. She was very nice and welcoming. Left me with some sound advice & recommendations on where to go for the best food & city sights. Beautiful patio, very festive! Had zero problems/issues. ",location
Attentive and reliable host. Beautiful back yard. I really enjoyed the hot tub. The outdoor area in this property truly resembles a spa experience,location
This was a great stay at a centrally-located property with a KILLER backyard.  It saved me $$$ not having to rent a hotel room.  My hosts were easy to communicate with and overall it was a nice stay.  The bed was super comfy and holy water pressure Batman!,location
"We so enjoyed our time at the Oasis cottage we would definitely come back! Elizabeth was thoughtful, prepared, kind, and careful to allow us our privacy. Although there were other guests in the cottage across the courtyard during our stay, we barely noticed them.  We were a little concerned that the space might be small for 2 adults and a small child. It was but having the gorgeous outdoor space really helped. We were able to use that space as both dining room and relaxing space. The only thing we missed was having a microwave for leftovers. The hot tub and pool were so lovely. The cottage is close to some fun tourist spots like Griffith Park and a grocery store and great coffee shop are right around the corner. We fully enjoyed ourselves!",location
"Elizabeth has thought of everything ! it's so well appointed and she even turned on the hot water in the pool for my crazy winter dip..Wish I'd stayed longer, this is great value in a calm and great location. When on that side of LA I'll try to rebook!",location

The place looks a lot better in person that on the pictures. She even provides toiletries, coffee and tea. It was such a pleasure staying at her place, I will definitely be coming back next time I'm around. Karen's place was great, perfect location, everything was clean and functional. ",clean
Karen's place is in a great location and has all the amenities we needed for a great vacation. Karen was so accommodating and let my husband and I check in early after our early morning flight. It was also wonderful having a parking space and not having to worry about finding a spot to park after a long day out and about. Great views of the city at night and quiet away from the hustle and bustle of sunset boulevard. Would recommend this to anyone visiting the Hollywood area. Easy access to both city and beach! ,location

Bed and lounge area were very comfy and we had everything we needed. The place was very quiet at night, but each morning we were woken up early by either workmen or gardeners with their blowervacs. If you are over 6ft you may have a problem with the height of the shower but we had no issues. Karen was always just a text away with any questions we had, she was lovely.

The hosts are hands down perfect in making sure we had the best experience in our mini-vacation. If we come back to LA, we'll definitely book at their place again. <br/><br/>They were also very responsive to our messages whenever we needed anything or had any concerns. The house manual and recommendations in their info was simple and concise.<br/><br/>We felt as if we were in paradise.

"I think that William & Elizabeth have chosen just the right name because an oasis it is. We took photos of ourselves in the outdoor areas and posted them to our friends - our photos looked like postcard shots and our friends wanted to know which resort we were staying at!<br/><br/>The location is close to the central business district with amenities such as supermarkets, restaurants, coffee shops etc, all close by.<br/>Elizabeth was very attentive & helpful - even when we tried barbecue oysters on the open fireplace.<br/><br/>",location
"I could not have asked for a more perfect first Air BnB experience. The property was gorgeous and situated in a hip, walkable area. We completely fell in love with the space and neighborhood.  Our room was essentially a cozy pool house, adjacent to a lush outdoor patio space with a pool and hot tub that we utilized each night of our stay. After a long day of hiking around Joshua tree or exploring the city, it was a lovely way to relax. Great coffee shops, movie theaters and bars are all just blocks away. Los Feliz is such a cool part of town and by the end of the trip, we all wanted to move in and stay forever. Our room was prepped with water bottles, coffee, pool towels and other little touches and amenities that were appreciated. We also really enjoyed the flexible check in time and ease of access. Our trip was packed with fun, and we didnât actually meet Elizabeth during our stay but she was quick to respond and kind with every message. Itâs clear that these people know what theyâre doing! I seriously canât say enough good things about this listing and the for the price- it absolutely cannot be beat. <br/>",location

Clean comfortable and allows easy access w parking. Back apartment of duplex.,clean
"Great location for the guest house.  We rented a car so it was about half an hour vicinity to Santa Monica, downtown, Beverly Hills, Griffith observatory and Universal Studios! 40 minutes to LAX during rush hour. Convenient parking space and a very private entrance located behind a gate.  Would recommend to any travellers who aren't sure what they want to see in LA but want a location that's central to everything.",location
Sandra and her parents are very accommodating. Great location!,location
"The convenience of this home is great. It was perfectly situated to everything we wanted to do in Los Angeles. There is a lot of room throughout for storage. There is one space to park and a private, lighted entrance. The king-sized bed is comfortable. <br/><br/>However, there were a few things that are not-so-great. The place, overall, had a musty smell. The bed pillows are flat and uncomfortable. There isn't a sofa, so the only place to sit in the living room is a chair. There is a daybed, but that is not a comfortable place to sit and watch TV. There is a Roku TV, not a live one. Getting into the tub is a bit tricky due to a very high tiled wall. Drawers were sticky to open, and lined with dirty liners.",clean
"Sandraâs place is an old, but charming, cozy and comfortable space. Having lived in a 100-year old house for 20 years it felt familiar to us. We especially appreciated some small touches: coffee, bottled water, extra blankets and space heaters (LA was unusually cold for March), and access to Netflix and Amazon Prime. The location is very convenient: wonderful food in nearby Little Ethiopia!",location
"Sandra's place was great for our visit.  The kitchen had most everything you could need to make a meal, which exceeded my expectations. Would def stay again!",clean
I have stayed here numerous times and love it. Sandraâs place is cozy and just a walk away from my training events bypassing all the traffic! <br/><br/>I love the big back yard and can sit outside on the table and relax.<br/><br/>She always improves something each time I stay. This time it was a new shower and the mini oven deal Iâve never seen anywhere that thing cranks.,location
"Sandra's apartment was a delight and near several major avenues (San Vicente, Wilshire, Olympic, AND Fairfax), so it couldn't be more centrally located. It's a duplex layout with her parents occupying the front of the residence but you very much have your own entrance and own parking spot. There's a lovely vintage feel to it and you can't beat the price--at least I couldn't!",location
Sandra was a great host with a wonderful guesthouse close to LACMA and downtown! It is quiet and charming with the brightly colored walls. It was the perfect spot to come back to after a long day looking at art galleries and gardens. Netflix works great! Kitchen is just the right size to cook small meals for breakfast with Whole Foods and Trader Joe's nearby! Sandra was quick to respond and available anytime. Easy checkin and out. Would definitely stay again!,location
Amazing stay thank you so much !!,clean
Charming casita in the heart of where you want to be when visiting Los Angeles. Just a block or two from the museums...walkable. Free off-street parking. Plenty of storage space.

"The neighborhood was lovely, and well worth visiting. Elizabeth communicated well and was helpful when we asked her to explain how the pool lights, outdoor lights, fireplace, etc. worked. The outdoor space was great. The cottage furniture is not new or in excellent shape, but it mostly serves its purpose. The mattress is very soft and sinks a bit in the middle if you have two people in the bed. The bathroom was clean. ",clean
"Elizabeth and William made sure that I had all the necessities. It was so great to have a good coffee maker and even a small fridge to store wine and cheese in to enjoy out by the pool in the evenings. <br/>I stayed in the smaller of the two cottages and even used the washer and dryer tucked away in one of the closets. <br/>The yard is beautiful, the pool and all of the surroundings very relaxing. This would be a delightful place for two or three women friends to stay for a get-away. On site Yoga is available if you make an appointment. <br/>I would certainly return. <br/>Claudia Sternbach<br/>",location
The location was perfect as we were going to universal studio and a concert at the forum. Elizabeth place was perfect as she had anything you ever needed. The best host I ever had to be honest and the pool oasis in the back was a get sight to see even though I didn't get to use it. ,location

"Karen's place is exactly as described and she's a tremendous host! Her small attached apartment is perfect for a weekend get away to the ills of Hollywood. The location is perfectly nestled in the hills right above Sunset Plaza and within walking distance to night life, restaurants and shopping.

Karen's place was great. We arrived very late and she was very accommodating when we arrived and showed us where everything and how everything worked in the apartment. She was very helpful and suggested things to do during our stay there. Her place was very clean and location was safe. Before booking we had some questions and Karen responded really quickly. ,clean
"Karen was so sweet and attentive to our needs.  She made us feel very welcome in her home and gave us complete privacy.  She was VERY responsive anytime that I had a question throughout the process and kept a very friendly and accommodating tone.  The property itself is tucked into a quiet, beautiful neighborhood but you are moments away from all of the action!  It's' an ideal location.  It's spacious with plenty of kids toys to keep them busy and the fully stocked kitchen is great.  The king bed is also very comfy.  I like that there were separate sleep areas between the bedroom and living room for privacy.",location
"Easy to get to. Quite spacious (except for an oddly shaped small shower). Nice furnishings, ample parking. Karen showed us around and then we had the place to ourselves - very private even though the apartment is the lower part of a house. Great stay!",location
"Overall, I had a great experience and would recommend both Karen and her place.  I'll list the pros and cons below:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Karen-Karen was warm and welcoming and flexible with my check in time.  I was driving in from out of state and kept having to delay my time and she was very kind about that.  <br/><br/>2) The space.  The space is large and open, there is a living room area, small bathroom, full kitchen (oven, stove, refrigerator, dish washer, coffee maker (and coffee and tea) and bedroom with a desk.<br/><br/>3) Location- This home is located in beautiful Bel Air with gorgeous homes all around as well as Sunset Boulevard nearby.<br/><br/>4) Price-The price is accurate for the space and location.  You are getting a good deal here.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1) This may or may not be a con for you.  Shared laundry and dishwasher.  Though Karen said she listed it in the ad, I didn't realize someone would be down in the space to wash clothes and/or do dishes.  This is my mistake for not noticing it, but since it said private space, I assumed I would have the entire space for the entire time.  However, Karen was respectful and only came down when I was away.  I was here for a week.  If you're here for a shorter stay she may not need to come down.<br/><br/>2) The space: This is the bottom portion of her huge home.  It is the size of a one bedroom, it seems to be the basement area or kids area.  There is some natural light that comes through in the living room area, but not in the bedroom or kitchen. (Again, maybe that doesn't matter to you).  The bathroom was small, but adequate.  If you are taller than 5'5"" you may have to duck in the shower as the ceiling is slanted.  I was fine and it didn't really bother me.  The bed was large, about a king size, but it appears to be two single beds placed together with a cushion on top of some kind.  It slants slightly toward the feet.  I slept ok on it.  If you are particular about beds, this may bother you.  If not, you'll be fine.<br/><br/>The only other minor thing is that sound really carries in her place.  The first night I could hear the TV in the next bedroom and a few times when they came home at night I could here conversations and they weren't really speaking all that loudly.  If noise bothers you, this may be an issue.  However, I was there Sunday through Friday morning and was only really bothered 3 times.  The rest of the time it was pretty quiet.<br/><br/>Again, all in all, it's a nice place to stay.  The location is perfect; safe and beautiful.  Karen is a kind and gracious host and really goes out of her way to be accommodating.  She always responded to texts right away and was warm and welcoming.",clean
Karen was very hospitable and welcoming. Check in and out was easy. Place as pictured is what it is; clean and very roomy. Excellent location as well. Would stay again!,clean

Elizabeth was very responsive and communicative in hosting us in their pool house bungalow. The pool is super nice and I'm glad they keep it heated :) The basketball hoop in the pool is always a nice touch. Big fan!  The area was super convenient for us as we were getting dinner in Korea Town and not too far from Downtown. It was a super brief trip so fast communication and flexibility was key. Elizabeth delivered on both of these. :) ,location
"Awesome experience!! Would definitely stay again. The pictures don't do it justice. The room was clean and comfortable with everything you'd need for a short or extended stay. The backyard area is gorgeous and the tranquility it provides is second to none. The homeowners are genuine and really care about your experience. They have 3 cats that occasionally roam the back yard. Being an animal lover, petting the adorable little kitty fuzz next to the fountain only added to the perfect stay. Wonderful people, wonderful experience!! 5 stars fantastic",clean
Our host had everything ready for us by the time we arrived. There was no hassle at all and turned out to be a great choice. ,clean
Elizabeth and Will did an amazing job making us feel welcome. The place is even better than the photos show. We would stay here again in a heartbeat.,clean
"Easy communication and easy to access the room. Quiet and safe residential street. Friendly cats. Made good use of the pool and hot tub in the beautiful back yard. There is a mini toaster oven that may come in handy for breakfast and a small bar fridge to keep your drinks cold. Just a reminder to all there is no kitchen for food prep. We walked to the metro station which was convenient. The fold out sofa is not comfortable for an extended stay, but OK in a pinch for a night. Thank you!<br/> ",location
"Great choice to stay with Elizabeth and William on this wonderful place (have been even two times there). It was well organized and described. Elizabeth answered every time immediately when I had questions. The room and bathroom was cute and clean. There is a coffee machine, some grain bares, refrigerator with water bottles in it, if you need even a washing machine & tumbler, iron. The pool area is so amazing and is like described. You are living in a quiet and safe residential area, all you need is in walking distance around (car rental, supermarket, metro lines, restaurants, parking spaces in front, etc). Had a really great time. Thx.",clean

Elizabeth is correct in saying that she's available 24/7 - I sent a message from the plane not realising that it was 4am in LA, to which Elizabeth responded within a few minutes. You wouldn't find better hospitality anywhere else (and sorry again for not realising the time difference!)",location
"My wife and I had a great time! We loved our quaint room and the pool and hot tub were icing on the cake! Just as pictured the pool area was like being in another world while also being right in the city. Hot tub was most enjoyable. Wonderful location. Very private - independent entry. Hosts were very helpful and communicative - quick response time. Coffee, snacks, and cold water bottles were available and the room was equipped with everything you might need including washer and dryer and ironing board. The bathroom, while small, was just fine and the shower water pressure was better than home!  Thank you for everything! ",location
Karen was an awesome host! No complaints whatsoever. The place was clean and a lot bigger than what I was expecting. The location was amazing right above sunset in the Hollywood Hills.

"Karen was extremely helpful and accommodating during my mother and I's tough time and reason for travel. She was more than willing to be flexible if needed regarding check-in time and upon arrival greeted us with understanding and a warm smile. Her home is very cozy and comfortable for at least 2 people, I believe there is an option for 2 additional beds. The home is exactly as pictured. We also appreciated how convenient the location was! It was within minutes to Sunset Blvd, if you're up for an uphill challenge- and by challenge I mean hiking up the mountainous hills of WeHo- it's doable :-). But, we were able to drive to sunset in 5 minutes and find parking on a side street easily when dining out. It was also only about 1/2 hr w/ traffic to Venice Beach where we were able to escape. LA traffic is a nightmare however Karen's place was centrally located making it easy to get around. I would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Los Angeles and looking to be near Sunset Blvd and the breathtaking, Beverly Hills neighborhood. ",location

"I traveled with my 22 year old son.  Our flight arrived very early and we drove to Karen's place to drop off our bags.  However, Karen made us feel very welcome from the outset.  She gave us some good tips on different things and eating places in the local area.  The house was clean and tidy and had everything one could need for a stay.  However, my son and I are both 6' 1"" (185 cm) tall and for us the bathroom and shower was a problem.  The bathroom is very tiny.  With the shower we had to squat because of the angled shower ceiling.  It wasn't too much of a problem but I wouldn't have like to stay for more than the 3 days we did because of it.  If you are 5' 8"" (173 cm) or under it probably won't be a problem",space

Most of the time we just stayed in just lounging around because of how comfy and cozy it was. Even after our long days of running around site seeing, it was nice to come home to our very own parking spot that is just steps from the door. l'm very pleased & happy that I chose this spot...Highly recommend itð",location
"We really enjoyed our stay at Sandra's apt. Sandra's father checked us in and explained everything always with a smile on his face! The atmosphere around the neighborhood was what we loved the most. You'll find everything near, Starbucks around the corner for breakfast, CVS and Whole Food Market 2km away - really a strategic position! The house was bigger than we expected, we definitely liked that too!",location
"Great location, great hospitality and great with answering any questions I had. Wasn't the cleanest of places, but worked for what my friend and I needed.",clean
"Sandraâs place  was everything we needed for our trip to LA. It was centrally located and within quick drives of all attractions with ample parking space. The house itself had all the amenities, AC was cool, comfy accommodations, couldnât ask for anything more. Great value!",location
It is a lovely historical place that feels like home immediately. I did not expect it to be so big! Super close to the center of everything. Great to come back to and unwind after being out and about.,location
Great location. Host answered all my questions & even accommodated my 2am check in. I loved that I could walk to so much stuff in the Miracle Mile area.. awesome visit to LA for sure & Iâd refer friends to stay here.,location
Great communication! The pictures on Airbnb is exactly what you get. A charming place located in a great part of LA!!,location
"Roomy in a good location. Communicative host. <br/>Low level of cleanliness, very unpleasant incidents involving ants in the kitchen and toilet and a cockroach on bedroom pillow.",clean
"Home was exactly as advertised. Great location, comfortable sleeping arrangements, very cozy, warm, welcoming home. Located in a great area with tons of things to do nearby and lots of great restaurants and museums. Highly recommend!",location
"Karen helped us perfectly with all our questions and problems. It was a very quiet neighborhood as a perfect place to conquer LA, Hollywood and Santa Monica. ",location
"5 Stars! This is my 4th time using Air BnB and definitely my best experience to date. Karen was an excellent host who allowed us to drop our bags off before check in. She also had a number of great recommendations for local bars and restaurants. She was also very understanding when we called her in the early hours as our friend had locked us out. The rental space itself is excellent. Had absolutely everything that is required for a stay in LA. Comfy beds, great kitchen with a wash and dryer. The aircon is great and Karen even provides additional fans. Contrary to what other reviews have said we did not encounter any ants whatsoever. As an added bonus the location is great in one of the most exclusive areas of LA. The Rolls Royce in the house across the road is testament to that. Thanks for the stay Karen. ",clean
"My fiancÃ© and I stayed at Sandraâs for 4 nights and it was perfect! Super spacious for just the two of us. The free parking space is a great amenity, and itâs very close to a CVS/Whole Foods/farmers market for any last minute travel needs. Sandra & Rigo were quick to respond and very helpful. A great place to stay if you want to be central â about a 25 min drive to the beach (on the weekend), and 30ish minutes for some other places in the city (Echo Park, Silver Lake, the observatory). Weâd definitely stay again!",location
"This property was luxurious, yet felt as cozy as a home. Everything was perfect and picturesque and we couldn't have been more satisfied. The hosts took hospitality to a new level, providing everything from towels and Keurig coffee/creamer/sugar to personally printed ideas of places and restaurants around the area. They texted us to make sure that everything was as perfect as they had hoped and there was no way to, adequately, describe how much BETTER it was than we could've hoped. I would recommend this stay time and time again! :)",clean
Elizabeth and William have created a beautiful backyard oasis. They communicated well and efficiently.   The room was as described.  It's in a great location.,location
"Our stay was perfect and just what we were looking for. Pool was quiet and truly an oasis! Neighborhood was great. Apartment itself was no frills but was clean, had everything we needed and had a comfy bed. Hosts were on site to answer any questions we had. Would recommend! ",clean
"This was the perfect get away! The host was amazing! Very communicative, generous, and kind. Kept in touch when I needed and I had absolute privacy outside of that. The property is exactly as pictured and even better than expected actually. I can't wait to have more time and be able to go back for my next break! It's a great location and close to everything, but feels as if your far away and that's the best part about it, besides the host. I'll definitely be back.  Thanks so much for a lovely much-needed stay! ",location
great place and hosts! ,location
It was awesome. The backyard is incredible and the hosts are great. ,location
"The cottage was serene and cozy. It is obvious that Elizabeth and William care about their guests. The pool area is just a fabulous as it looks and should absolutely be taken advantage of. Although we only stayed for one night, this was the perfect location to get to the Dodger game and to enjoy a delicious brunch the next morning. ",location
"My wife and I had a wonderful time staying with Will and Elizabeth!  They were very friendly and they were spot on with their recommendations of places to go.  The neighborhood has plenty of restaurants/bars to check out and we were very happy with all the places they suggested.  Our room was very clean and it was nice to have coffee or snacks available.  Plus, their cats are super adorable, but don't forget to keep an eye out for them by the gates!  On top of all of this, their place is gorgeous.  It was great to be able to either sit poolside or relax in the hot tub.  If you're staying in the Hollywood/Los Feliz area, I highly recommend staying here!",clean
"Great place to stay! Walking distance to Loz Feliz and Silverlake area with a lot of restaurants, bars, shops and cafes. Backyard is wonderful - we mostly played in the pool, which our son loved. Pictures of cottage is accurate. Communication with hosts efficient and check in/check out very easy and smooth process. Cats super cute!",location
"The host made us feel very welcome! The neighborhood is quiet yet close to restaurants, bars and coffee shops. The backyard area, pool hot tub and grill are the highlight of this airbnb!!! It is AMAZING!",location
Elizabeth was really accommodating as we booked on short notice. The cottage was cozy and private. We didn't get to use the pool or the jacuzzi because we didn't have time but it looks great. I would stay here again. ,location
Nice hosts and delicious snacks,clean
"Elizabeth and William have a beautiful home.  The room was clean and well stocked, and thankfully the air conditioning was working!  The pool area is also perfect for relaxing after a long day - would definitely recommend and stay again",clean
"The cottage and pool are perfect for a brief stay in Silver Lake (LA). Although we did not use the pool, it was definitely a tranquil and pleasant part of the property's setting. We had all of the amenities needed (wi-fi, a/c, coffee, snacks, a mini fridge and the washer dryer was a plus) for a short stay, but no TV.  Parking on the street was ample and the hosts were very responsive and helpful.",location
The host canceled this reservation 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.,clean
This place is great. You won't find a better location for all things Hollywood/Beverly Hills. Karen is extremely easy to communicate with. I will be back for sure.,location

"Great place in a cool, quiet neighborhood. We will be back.",location
"This place is very spacious and clean. It's in a nice neighborhood near everything - very walkable with nearby shops and restaurants on the main road.<br/><br/>Karen greeted us at the entrance when we arrived and had cold water bottles, tea, coffee etc., in the kitchen. She provided us with a printout/guide of places to see and visit. She checked in on us via texts a few times just to make sure we were doing well and enjoying our stay, very thoughtful and considerate. <br/><br/>The apartment itself is so much bigger than I expected. There's a huge living room and also another huge lounging area in the kitchen. Cold AC units throughout the property. Very well kept. Very clean and presentable. <br/><br/>We will probably not be looking at hotels next time we visit just because Karen's place is a much better value and simply feels like home. ",clean
Very nice area and close to everything! Karen is super sweet! I would definitely recommend :),location
"a lovely humble apartment in West Hollywoood, quite enough for two to three persons. Karen was so helpful & understanding. glad we stayed with her.",clean
"Staid with a friend at Karen's place for 2 nights, had an awesome time in a lovely neighborhood. The place was clean and looked exactly as it did in the pictures. During our stay we were looking for a power adapter to charge our phones, Karen was friendly enough to lend us two ensuring we got on our way back home fully charged. All in all a very nice experience. Would recommend highly to anyone looking for a great West Hollywood place to stay. ",clean
"The location is excellent, quiet, and seemed safe to me.  The apartment itself is a makeover, a little oddly laid out, but comfortable.  A couple and two other people on fold-outs would be fine here.  I had one small issue, and Karen took care of it immediately, as she did my initial inquiry and booking details.  ",location

I had a family member that I was visiting at Cedars Sinai Hospital and it was a breeze getting back and forth each day.  Grocery stores, pharmacy, shopping and restaurants are all close by, and Karen includes a list of all the great places.  The place is roomy, clean and quiet and you canât ask for a better host!",clean

Amazing place in a great location,location
Karen's place was a treat! After long days at the convention center for E3 we got to kick our feet up and relax at her spacious studio. <br/><br/>She was also very quick to respond to all of my messages and very accomodating.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend her place.,location
The space was perfect for our weekend getaway. The location was perfect for our weekend plans and Karen was very helpful in assuring we enjoyed our stay. ,location
This place is the ABSOLUTE best place Iâve EVER stayed at!! I highly recommend Karenâs home.

If this place isnât booked on my future trips I will definitely be staying here and nowhere else.,location

Centrally located it was easy 30min or less driving distance to everything on our list: Universal Studios, Warner Bros Studios, Hollywood sign, Santa Monica, Venice Beach! <br/><br/>Karen was very friendly and welcoming and gave us the full walk through of the space to help us get settled upon arrival. Check in was a breeze! <br/><br/>She had the space all set up with the appropriate amenities (blankets, towels, pillows, etc) for the 4 of us. We were already talking about making a return trip to LA and would not hesitate to book with Karen again! Highly recommend!",location

Lovely place in a super location!  Very nice and welcoming.,location
Lovely hosts and a nice and convenient home for a long stay in LA midtown.,location
"Karen was friendly, place was larger than I expected. If you have a car, the space provided is difficult to fit anything more than a compact car. Also would have been nice to have a tv in common room rather than bedroom. We werenât in the place much and it served the purpose of cooking us off and giving us a place to sleep and shower. Karen responded promptly and the place was very clean/uniquely decorated. Would recommend. ",clean
Karen is a super host.<br/>Very kind and available. <br/>The apartment is lovely and there is everything that you need.<br/>I hope to come here again!,location
"Place was amazing, clean, comfortable and in a great location.  Karen was a great host and the new smart TV was a great addition to the space. ",clean
"Karen has an awesome home up in the Hollywood Hills.  The place was very clean, and very comfortable. The location was amazing- up a steep hill off of Sunset Blvd.  Although we had a car, we chose to park it at Karen's and walk down the hill to Sunset Blvd to the restaurants and to catch our tour bus.  The neighborhood was incredible and it was fun to walk and see all the beautiful homes.  Karen was a wonderful host, and I would definitely stay here again without hesitation.      ",location
"Karenâs place was the best! Been to LA twice before and staying at Karenâs was hands down my favorite experience. Prime location right above Sunset Blvd, most Uberâs were very cheap. Karen provided a print out of fun things to do which made everything a bit easier. Also ran into a couple celebrities on our trip. Would absolutely book again.",location
"The host is very nice and helpful. She always gave her best during my stay. I borrowed a hair dryer and hers was broken, she got me a new one. She always responded quickly. Her place is neat and comfy. Weâre very much satisfied.",clean
Karen's place is in a great neighborhood (in the hills of West Hollywood) and full of light. There was plenty of room for our whole family of 5 (three teenagers and two adults). Karen was always responsive and made sure our stay went well. We had absolutely no issues with our quick getaway to LA. We would definitely stay at her place again!,clean
"Karenâs place is a fantastic place to stay! The bed is comfy, the kitchen is fully equipped, overall very spacious, and pretty central to all the great spots. Karen really is a super host! ",location
"We found this place to be the perfect place to stay for our LA adventures! Karen is very friendly and the communication was great from the start. The beautiful house is in a very nice and quiet area of West Hollywood, but it is just a short walk away from the action in Sunset Blvd, where you find lots of nice places to eat and drink. The apartment was nice and spacious, and with a comfortable bed. The living room was a nice place to relax at night after coming back, and we enjoyed the Smart TV there.",location
Karen is a very friendly and welcoming person. Parking in the driveway was easy. The bed was very comfortable and a complete household was provided. Only the bathroom was a little bit disappointing and the sound insulation to the main house isn't very good.<br/>But overall we had a very pleasant stay.,clean
"We stayed for 5 nights at Karenâs place and can really recommend it! <br/><br/>The location is perfect to reach major sightseeingâs of LA and good restaurants nearby. Itâs situated in the quiet neighborhood in West Hollywood.<br/><br/>Karen has been a terrific host, providing all the necessities we could need during our stay, as well as an extensive recommendation list for tourists :)  <br/><br/>The apartment was really clean, spacious and lovely to stay at with a great bed!!<br/><br/>We would definitely stay here again!",location
"Karen's place is located in a very quiet and calm part of the hills, but it is close to sightseeing and other places of interest. Good night sleep guaranteed for even light sleepers.<br/>Karen is also a very hospitable and helpful host. She has great tips for things to do in LA and nearby. Definitely can recommend!",location

Sandra was a lovely and attentive host! She responded quickly to questions/requests and went the extra mile to have her family make my family feel welcome.,host
"Overall, our stay was pleasant.  The apartment was spacious, located in a nice area, and the hosts were communicative.  The hosts also ordered WiFi especially for us, which we appreciated given our work obligations.  We would, however, suggest better cleaners in the future.  We needed to re-wash the dishes and clean the apartment upon arrival.  Otherwise, we appreciate the hospitality and recommend this Airbnb for other guests.",clean
"Sandra was communicative and prompt at responding. Awesome location, in between and close to a lot of the hot spots in LA. Great conversations with Sandraâs welcoming and friendly father, who lives next door.",location
"This is my second stay with Sandra and her family.  The house is perfect!   Itâs cozy, private, large, clean, and centrally located to everything.   Thereâs great internet, great parking, and the host responds quickly to messages.  I will always try and get Sandraâs place when Iâm coming into LA.  Itâs often booked, so if you get the chance you should choose this air-b.  You wonât be disappointed!",clean
"I stayed for a month when I moved to LA. Nice place with plenty of room. Parking space is a big plus. Sandra was communicative, checking in and out was easy.",location
"Absolutely choose this Airbnb! It has so much charm, good energy, and is thoughtfully decorated. Everything you need for a short or long term stay. The outdoor seating area and parking spot are cherries on top! Felt very very safe. Loved it and would absolutely stay again!",location
"I stayed a month in Sandraâs place, this is an old house that would benefit from a full renovation to get rid of some small inconveniences.<br/>However, said inconveniences are minor and none of them affected my stay.<br/>To the contrary, I appreciated the lived feeling that the house offers.<br/>On top of that, Sandraâs outstanding responsiveness and communication more than compensated for any shortcoming that her place might have.<br/>For example, as soon as I arrived, I was greeted by spotless cleanliness and thoughtful attentions like bottled water in the kitchen.<br/>The air conditioner and space heaters, which Sandra provided, were sufficient to keep the house warm in winter.<br/>Within days, Sandra also provided a foldable desk that I needed to work with my laptop and had the sink food waste disposer fixed immediately, after I told her that it was not working.<br/>The house itself is spacious, some guests might have preferred a sofa bed over the daybed that is in the living room because the latter does not offer back support and is not comfortable to watch TV while sitting on it.<br/>There is a lounge chair that can be used for that purpose, but it only sits one person.<br/>The kitchen has more than enough space to feel comfortable even if you cook every day.<br/>A long corridor steals space without serving any purpose but that is just how old houses were built.<br/>The bedroom is large, has three windows with blinds and curtains and the medium-firm mattress provided restful nights.<br/>Lastly, the neighborhood felt safe and even if I did not have a car during my stay a Vons' grocery, laundromat and dry cleaner were all within walking distance.<br/>Fast food and restaurants could also be reached by walking when I did not want to cook. <br/>To sum it up, I had a great stay at Sandraâs guests house and would surely return if I had the occasion.",clean

Front room is a little small, but the bed and pillows were SO comfy and a nice reprieve from our other airbnb experience! Tip to other guests-- The hosts generally hang around the home (and so did we), so the space feels shared. However, we kept to ourselves mostly and had a great experience.",clean

Everything was as good as it was described in the host's page. The garden/patio with the pool is so beautiful and well kept and the little cottage room was squeaky clean. All toiletries needs were there and so were some snacks and more. Location is in the hearth of LA so it is easy to drive everywhere.  We'll definitely will go there again.,clean
"We stayed in the cottage and absolutely loved it.  The entire ambiance of the place makes you feel very peaceful.  It is in a great location, and parking is very easy on either side of the street.  Everything was labeled for you in the cottage. There were extra sheets and comforters, a mini fridge, an iron and ironing board, washer, dryer, and best of all complimentary snacks, which definitely came in handy.  There are several bars and restaurants in walking distance, which made for great sight seeing.  There is one bed and a futon.  The shower's head doesn't move, so make sure you get in the shower before you turn the water on or else there will be a puddle on the floor.  The backyard is gorgeous, whether you utilize the pool or not.  The jacuzzi was also really lovely and easy to use. There are not enough positive words I can say about this place!<br/><br/>Elizabeth was very easily accessible and was able to answer any and all questions that we had very promptly.  I would definitely recommend staying here and I would love to stay with them again! ",location

let me start off by first saying the location is amazing and the host karen is great. when we arrived we were very pleased with the location and the way the place looked from the outside. The house was undergoing renovations. karen showed us around and thats when we noticed a few things. The layout is quite odd as well as she does not allow food or drink in two twin mattresses pushed together. This did not go over well as it was very uncomfortable.  The next morning we contacted karen and she gave us a refund right away and we were able to find another place to stay for the rest of our trip. karen was very nice and helped us out and she messaged me shortly after saying that she had purchased a new king sized mattress. the ac units are very loud and you can see and hear the pipes in the ceilings as well as you can hear people upstairs and the tv at night.,location
If you like to walk around there are no sidewalks in the neighborhood until you get to Sunset blvd. As far as the place it has everything you need even the beach towels.,location
"Karen is a lovely host, very reactive every time we had a request and she took the time to help us plan our stay and gave us wonderful advice. The appartement is well located, quiet, modern and well decorated. The bed is large and super comfortable, the kitchen well equipped. Everything was perfect!!",location

Great location above the Sunset Strip.  Karen is a great host....,location
"Everything from check in to check out was a breeze. We slept great on the comfy King bed and had plenty of room to cook/eat and hangout. Location was phenomenal. Parking spot was great. <br/><br/>I read a few reviews initially about the parking space being compact size only... Not true. We fit our BMW 750i with no issue and there aren't many cars longer than that. You might have trouble with a very large SUV. Either way, there's plenty of street parking on Doheny.<br/><br/>Anyway, the apartment was clean and cozy. We will definitely be back on our next stay in LA.<br/><br/>Thanks, Karen!!",clean

Everything you need is there and if you like to cook, thatâs available too. <br/><br/>Karen was very helpful and guided us to a great spot for dinner our first night. She was always around when we had a question or needed her (and stayed away when we didnât need anything).

"Wow! We could not have asked for a more gorgeous, more welcoming, accommodating rental and host! Elizabeth is genuinely one of the warmest souls you'll meet. Our rental had some ridiculous circumstances... we were doing a fashion photo shoot for my mom and not only was Elizabeth totally willing to work with us in terms of the check in and check out times, she came out and checked on us, and went so far as to make sure we had access to a bathroom for the tail end of our shoot after our checkout time. The space itself is unbelievable! Tucked away on a quiet street in the heart of Los Angeles with an insanely gorgeous pool surrounded by lush greenery, palm trees, an awesome raised wooden deck, and the most beautiful outdoor patio I have ever seen. This place and this host are the epitome of perfect. Five stars. Two thumbs way up. A great value. A piece of paradise... any way you want to say it, this place is amazing!",host

"We weren't able to meet Elizabeth but she was very helpful with her messages. We found tips about restaurants and things to do in L.A. in the room. The house is in a great area and you can find everything you may need within walking distance. The room is nice, although quite small, the shower is really good and the space outside was beautiful.

"My stay at Elizabeth and Williams' place was great. I had a friend coming into town who needed a place to stay, but I would still be out of town from a music festival so I booked her a night at Elizabeth and Williams' cottage in Los Feliz. Their place is wonderful and within walking distance to many Silverlake/Los Feliz neighborhood haunts. The cottage was equipped with all the amenities one needs to stay for a night or an extended stay (weeks). Elizabeth was my main contact and was flexible and very accommodating. I was too busy showing my friend around for the day, and did not get a chance to personally meet her. Although like I told her, I would recommend her place to any of my friends. This is a rare find for the value and location, not to mention how accommodating the host(s) are. ",location
We had the cottage and had everything we needed and more.  Elizabeth was very accommodating and always so quick to respond to messages.  The place was absolutely beautiful and within walking distance to the grocery store and lots of restaurants and bars or just a short uber ride if you prefer.,location
We had a great experience here overall. A nice getaway for my girlfriend and I. Drinking wine by the pool/hot tub/ fire place with some music playing was the cherry on top of our night. Would definitely return here.,location
Great place to stay! Nice to be away from the tourist areas of LA. It's so easy just to catch ubers everywhere to do the tourist thing aswell. Pool was amazing as LA is so hot!! The hosts were lovely and so helpful and respond really quickly. Los Feliz is a nice town and safe we loved it! Definitely recommend staying here. ,location

Olivia's apartment is in a great location in West Hollywood and extremely convenient. She was very quick to respond to my questions in the apartment was neat as a pin. ,clean
"Great place! The location was amazing, very close to beverly hills and had a ton of stuff to do in west hollywood. Karen was very nice and welcoming, even left a few water bottles in the fridge for us! The place was spacious, the only issue I would like to point out is that the shower has a slanted ceiling. It does have a removable shower head which makes it easier and it was perfect for me and my friend who are 5â5â and under; if you were traveling with someone much taller it may be an issue. Karen was quick to respond and overall it was a fantastic trip! The price for the location is amazing and we would definitely stay again!!",clean

At quick glance, it's just as the pictures show! Parking is always a huge source of stress for me so I was a little worried there wasn't a ""spot"" but I never had an issue finding a spot right on their street. If stay here again in a heart beat.

"Elizabeth was quick at responding, I had asked for an early check in. She was able to do that for us but we were out sightseeing so didn't end up going early, it was great knowing she was able to do that for us.

Next time we will make Karenâs place our first choice. Our stay was perfect",clean

I really enjoyed looking from the outside. The location in the Hollywod Hills and the Sunset Strip is outstanding.<br/>In the fridge were a few bottles of water. That was good, not having to go shopping right at the beginning. The bed is pleasantly soft.<br/>I'm looking forward to staying here again when I'm back in LA.",location

There is nice big bed for my wife and I to sleep in and AC in every room. The useable washer and drier are a massive plus as we didnât have any laundry to do once we got back home after a long day of flying. This place was clean and organized. We enjoyed our stay.",clean

"I was a long-stay guest at Karen's and I found the experience to be simply wonderful! The space is HUGE and had character, was immaculate and very peaceful. I had all that I needed and if I ever needed anything else, Karen was always on hand to help me. The space was cleaned once a week by a trusted housekeeper for the 6 weeks I stayed and she was very professional and friendly. It's a short walk to Sunset Blvd and by car it was so quick to get to anywhere really. Location was unbeatable! All in all, I'd highly recommend!",clean
Karens home is wonderful and you immediately feel welcomed and at home. The location is supreme and 10/10 for LA. The living room is spacious and offers an amazing view over the hills. Great facilities and also a very calm and cosy bedroom. Karen is the best host you can imagine and is very kind and helpful. This is my best AirBnB stay to date.,location
"This is a wonderful house , perfect for a family with two children. The terrace and the view on the ocean is fabulous! . Everything is well equipped and Kristen was a great host .

"Fantastic back yard, really nice oasis after a couple of busy days. ",location
This was our first experience with Airbnb and I have to say we will do this again!! Although I did not personally meet either Elizabeth or William anytime I had a question or concern all I had to do was send a message through my airbnb account and Elizabeth responded within hours. <br/>They have a beautiful place and just what we needled as we really only needed a place to sleep and shower. <br/><br/>We found a really neat place to eat that was within 10 minutes walking distance called The Sitdown (pizza and Italian). If you go and it is warm outside ask for the back outdoor seating. The baked ziti was delicious. <br/><br/>Shawn and I highly recommend reaching out to this couple for your next visit to LA. ,location

"Had a really great experience staying at the ""Bachelor Studio.""   I found all of my communications with Olivia to be quickly replied too in the booking and check-in process.  Checking in was super easy and I found the place to be as advertised.  As such, it meant my needs for my trip.  I found street parking to be fairly simple and much easier than other parts of LA. I never couldn't find a legal spot.  The unit itself was clean and cozy, and while it lacks a kitchen, per se, there is a mini-fridge for snacks and drinks and a whole host of great spots a block or two in all directions.  I'd certainly stay there again.",clean
Clean tidy safe.<br/>The perfect place for my stay (business/pleasure).<br/>Thank you Olivia :) ,clean

Though we did not get to meet her, she was very accommodating through text and promptly replied to all our questions. Parking was never an issue and the neighborhood was safe and lively with plenty of things to do within walking distance. Our favorite places were the Grove, farmers market and canter's deli. We highly recommend it!",clean
"Six of us (including two teens) stayed in this house for a week.  The owner, Kristen was very responsive and inviting.  I believe this is the owners primary residence, so great care is taken to keep the house so nice.   The house is as described with a bottom floor and balcony level deck.  Doors to the decks open wide providing a breeze.  We were concerned about the lack of AC, but it wasn't a problem.    <br/>The home is beautifully designed, and equipped with nearly everything you would need to enjoy the home.  Kitchen had everything we needed, including nice pots and pans and appliances.   The home is clean and modern.  The house is really perfect.<br/>It has a two car garage.  If you rent a car, you must use the garage, there is no street parking option there.  The garage is shallow, so check with the owner to make sure your rental car will fit. (we had only a few extra inches)<br/>Venice beach is not for everyone.  Do your research and make sure Venice is for your traveling family.   Having said that, this house is located on a more quiet part of Venice beach strand and we truly enjoyed the beachfront property and the beautiful deck. ",clean

"The best thing about this clean little apartment is the location; it is a short walk to Melrose/Fairfax shopping and centrally-located so you can take an Uber everywhere else. Olivia was very polite, fast and clear in her communication. I had a small issue with the next-door neighbor playing very loud music on Friday night and at around 2am Sunday night/Monday morning, which woke me up, but Olivia responded to my complaint immediately and the neighbor turned their music down within 20 minutes. All in all it was a great place to stay for my visit.",clean
"Perfect spot for my short 2 days there. Location was great, and in a safe neighborhood, right off Fairfax. Definitely need an uber to get to Hollywood Blvd area, but it's only like $6.00. Olivia was very informative and prompt with all communication. Everything happened so seamlessly. I give this a 10 out of 10. I Definitely recommend staying here and I'm looking forward to coming again soon! ",location

"Olivia was a really good host, check-in was a breeze and she replied to all my questions very quickly and went above and beyond to provide all sorts of recommendation to make our trip as easy as possible. The location was great, short walk to a lot restaurants/bars.  The unit could be a bit cleaner... it's understandable that an older building will have few spiders... <br/>I think the timing of our trip wasn't ideal. We went during a heat wave where LA got up to 105 degree. The small air conditioning unit was on the coldest setting but still felt like a sauna in there. We also went during a very busy week in LA. Parking outside the building was hard to come by, we had to circle around the block for 10-15 minutes each night only to find spots a block or 2 away. ",location
"I had a 2 night stay over at Olivia's. The place is a cosy little studio apartment. Exactly what I was looking for. It was in a lovely area (small walk from some great restaurants and bars) I hadn't noticed that there was no kitchen, however you do have a small fridge and table and chairs which was enough for me. It was my first air bnb experience and it was so easy! Thanks for having me Olivia! See you next time I'm sure.",host
"Me and my friend enjoyed our stay. It's a cute little appartment in a nice area. It's close to shopping and bars, only 5-10 minutes away by car to other nice areas in Hollywood. The only thing we missed was a kitchen area. It was only a small fridge so if you want to cook it's not the best place for it. I would highly recommend this place if you're just looking for a nice place to crash and to be close to west Hollywood. We really enjoyed or stay!",location

"We really enjoyed our stay at Chas's apartment. The location is great - very close to the beach and to various amenities in Venice, as well as a short drive from anything on the Westside. The apartment itself was very comfortable, and Chas was easy to communicate with. ",location
"Chas' apartment is exactly as the photos describe it. We arrived and the apartment was clean and welcoming. The bed was comfortable and the living room had a nice airy feel with lots of light coming in. Location is great, really close to Rose and a couple of blocks walk from the beach. ",clean
"Chas' apartment was in a great location and the apartment itself was very nice and just as advertised. Unfortunately there were several things that prevented this from being an entirely satisfactory stay. On first arriving I used the towel hanging up in the bathroom to dry my face. I wrongly assumed this would be clean but it smelt really badly and clearly hadn't been washed prior to our arrival. Another problem which was indicative of a lack of preparation for our arrival was the filthy cooking pots left for us in the cupboard. Neither had been washed, they had sticky sauce all over them and one even had bits of dried food stuck in it. This was really disappointing to us. We also didn't have great communication with Chas. The first three messages I sent him received no response. Perhaps this wouldn't bother some people as they were just messages such as 'thanks for accepting us' and notifying him that we needed to change our dates slightly etc.. But in comparison with all other Airbnb experiences I've had where hosts have been super friendly and responsive, it was strange getting no reply from him. So a mixed review really. Chas seemed nice enough, and he let us stay late on the day we were leaving as our flight wasn't till 10pm and we had nothing to do with our luggage. This was greatly appreciated. However there were too many annoying and unpleasant incidents to allow me to write an entirely positive review. I think this has the potential to be a great Airbnb apartment if there is a bit more effort put in to it. ",clean
"Nicole met me and showed me around her beautiful house at check-in. I immediately fell in love with this place. Nice views and great neighborhood.

"Nicole's house was even better than I imagined, such a welcoming, quiet place in LA, I felt really lucky to find this house on my first time on air bnb. The house and the neighborhood were awesome, we even saw some squirrels on the trees in the afternoon, I would definitely come back. ",location

Nestle so close to everything including Griffith park observatory, Los Feliz, Echo park and the 5 freeway.<br/><br/>definitely would stay again. Thanks Sarah!",location
"Sarah was very helpful and quick to respond. You can text her and she will answer right back. The place looks exactly like it appears in the picture. It's super clean and well kept. Kitchen is well stocked with utensils in case you want to cook for yourself. Shower booth is also pretty spacious and the bathtub is really clean. One thing that I overlooked was that it is located in the basement. So not much sunlight, but it works well for warm weather. The bed was really comfy and spacious, and apple TV was a killer. <br/>There is no blow dryer so bring your own! The description of the location is pretty accurate. It is right at the heart of los feliz. Griffith Park is a walking distance. Parking was easy so that was a big plus. Overall, I enjoyed my stay at this studio. ",clean
"Sarah was communicative and quick to respond to questions. The check-in process she provided was easy to follow and straightforward. The studio itself was clean and centrally located (lots of shops and eateries/cafes close by). It looks like the studio was converted from a storage space - there is good ceiling height though, so that's not a problem. But it is a bit below ground level, and you will get whiffs of car exhaust through the windows if someone backs up into their parking spot. On our last day there, a lady scratched our Civic while exiting the parking lot, we parked diagonally in our spot as directed, but still got dinged. Might be best to park on the street if you find parking there, unless you're driving a something super tiny. Good news is, she left a note even though we were not there when she hit the car, which I really appreciate. ",clean
Loved Nicole ' s home. She is an awesome host and very easy going. Her place is beautiful and zen-like. I would definitely go there again when I head back to LA.,host

We would definitely love to come back one day! ",clean
"We stayed at Nicole's beautiful Silver Lake cottage for a couple of nights and felt right at home from the moment we walked into the front yard. Private and spacious, the home was absolutely perfect for our needs. My four-year-old daughter loved - LOVED - the tree swing and we had a great time hanging out on the private deck that really made us feel like we were out in nature instead of nestled within a major city. The house itself is unique and was extraordinarily clean and tidy. Perfect in every way - would recommend to anyone and would love to stay here myself on another visit to the LA area.",location
We absolutely loved staying at Nicole's home. It was so cute and in such a great location.

"Great stay at Sarah's studio in Los Feliz. The unit was comfortable,  quiet, clean, and stocked with lots of little nice to haves (speakers! ice!). The building is obviously in a great neighborhood but the parking and location of the unit in the building made getting in and out even easier. <br/><br/>Sarah was very communicative with a few questions we had. Thanks Sarah.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor: walk out the door, head up Vermont Ave, and don't stop until you reach the peak of Mt. Hollywood.",location
"Our stay in LA was great. Accommodation was exactly what we needed and in an ideal location. It was close to some great cafes, and great running and walking tracks. Very comfortable stay and highly recommended. ",location
"Sarah's place is awesome!!  Check-in was super easy and very well explained.  The apartment is adorable and a great size, especially for a studio.  It's very comfy and is stocked with almost all needs!  My only complaint is that it was without an iron (something I use a lot).  Just something to note, if you need one as well.  I picked up a mini steamer since my stay was for two months.<br/><br/>It's a garden apartment, so the windows don't open.  That being said, the place gets tons of light and is very airy!  There is no A/C but I was OK through most of July and August with just the fan.  If you're a light sleeper, the walls within the building are a little thin, but I was always able to doze back off if woken.<br/><br/>The location cannot be beat.  It's in a great, super hip and fun area.  Lots of good stuff within walking distance.  I think if I ever moved to LA, I would want to be in Los Feliz for sure!! <br/><br/>Sarah is a fantastic host, she's super responsive and very helpful.  I really loved my stay and felt amazingly at home the whole time! ",clean
Sarah was so great! Her instructions were clear and the apartment was exactly like the pictures. I couldnt recommend  this area more! Its close to everything  and los feliz is super cool. Sarah answered any questions  i had and made me feel very comfortable. Would highly recommend.,location
"PERFECT!  You will have a hard time finding such a perfect place to stay at such a great price.  We arrived very late at night and did not have ANY trouble getting into the place.  Fortunately, we have friends in this neighborhood (a block away!) so we didn't need to ask for recommendations, however Sarah was very willing to help.  She was very sweet and always responded to my messages quickly.  The apartment is exactly like the pictures and I was even more surprised about having towels there (small thing but it is definitely something you would forget if you are used to staying in a hotel).  The only down side was there was not air conditioning and unfortunately we were there during a heat wave (90 degrees) but I am very aware the NO ONE has AC so it wasn't a big deal.  The fan was just perfect!<br/><br/>If you stay here, some food places within walking distance we went to were Cafe Los Feliz (AMAZING), Jeni's Ice Cream, and Simply Thai.  My friend will now have her guests stay here from now on as it is such a wonderful place and in a great neighborhood!  BONUS:  Parking space (which is hard to find in LA)!  Thank you Sarah!",clean
"Sarah's place is great. I had a lovely time there. It's an amazing location, and very comfortable.",location
"My parents stayed in Sarah's place for two nights. We were a little worried when we entered the building and realized the studio is in the basement. That said, there was plenty of light from the windows, the studio was clean, there were candies and sparkling water left for us, and the location is very tough to beat.<br/><br/>All-in-all, it was a very good place for a short stay in Los Feliz.",clean
"I spent three months at Sarah's studio and they were three of the happiest months I could imagine. It's a beautiful, perfectly-formed space, with tasteful and comfortable decor, a great Apple TV with access to Netflix etc., a fully equipped kitchen, plenty of storage and - best of all - a corner bath to soak in.<br/>The neighbourhood is one of the best in LA. Hillhurst, with its restaurants, bars, coffee shops and yoga studios, is minutes away on foot.<br/>Sarah was a brilliant host - always available for queries but never intrusive. Everything was so well explained and worked perfectly. It was also great having my own parking space.<br/>Although the studio is in a basement, there is loads of natural light during the day and then, at night, I found I slept really well. There's occasional footfall from the people who live upstairs but nothing bad. The laundry room was easy to access and use.<br/>I can't think of enough nice things to say about this studio. For the location and quality it offers, it is truly excellent value and I am jealous of whoever gets to stay here next.<br/>Thank you Sarah, for making me feel so welcome in your lovely space.",location
I booked this but two of my friends ended up staying there. They were booked for two nights but they found it so romantic that after the first night they drove to Las Vegas and got married- so I think that's probably a sign that they loved it! ,location
"We loved our stay! The room was clean and comfortable, and the coffee/keurig set up was quite a treat! Their backyard/pool/hot tub was incredible! Such a beautiful setting and a great neighborhood. We walked to restaurants with no problem, plus 2 theaters within walking distance as well. Elizabeth was very helpful throughout our stay. ",location

"The room was comfortable, bed especially awesome, with lots of little amenities here and there (fancy granola bars, shampoos).  The pool and hot tub however beat the band-- very gorgeous yard. Our only regret is we didn't light a fire  and have s'mores in the beautiful fireplace!  Secluded, quiet and within walking distance to great neighborhoods full of restaurants and movies, etc.  The hosts were so kind and in great communication.  Three cheers to this spot!!!",location
"Nicole's house is warm & Cozy as Nicole is welcoming, she greeted us and show us around the house, even though the house is tiny, but we feel very peaceful and comfortable, we really like the patio and small yard, and we enjoyed TV at living room as well, would like to say it's a little paradise, as Nicole is very helpful and respectful, she could replied us very efficiency.",location

The place was spotless upon arrival, had every amenity we could need, and was located super close to so many great silver lake spots. <br/><br/>Nicole was a great communicator, check in was a breeze, and she even helped us out with a later checkout. 100% recommended, will be back for sure.

"We were in search of a home away from home while in LA and Nicole's beautiful house provided all that and more. Although in the heart of buzzing Silverlake and only a short walk to Sunset, the house feels truly private and secluded.  Surrounded by tall trees and two great outdoor garden spaces this spot is perfect for outdoor living.  We enjoyed BBQ's every night on the gorgeous wooden deck and cooked with pleasure from Nicole's well equipped kitchen. Would stay again in a heartbeat!",location
"Nicole was very welcoming, and her house is charming, although the steps to he house might be an issue for older guests, and the house was not really within walking distance of the best restaurants, etc. in Silver Lake.",location
"Nicole's place was absolute perfection. Nestled in the hills on a dead end street was this little LA oasis that truly made vacation worth it.  Waking up each morning to the sights and sounds of this property was such a wonderfully serene experience. It was all that I expected and more!  My daughter also enjoyed the age appropriate toys and things available.  All in all, we truly felt like this was a place we would dream living in.  I hope to return someday as my family is already begging me to promise that we will return.  Thank you Nicole for your prompt and courteous responses to any questions we had. Much appreciated! ",location
"Nicole's place was fantastic and so was Nicole!  The staircase leading to her home was super cool (and if you're so inspired, you can keep climbing to the top and check out the beautiful neighborhood from up there). The private space surrounding her house was simply amazing. It felt like I was in a child's storybook. Seriously. And being nestled in nature and surrounded by beautiful flowers and trees and the sounds of birds everyday was blissful. The cottage was cozy and very comfortable with all the amenities you need. Nicole was communicative, welcoming and available; she shared the gems of Silver Lake, of which there are plenty (definitely check out Little Pine restaurant). I loved my time there. It was truly a magical experience.  ",location

I highly recommend staying at Elizabeth and William's cottage. The living space is well equipped with everything you need from toiletries to a Keurig to plenty of closet storage area. The bed was extremely comfortable. The best part of our stay was the backyard pool area. It felt like an oasis in the middle of LA! There were many restaurants and bars within walking distance and we loved the proximity to Griffith Park for hiking. Elizabeth and William were easily available by messaging and seemed genuinely interested in making sure we had a great stay (Elizabeth even brought us ice for our cocktails after we realized we forgot to pick some up!).,location

Ideal location not far from Hillhurst, Vermont and Sunset Junction and Metro Sunset/Vermont. Dinosaur down on Sunset:. lovely breakfast coffee and granola and yoghurt, plenty of places to eat, Starfish on Vermont the best Sushi.

Staying at Nicole's is an A+ experience. Comfortable and nicely furnished. Great outdoor space. The kitchen is well equipped to cook a meal.

"This was a lovely and suprisingly private urban oasis. We stayed here for a week and it was a great place from which to explore the city (we had a car) and come back to such a green and lush garden area, a shaded porch and a nice home. Our son had his own little cabin aside from the house which he thought was fantastic. Nicole was very communicative and helpful during her stay. Even though she was far away she managed to assist us with a medical issue and solved a problem with the house within a few hours after it occurred. Shops and restaurants and nice places to hang out all nearby. I would definitely recommend this place to any nice person or family. And what was so surprising: the relative quietness at night. I did not expect this at all, LA being such a bustling city full of traffic!!<br/>The stairs (featured in the art house film Echo Park) were noy a porblem to us at all.<br/>All in all a great stay for us.<br/>",location

"This really is a charming cottage, at the end of a cul-de-sac, and on a âsecret staircaseâ close to Silverlake and Sunset. The cottage is well appointed, and the guest quarters are a fab bonus if you are a larger group or have older children to stay. The real bonus though, is the outside space. This is basically a tree house, with a fantastic deck, and gorgeous little patio with swing. We spent almost all of our time at the cottage out there, and it was just lovely. Bargainous price too! <br/>Nicole was accommodating, great to deal with and I would absolutely rent from her again. Thanks for hosting us.",location

Thanks and hope to return soon!",location

We spent almost a week here and it was very nice. The cottage is small (pretty much just a bed - there's no tv but it does have a washer/dryer) but there's plenty of space in the outdoor area. The location is fantastic - it was about a 20 minute drive in any direction to what we wanted to see. The parking was a bit crowded but most days we ended up on the same block and never more than 3 blocks away.<br/>Elizabeth is a good host - she is friendly and went out of her way to remind us about the parking restrictions throughout the week. ,location

I was delighted to find extra toiletries, snacks, drinks available. The whole grounds are lovely and relaxing even if you choose not to use the pool. Everything was clean and comfortable. No TV in the room was great for me and suggestions for local eateries was super helpful. I love this central location and accessibility. One tip: With street cleaning, you might want to walk/cab it if you go out at night since finding parking on the right side of the street can be tricky coming back late. You just need to plan for this and there are so many great places in walking distance so I just left my car behind when I went out at night. Looking forward to a return visit!",clean

Elizabeth even includes maps for public transportations and guides.<br/><br/>The cottage itself is small as described. You won't have a TON of room if you bring a big suitcase (like me), but it's totally workable. We would absolutely recommend this gem of a cottage!<br/>",host
"Beautiful little cabin-like place nestled up on a hill. Private with lots of outdoor space. A little tough to climb up all the stairs with big suitcases but worth the trek, for sure. <br/><br/>Nicole was super helpful and responsive.",location
"Nicole was a terrific host, the place is amazing and relaxing.",location
"We stayed at Nicole's place for few days while visiting Los Angeles. Location is ideal, proximity to the main attractions (Griffith Observatory, Universal Studios, Hollywood Boulevard). We had a car but sometime we would take uber for a 10-15 dollars ride to city centre. The neighbourhood is really cool, very quiet, a lot of small, original houses hidden between the hills. Nicole's place is one of that, a gem hidden in the trees, very calm, very quiet, the ideal place to rest after a day in the city. The second bedroom is actually separated from the main house (but still very close) which is is super attractive if you travel with a teenager since they can have their privacy. Amenities are great, a lot of towels, bathroom products, kitchen is fully equipped and Nicole left also some food and drinks for us. Rules of the house are very simple and we felt really comfortable staying there as if it was our own place. As other people said there are about 30 stairs to reach the house but it is definitely worth it and it is not a big deal   at all unless you have serious mobility issues. I definitely advice to stay at Nicole's place and I would be happy to visit her another time!",location
"Lovely place, great location, very convenient, secluded, and relaxing! ",location
Elizabeth was extremely hospitable as always.  We always enjoy our stay here given the circumstances (visit to Children's Hospital).  It's great walking distance to the hospital which makes it extremely convenient for us.,location
"I absolutely loved living here and was sad to leave. The pool area is great for relaxing and reading. Elizabeth anticipates your every need and leaves snacks, water bottles, towels, cups, etc. in the closet. I highly recommend staying here!",clean
"We had a semi good stay but a weird emailing interaction afterwards with Elizabeth. The place was easy to find and great location. Parking was not an issue. We followed Elizabeth's directions to get into the cottage, however, she never mentioned there was a slight dip into the cottage which caused one of us to stumble into the cottage (seems like it was some sorta of a garage or storage room that got remoled Into a cottage). The cottage itself isn't anything fancy but has all the amenities you need for your stay: comfy bed, mini fridge, snacks, lots of towels and closet space, wifi and working ac. The pool/jacuzzi area is cute and pretty clean, we had the chance to use it later thah night, it was good and relaxing. However, the morning after we got woken up by some random people that were not guests sitting outside our room, they were waiting for a yoga class to start? It would have been nice if we would have gotten a heads up about the class and if the people would have kept it down a bit or not sat right outside our cottage to chat and take pictures. At that point we were already woken up by these people so we decided to take showers, get ready and head out. I messaged Elizabeth to let her know we were heading out. About 5 hrs later, she messaged me asking me if I knew what had happened to her toilet and shower, apparently it had clogged up and although she never uses that bathroom she knew it wasn't clogged before? So she sorta accused me of breaking her toilet at this point, I mentioned to her that we used the toilet and showered with no issues and did not notice anything backing up. She later mentioned she had a plumber removing the toilet and had to removed 2 white wipes from the drain. I had forgotten m baby wipes at the cottage so she assumed it was our doing, however, she supplies her guest with disinfecting wipes and keeps them on top of the toilet, so it wouldn't surprise me if one of her previous guest or the new person that checked in at 3 (when she messaged me) did it or even the random people on the premises that were not guests. Also, if 2 wipes clogged all of her drainage system, I think she has bigger issues going on in that cottage. Long story short, the Next day, I get a money request from her asking to pay for the plumber, and how she was not charging me for her time, but the amount she was asking didn't match the picture of the receipt she sent over. I declined her request for money, messaged airbnb to help resolve this issue and now we are waiting to hear back.",location
"This place is honestly the best supplied studios I've ever stayed in. This place lacked nothing. Parking is easy to find. Communication was easy. Host always responded promptly.  She was very informative about parking and street sweeping. The room was so comfortable. There was air conditioning and an awesome bed. The pool was great, Its surrounded by a lush landscape. This is such a comfortable studio and it was difficult to leave. Certainly a place I would recommend to family and friends. ",location
"Great place, great host. ",location
Great place to stay. I think if you are looking to stay there for refreshment do nothing kind it is ideal given the outdoor facilities. The room itself is a bit small so any more than two would be a stretch. Elizabeth is a great host and very accommodating in terms of requests (can't be unreasonable ones though). All in all a great place.,location

The apartment is within walking distance of many local shops and restaurants. We loved our stay here and will hopefully be back in the future!",location
"The listing for Sarah's place was entirely accurate. Because the studio is in the basement, it stayed cool even though the LA temps soared to 104 degrees. A plus. On the minus side, Sarah did not respond to several attempts to reach her.  There is no coffee maker, so either bring your own or plan to go out for coffee every morning. We never did find the laundry, and since we were there for a month, had to take our sheets and towels out to get them washed.  Los Feliz is great, though, and we were very close to our daughter, son-in-law, and new granddaughter, and since that was the purpose of our visit, good enough. A place better suited, I think, to short term stays.",location
This is a very attractive and comfortable place to stay in Los Feliz with all the amenities. Recommended!,location
"What a great location the apartment is in. Everything was at our disposal and within walking distance. From restaurants,cafe's or to the supermarket. If we wanted to venture away from the area and explore LA we had the convenience of using Uber or public transportation. I would highly recommend staying at Sarah's place as it was very comfortable and spacious. If I had any questions about the apartment Sarah was prompt in answering them.",location
I had a good time in Sarah's studio apartment. I didn't see her in person but I got very good description via email with all the information I needed to find the place and to get by properly. When I needed her one time she was super responsive. <br/>The place itself is very clean and you find everything you need to live there like you would be at your own home. <br/>And this is the big YES to this place. I really felt like home there. So if you want to stay in Los Feliz I only can recommend staying at Sarah's place.<br/>,clean
"Sarah provided excellent instructions prior to our arrival and everything was in order for an enjoyable stay.  I didn't meet Sarah in person, but she was available to answer questions, if necessary.  Because the instructions that she provided were so clear and the apartment was exactly as advertised, I didn't have any need to contact her.  <br/><br/>Overall a great stay.  I would recommend to others.  ",clean
"This was my second time staying at Sarah's Place.<br/>We didn't  meet sarah but she always answered  my questions well. <br/>Although there is no air con the fan does an amazing job in keeping  the studio cool and we have stayed in summer before.<br/>The location is second to none it is honestly the best area, you can walk to shops cafÃ©s and amazing restaurants, right near griffith park and only 10min drive to sunset blvd and alot of other great places. I'm  sure we will be back",location
"Great location, excellent advance communication from Sarah, very comfortable apartment.",location
"Sarah's place was great and exactly what I wanted for my parents! Everything was ace, from location to cleanliness to convenience. My parents are getting a bit older, so they needed a place where they didn't feel like they needed to be out all the time to make the most of their stay in LA. The studio is in a cute, clean area, lots of little shops, restaurants, grocery store, near the park, etc. We also loved having the kitchen, bc when it was too hot outside, we stayed in, made a meal, and watched a movie. It stayed nice and cool inside, during the 100+ degree weather. I was afraid that it was going to be pretty dark, since it is a basement studio, but, there's lots of windows and plenty of light coming in.The place was super clean, my mom is a clean freak :), no complaints there! We did laundry in the building a couple of times, also a big plus. It was easy to get in when we first got there, instructions via email were detailed and easy to follow. There's 100% privacy, we were able to contact Sarah whenever we needed, but she left us to ourselves the whole time we were there. The place looks exactly like it does in the pictures. I definitely would stay here again! Thanks Sarah! ;)",clean
"We loved our stay in Sarah's studio, especially the convenience to our son's apartment next door! The directions were perfect for accessing the unit and it suited us perfectly. We appreciated the cleanliness and amenities and stayed cool with the ceiling fan. Los Feliz is a wonderful neighborhood to explore and very walkable. We hope to return again when we tire of soggy Seattle.",clean
"Nicoleâs house is an absolute haven in the middle of Silverlake. The smell of the flowers, all the wood and the nature is so good! Also the beds are really good and the host very communicative. Would love to come back again!",location
"This house is paradise. A pocket of tranquility right in the heart of bustling silverlake. Sparkling clean, welcoming and tranquil. Would live here if I could! Nicole is a fantastic host. Anyone is lucky to secure a booking on this house!",clean
Unexpectedly charming paradise. The pictures donât cut it. We spent most of our time enjoying the beauty of the oasis,location
"A beautiful home, charmingly situated and surrounded by trees and flowers. Lovely outside spaces for relaxing and eating. Convenient location with easy access to stores, and a lovely park a few minutes away.",location
Nicoleâs home is wonderful. A great private get away without having to be far away from all the action LA has to offer. It was a wonderful to just enjoy and relax in this home.,location
"Sarah was a fantastic host. She was very easy to get in contact with and was quick at dealing with anything we needed assistance with. The place was the perfect size for 2 of us to spend nearly a month feeling like we lived in LA. It was great to come to a place that had all we needed to feel homely. The area is amazing with lots of choice in cafes and restaurants, it seemed to be a very safe neighbourhood and was the perfect way to be close enough to everything we wanted in LA, but not be stuck in the middle of a really busy, touristy place. We would definitely recommend Los Feliz as an area, and Sarah's place to stay! Thanks Sarah!! :) ",location
"This was my first experience using Airbnb and it was amazing! Sarah's place was exactly how it's described, in a great location - minutes walk to super market / cafes etc. any questions I had she was quick to respond and her detailed instructions with how to check in made it very easy! Absolutely loved my stay and so glad this was my first time! Will be booking again in the future :) ",host
What an amazing place.  Nicole's house is stunning and in a great location.  I would highly recommend this as a place to stay.,location
"Nicoleâs place is an amazing spot to stay in LA with great amenities. Plus, Silver Lake is a good neighbourhood to explore in the city. I would definitely stay here again!",location
This was a beautiful house to stay in. It almost made us want to stay in! The house was in a great location and short drives/Uber to most places we visited. Would stay again!,location
"Nicoleâs place was our favorite thing about LA. Book with confidence, youâll be pleasantly surprised. Thanks for sharing your home with us, Nicole!",location
"This is a lovely home in a great location. Good kitchen, living space and several outdoor areas. Close to a lot of Silver Lake action down on sunset but tucked away so that itâs quiet and almost woodsy - the patio and greenery around it make for a really nice outdoor haven. Thereâs a great master bedroom and a smaller childâs room with a twin bed. The 3rd bedroom is a separate little cottage, so something to know is that one doesnât have itâs own bathroom and one needs to go into the main house. Very comfortable and easy though! Thanks for the great spot!",location
Amazing! Nicoleâs place is a magical oasis in Silver Lake. Easy to work from âhomeâ there and my coworkers were jealous of my amazing view from the patio. I really enjoyed my month long retreat during these uncertain times.,location
"This place is so cute! Great location in silver lake, beautiful view and awesome patio. Nicole is a wonderful host, she is very responsive and thoughtful!  She also made us feel safe with all the cleaning measures and supplies at home. Will definitely stay here again next time.",location
"The place is so cool and has way more space than you can see! Would definitely stay again! Nicole was extremely attentive, communicative and availableâone of my better AirBnb experiences!",location
Nicoleâs place was amazing. Her house is very secluded and you have everything you need for an enjoyable stay. I would highly recommend staying here if it is available. Check in/out is very easy and Nicole was very responsive.,location
"The price point is a good value for the area. I read the previous reviews, liked the exterior space and thought Iâd give it a go. I was traveling with my wife, her two teens and our 2 year old and staying a few days over Xmas. Communication with Nicole is very good and she is very helpful. The living space did accommodate us but other than the outdoor space, the interior space wasnât the best fit for our family. I didnât realize that parking is almost non existent. On two nights, I walked up and down a hill a block away.. The home is at the end of a dead end street and up two flights of city concrete stair. Once in the gate, there is a path and more stairs to the house. Not so bad if your not carrying a toddler or if your not physically challenged. If you are used to a turn key ABB this isnât the space for you. You are renting a home that has the feeling of being in someoneâs else personal space. There is a small bedroom that fits a queen and another smaller room that fits a twin bed for a child and small desk in the other. The third room is detached from the main rooms and is off the exterior deck with another queen bed and table with printer. Unfortunately, it rained our entire stay so we didnât get to enjoy the exterior. If you like a more bohemian environment then this could be your thing. It just didnât work for us.",location
"This was hands down one of the best Airbnbs Iâve stayed in. The space is cozy and lovely, and Nicole is a wonderful and generous hostâshe went so far as to supply some toddler gear for us, going out of her way to make our trip easier. <br/><br/>The patio is a total delight, with beautiful trees and foliage surrounding you (as well as the sounds of animals scampering aroundâyou really get an incredible feeling of being in nature even though youâre right in the middle of the city!). <br/><br/>We had read a review from someone who complained about the steps and how difficult it was to access the house and were unsure if the space would work for us because we have two toddlers and plenty of luggage. In fact it was totally fineâweâre reasonably fit and found the stairs to be fun and not overwhelming, so know that itâs all relative to what youâre used to in terms of physical effort. We are New Yorkers and walk everywhere so climbing some steps to get to a sweet paradise of an Airbnb was not biggie. <br/><br/>Oh, also for all those night-pee-ers out there, know that the third bedroom, which is a stand-alone structure across the way (a few feet) from the house, does not have its own bathroomâso you have to walk outside and into the main house to use the bathroom. Not a big deal but something to note. <br/>We wouldnât hesitate to book again and very highly recommend!!",location
best place ive ever stayed in <3,location
"This is by far, my favorite experience on AirBNB. This was beyond a charming cottage in Los Angelesâ¦ this was was a beautiful getaway retreat.. filled with so many cool spaces to relax. <br/>Not only did the space exceed my expectation, but so did the host!! Nicole was so friendly, informative, and kind throughout our stay. <br/><br/>There is this underlying magic about Los Angeles that Nicole has curated so perfectly in this space. Itâs hidden gems like this that make me fall in love with LA all over again.",location
"Great clean space, and location was great with nice views!",location
"Amazing spot, was amazing to have a âcabin in the woodsâ in the middle of LA. Stairs werenât too bad for us and was a really convenient location. We had street parking and there was never an issue with parking right at the bottom of the stairs.",location
"Nicoleâs place is simply great. A true oasis in the wonderful area of Silver Lake. We loved the terraces, the quietness, the beauty of the interior. Extra plus: the guest house! Nicole was easy to contact and responded within minutes. My family of three stayed for two weeks and we will return without any doubt. <br/>Highly recommended! Thanks Nic!",location
"Nicole is a really good host and provided everything we needed. The location is incredible, so glad I chose to stay here.",location
"Everything was perfect! The room was cozy, clean, and private. The host, Jon, was there when I needed him and completely out of my way when I wanted my privacy. The house is super cute and right in the middle of everything, yet private and quiet because it's up on a little hill. The backyard view during the day and night is extraordinary and great for a little LA fun. <br/><br/>Bars, restaurants, clothing stores, and just young hip area are steps away. The house is off the street so you feel privacy in a wonderful way, especially because as soon as you walk down the stairs to the street, you're only a few blocks away from the action.<br/><br/>I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. The house was very nice, Jon was a great and respectful host, I had a private entrance, and access to the backyard which was just perfect. Couldn't ask anything more from a stay. <br/><br/>I DEFINITELY recommend staying here... and cheaper than I'd think. Not to mention the cozy perfect little bathroom and beautiful foliage everywhere that Jon planted himself he said. <br/><br/>",location

Sara's studio apartment was very clean. It had a nice size bathroom with quality towels and complete kitchen. The bed was very comfortable and it had a great seating area.  There was absolutely no problem with the Wifi or the TV. It is perfectly located in a lovely residential area with coffee shops and restaurants close by. There is also parking available behind the apartment. I would recommend it without hesitation.,clean

I had a wonderful stuff at Sarah's place. It's in a great neighborhood with lots of good restaurants and amenities nearby. Sarah was a super communicative host. I definitely recommend her place!,location
Fabulous studio in a brilliant location. Everything was spotless and very tastefully decorated. Sarah's communication was excellent - her check-in notes were very informative and she replied very promptly to my email quite late at night when I couldn't work out how to operate the shower (my fault completely - turns out some American showers are different to Australian ones). Would definitely stay here again.,clean

We walked to every place we wanted to go go in Los Feliz, which was great and the parking spot was a huge plus as well! 10 out of 10 would recommend to anyone! We loved it and It definitely helped make our trip amazing!",location
"The location of Sarah's place is incredible. Very safe and quiet neighborhood with plenty of restaurants and shops. The studio looks exactly like the photos and was very comfortable even without AC. Our only complaint (which isn't anything Sarah can change) is the noise that we heard from the upstairs neighbor. We could literally hear every footstep and every drawer that was opened or closed. Despite that, we had an awesome stay and would stay again with some earplugs!",location
"Sarah is a very good communicator and provides clear check in instructions.  She was out of town during my stay, but advised me of this ahead of time and I never had any need to contact her anyway. <br/>The unit is a nice size and worked very well for one person.  Would be great for 2 as well.  Maybe even ok with young children.  <br/>Neighborhood is very walkable, felt safe and is conveniently located near cafes, restaurants, and grocery stores.  I LOVED the natural foods store just a couple of blocks away.  <br/>Coming back to Sarah's studio always felt like home when coming back from a day out.  There was one occasion where someone was parked in the unit's space but the car was gone within a few minutes and I could move my car into the assigned space.  <br/>",location
"Great location with walkability to restaurants, grocery stores, shops and cafes.",location
"Book with confidence! What an amazing place to stay. First, the location can't be beat. So close to Griffith Park and blue bottle coffee as well as a grocery store right down the street. Street parking as well as an assigned parking spot. Second, the place itself is just as advertised. Bright, clean, and colorful with plenty of space. Full kitchen and bathroom as well. It got pretty hot in LA while we were there (90ish), but Sarah's place stayed cool the whole time. Finally, Sarah herself was very responsive and always got back to us promptly. This place is worth every penny and I would love to stay again. Thanks Sarah! ",clean

The apartment is underground, and it is a bit stuffy with the hot weather.

"The pros of this sweet little basement apartment are; a parking spot, lots of restaurants and cafes near by (Cafe Los Feliz breakfast croissant!!!), laundry on the premises, well stocked with bathroom/kitchen essentials, easy communication with the host.<br/><br/>The cons; noise from upstairs apartment. If you're an early riser and a sound sleeper, you may not be bothered. No AC, but there is a fan that works well, and if you prop the door open you can get a good breeze going. <br/><br/>All in all, this was a good value, and felt like a home, which was nice for my long stay. I never met the host in person, but she was very easy to contact by text, and was friendly.",clean

Elizabeth's place was fantastic to stay at and she is a wonderful host. Very responsive in communication and willing to accommodate our needs. The pool is spectacular and we had a great time spending the afternoon relaxing there. The room had all the essentials and is cooled nicely with good air conditioning which is great in the summer. Also had a washer and dryer which was a great addition and allowed us to wash our clothes. Overall great experience! Would recommend! ,location

"This home is a wonderful respite from a hectic day of sightseeing and dealing with the traffic. The backyard garden and pool area feels as if you are in a tropical paradise, like Shangri-la. My cottage was very comfortable and even had extra products such as aloe vera lotion, which I needed for sunburn. I will most certainly stay here again if ever back in LA.",location
Perfect place for a get away!,location
Very convenient location for us to be able to visit with ease the parts of LA we love. Excellent space in the back to unwind in peace at the end of the day. We very much enjoyed our stay here.,location

"Myself and my 13 year old daughter had a wonderful time here.  The area is lovely, very pretty and peaceful.  The house itself is absolutely lovely, the pool and garden area really are an oasis and just what is needed after a long day out, also a lovely area when you want to have a lazy day in.  The outside grill is an added bonus, if you want to cook yourself, and hot tub is so relaxing!  We were made to feel very welcome, and any question we had was answered very quickly.  Would certainly stay here again - it's a gem!",location

You should also do yourself a favor and walk near by and grab fish tacos at the ""Best Fish Taco In Ensenada"".  The Cottage itself was great for a couple. Super comfortable bed, clean, and quiet.",location

Elizabeth's place was great. It was comfortable and clean. Great location with lots of restaurants and bars nearby. Nothing I can add that other reviewer's haven't already mentioned.

"This was a perfect place to stay for a weekend getaway. Even though we had a car, we never used it since there were so many great spaces to walk to. The neighborhood block was quiet and charming, while major entertainment destinations were within a 5-10 minute walk. The cottage was small but suitable for two people, especially since we spent most of our time exploring the area. The backyard was gorgeous and the pool & seating area were quite tranquil. Although the pool was advertised as heated, the water was too cold to get in, even on a hot 95 degree day. Check in/Check out was very easy and we had everything we needed, including extra towels and sundries. Thanks for everything, Elizabeth!",location
"Elizabeth's place was beyond! We stayed in early October, it was  90 degrees in LA, and a dip in the pool was the perfect reprieve from the heat! Our cottage was sparkling clean and stocked with sundries. We enjoyed the jacuzzi at night. And it was walking distance to some pretty great local spots (important for a New Yorker)! :D",clean
Beautiful spot with good restaurants nearby.,location

"What a great spot! Centrally located, privacy if you want it, but super friendly host (ask to see his pottery). Kick back yard, view of city lights. My favorite of all. ",location
"This was exactly what we needed for a couple days getaway, and we couldn't be happier. Check-in communication was a breeze, we never felt disturbed or observed, and the back yard / pool was perfect. It's beautifully maintained, and even though the neighbors and city is around you it feels secluded and private. The bungalow itself is cozy as advertised, but it fits every need and is more than enough room for two to be comfortable.<br/>The only less than glowing comment I'd make isn't about the home or renters... street parking is generally plentiful, but two nights a week one whole side is deemed a no parking area for cleaning, and that goes for all of the surrounding streets too. If you return late at night (on those nights) be prepared to park far away and walk walk walk.<br/>We'll be back!",location
"I highly recommend staying at Sarah's stylish and cozy little studio right in Los Feliz. Super close to everything you could want, and for a reasonable price you have your own private studio, with an actual kitchen. Spotlessly clean, comfy bed, great shower, and while I never actually met Sarah in person, she provided me with very thorough check-in instructions, in addition to tips for staying in the area. I prefer to stay in Los Feliz when I come to LA, and I would certainly stay at Sarah's place again! All around, an excellent experience.",clean
"Jon was a wonderful host.  We contacted him the same day, and he responded to us very quickly.  While we were there, he was very helpful getting us in, and was quick to answer any questions we had while we were there.<br/><br/>The room was very comfortable, as was the bed.<br/>It was around 90 F while we were there, hot for us, and the Air Conditioning worked well : )<br/><br/>The backyard was nice, I lied in the hammock under the lemon tree, out of the sun.  A lemon fell on me was I was falling into a nap.  Tough life!<br/><br/>Highly recommend Jon's place.<br/><br/>It was a 5-10 minute walk to pick up some food nearby.  Reggie's was great.",location

Sarah is so sweet! location was beautiful,location
"Good place for staying in LA. If you're traveling all day, it's perfect. If you plan to stay whole day at home, it could be hot in summer. <br/>Otherwise, clean and cute place in quiet area. Free parking lot is great advantage. <br/>Sarah is very good host. She helped a lot to us during our stay. I definitely recommend her :)",clean
"Location was excellent, near stores and shops and central to many destinations. Onsite parking seemed secure and was very accessible. Walls are a little thin so upstairs resident can be heard. Room has all expected amenities for kitchen and bath.  Ceiling fan and a box fan were provided. We came on a hot weekend and an extra fan would be nice. We had some issues with the TV but that was the fault of the prior guest. ",clean
"Clean, convenient, well-stocked, and in wonderful neighborhood. Sarah was a communicative and easygoing host. Upstairs neighbor is a little heavy-footed and lack of AC means keeping the windows open onto a fairly busy parking lot in the summer--not a problem for us, but simply something for more sensitive sleepers to be aware of! Otherwise no complaints at all.",clean
Fantastic spot in Los Feliz. Everything you need to enjoy Los Angeles. The neighborhood is safe & quiet with nearby stores & restaurants.,location
"We stayed in the studio for 4 nights during a long vacation all over California. As noted, the unit is in a great location in Los Feliz.  We found the area to be very charming and walkable, a real plus after all the driving that's required to see the sights in LA. Also, we took the Dash bus ($ .50 !) to the Griffith Observatory instead of trying to find parking up there. The stop is just 2 blocks from the unit. <br/><br/>The kitchen was well appointed with dishes, pots, utensils, stove, micro, and toaster. We cooked breakfast every day and there was nothing we needed to prepare our food that wasn't there. There's salt and pepper - essential but often missing in AirBnbs! - other seasonings, some coffee and lots of tea, and a wide assortment of snacky foods that seemed to have been left behind by other guests and kindly not tossed by the host. We added a bit to the collection!<br/><br/>Bed was comfy and thoughtfully set up with small bedside tables and lamps on both sides as seen in the photos. Bathroom is very large and there's even an empty dresser in there if you're staying a while and want to unpack. Sofa is newer and also very comfortable. Lots of TV channel/app options if you're crazy enough to hang out and watch TV when you could be out exploring Los Angeles! Plenty of outlets although on one side of the bed there's no unused/available plug.  <br/><br/>There were a few downsides here as well. Shower head is old and sprays a weird ring of water, and it takes a LOT of elbow grease to divert the water from the tub faucet.  Unit is quite a bit smaller than we expected from the photos. And, this is a basement unit. The windows are right at ground level, so we kept them closed and locked at night and whenever we were out, so we weren't able to enjoy the fresh air as much as we would have liked. Also, the entry door is just at the top of the stairs next to the unit and to close it from the outside you SLAM it really hard, so whenever someone is exiting the building at the back, you're going to know it!<br/><br/>One other note: The reserved parking spot at the back is super convenient, much closer to the unit entry door then parking on Los Feliz Blvd , and highly recommended if you have a compact car. We had a Ford Fiesta (tiny!) and it barely cleared the parking thruway when pulled all the way in to the spot.",location
"Sarah's place is cute and in the perfect location! Walking distance from a natural foods store, grocery store, and plenty of places to eat. It's also reasonably priced.<br/>My only caveat, especially if you are a woman staying alone, is that the entrance is in the back of the building, off the parking lot. The area is generally safe but your feelings on this may vary.<br/>Thanks!",location
"Sarahâs home is clean, bright and close to everything. I walked to most places in Los Feliz because it was so easy. The amenities covered all bases and if I ever return to Los Feliz I would stay here again! Highly recommend!",clean
Perfect place in the perfect location! The place was bigger than we expected and had everything we needed.,location
Sarah's place is perfect for a weekend and the location is awesome!,location
"Sarahâs place was exactly as described and served as a great base to explore LA from. I was able to go on runs in Griffith Park easily, and the proximity to coffee shops, restaurants, and groceries was convenient.",location
"Sarah's place is wonderful ! I lived there for a month and it was a lovely experience. Walkable to everything on Hillhurst and Vermont, and to trails in Griffith Park & probably the Greek Theater too. The space works beautifully for one person for an extended stay. Comfortable, stylish, simple. Sarah is an excellent communicator and caring host. Thanks so much !",location
Sarah's place is in a great location in Los Feliz.  It is only a 2 minute walk to the local Albertson's and a 3 minute walk to lots of restaurants and shops.  The bathroom is a lot bigger than I expected.  I enjoyed my time staying at her place.,location
"Sarah was literally one of the best  host I have ever visited. Her flat was perfect - spotlessly clean, literally all kitchen and bathroom equipment what you can imagine. Location was really nice and friendly, 15 min walk from subway. Communication with sarah was quick and all her instructions were clear. she was always on the phone prepared to help us with whatever we needed. Even we didnt meet in person I think she is really nice person and perfect host!!!",clean
"Everything is great. The place is cute, clean, spacious and has complete necessity for daily life. The basement always cool even during LA summer heat. It is also very close to the supermarket and my two fave parks Barnsdall and Griffith. On my first day, there was slight problem but Sarah resolved it quick and pleasant. Overall its been an amazing stay with such amazing host. Thank you very much :)",clean
Sarahâs apartment is adorable and the location is fantastic. I highly recommend this terrific Airbnb.,location
"Sarah's at Los Feliz is a perfect place to explore L.A. I love this neighborhood, close to Griffith Park (it can't be closer, indeed) at two of the streets with more vibes in the city (Vermont and Hillhurst). You can go walking to have a brunch or dinner, the cinema or shopping. Then, you have public transport to connect to every part of the city. <br/><br/>Besides, the apartment is cozy, comfortable, clean... as you can see in the pics. Don't hesitate, it's your place to stay and enjoy the city",location
"Sarahâs home is beautiful and perfectly located in Los Feliz. Everything was smooth, her space is clean, and so so cute. Would happily stay there again on our next trip.",clean
"I stayed in Sarah's Los Feliz studio while on assignment as a travel nurse in LA for about 20 weeks from December-April. I cannot say enough about the location of this studio. It is right in the heart of the Los Feliz neighborhood and there are so many restaurants, stores, and coffee shops within walking distance. I absolutely fell in love with the area and became a regular at many of the local spots. I also loved that I had the ability to walk to the grocery store from Sarah's place. The studio itself is cute and accurately pictured. It is definitely a small space but was perfect for me long term on my own, and was manageable with more than one person when my sister came to visit for a weekend. The building that the studio is in is older so obviously the studio is as well. I didn't find this to be an issue and I honestly thought that the building was gorgeous and had a lot of character. I especially loved the lush courtyard in the front of the building. Before I arrived I was initially concerned that the unit does not have air conditioning, but with the ceiling fan and the ability to open a window the warmer days in the spring were not an issue a all. There is also heating in the unit for colder days which was nice. I was also thankful to have a designated parking spot so that I didn't have to worry about finding street parking. I would say the only issue was receiving mail at the studio during my long term stay. There were a couple occasions where my packages were stolen or misplaced from the front of the building, but this would most likely not be an issue for a short stay and I NEVER felt unsafe living there. Sarah was an excellent host and responded within minutes every single time I reached out to her. I would highly recommend this stay for anyone visiting LA long or short term. I have only been gone a few days and I already miss it!",location
Great neighborhood. Unit is bright and comfortable. Great bathroom. Wonderful place to stay.,location
"My husband and I truly enjoyed our stay.  We were there for about a month and Sarah was very communicative, accommodating and helpful.  The area is great!  So many nice places within walking distance.  There's a Blue Bottle coffee (best coffee worth the wait), a health food store, Albertson's, Yuca's (really great burritos from the cutest little shack) and Jeni's (the best ice cream in the world) all right down the street.  <br/>Sarah's place has a full kitchen with plenty of plates and utensils and cookware plus some basic seasonings.  <br/>There is also a wall heater that was remarkably efficient in taking on the slight morning chill.<br/>The bathroom is nice with a large square tub and a lot of space for your things.<br/>Perfect place for 1-2 people for an extended stay, definitely consider Sarah's place next time you find yourself in LA!",location
"Amazing location! Walking distance to some of the best of central LA. So close to Griffith Park as well, this apartment is epically placed! <br/>The apartment itself is adorable, but it is a basement style place, so not the best lighting/air circulation, but there are fans. <br/>Basically, an amazing spot to explore la la land..!",location
"GREAT location but this unit needs to be fixed up before anyone else stays there.  The bed sheets were ripped upon arrival, the shower curtain was moldy, the couch and towels had mysterious stains, the floors were dirty, and there were mouse traps everywhere.  Additionally, the wifi is SUPER slow (upload speed of .1 mbps and a download speed of 10 mbps). Iâd recommend this place if the owner does a deep clean and a lot of fix-ups.",clean
"My partner and I stayed in Sarahâs studio for a month this fall and it was HEAVEN. Location could not be betterâhealth food and regular grocery stores just around the corner, loads of great restaurants within minutes, comfortable walk to Silver Lake area. Los Feliz is incredibly pleasant and adorable. The studio is so cozy and had everything we needed. Easy parking. Great big bathtub which we love. Enough storage and easy to keep tidy. Sarah was accommodating and communicative throughout our stay. This was an amazing home for us and we would have stayed longer if we could have! Thanks again, Sarah!",location
"Sarah's place is absolutely perfect for any type of stay. The place is quiet, clean, and very cute. The location of the apartment is the most ideal. You get the best of both worlds being close to the city and close to awesome hiking trails and parks. Sarah was super friendly and responded very fast whenever I reached out. She is an excellent host! Thanks so much for letting stay here Sarah!",location
Courtyard area lovely area and great location!!,location
Elizabeth's place is just as advertised and she offers recommendations for the neighborhood. The amenities were wonderful and it was easy to communicate with her. I definitely recommend Elizabeth as a host and this property. ,host
We were in LA for a getaway weekend and really enjoyed our stay here. There are cool shops and restaurants around the neighborhood and the place was exactly as described. The best part without a doubt is the pool for us to relax in when we felt like just taking it easy. Would definitely consider staying here again next time weâre in town!,location
The best part of Williamâs place is the jacuzzi in the yard. He allowed us to use them even when we checked in late because of our tight schedule. Very relaxing after a long day.,location
William was a great host! He really helped us out last minute and we had a lovely stay. His space is small but comfortable and has everything you need for a good sleep. Great location and beautiful backyard space.,location

Amazing place. The oasis is beautiful. The hot tub is amazing. They have two beautiful cats that roam around the back yard and are very friendly. Plenty of street parking. Close to everything. Awesome place!,location
"You won't find a better value in LA. The hosts are 100% non-intrusive but always a quick text away. Location is 15 min drive from everything and was perfect. Having a in room washer and dryer was incredibly handy.  Amazing place, quiet, secure and overall worth every penny.",price
"This cozy cottage is well located in a great neighbourhood. Easy walk to many great places to explore and many cafes and restaurants.  Easy to get to major freeways and other parts of LA by car.  If the weather is nice and you have some down time the outdoor space is beautiful, relaxing and the pool and hot tub are a real bonus.",location

Wonderful pool space.,location
"We enjoyed our stay at Los Felis. Location wise it was perfect, parking was plentiful and the garden is just spectacular. We loved chilling in the jacuzzi after spending all day exploring.<br/><br/>The neighbourhood is quiet and the garden felt private. In comparison to the garden the cottage felt worn out and it could do with a little renovation. Having said that there was plenty of useful amenities including a great coffee machine and phone chargers.",location
Great place! The garden is amazing. The room has everything needed. Communication with William was easy and very friendly. Thank you again for having us.,clean
"What a great location.  Don't really know where to start.   The picture of a flower in a botanical book is information; its place  ends with our knowledge. But in pure art it is a personal communication,  Wylie, A. (2016). This places because of its privacy compared to Hotels,  where pool areas have other guests,  allow you to create an oasis in the hustle butsle of the city.  Your own personal oasis that gives more than sight but an opportunity to listen to your own heartbeat. A chance to Communicate with self. And ofcourse it is also a place to have fun with the fam and create some cool memories.",location
"Very cute little bungalow. Cozy and private. The pool and jacuzzi was amazing and definitely the best part of this place. I was bummed out because during one day of my stay, there were gardeners renovating the yard/pool area so I was unable to enjoy the pool that day and I wished the host would have given me heads up about it. The host was nice enough to refund me a little money without me asking. Overall it is a great place, in a great area and I would definitely stay again. The icing on the cake is the host has a couple of gorgeous cats and I enjoyed the cats company in the pool area!",location
William was extremely easy to communicate with and quick with responding. In walking distance to everything you need and parking was super easy. Thank you!,location
"What an amazing & relaxing place, perfect after a long day driving through hectic LA traffic & on our feet at Universal studios. The space is small but has everything you could possibly need for a great nightâs sleep. The backyard amenities will have you feeling like youâre on a tropical vacation. We made sure to take full advantage of the pool & hot tub and relaxed in the yard with our morning coffee. Location is very convenient, close to lots of trendy restaurants & cafes. Couldnât have asked for a better place to stay!",location

"I loved staying here! Jon was always reachable via message even though I didn't meet him until the last day. The room was very clean and comfortable, and it was great having my own bathroom and separate door to come and go as I pleased. The garden was beautiful and we were lucky enough to be there on the 4th of July, so we had an amazing view of the fireworks at Dodgers Stadium and over the city. The area is fantastic, and within walking distance of great restaurants and shops which is rare for LA! Definitely hope to stay here again on my next visit!",location

It's just off the side of a fun and eclectic house in a quiet, sloping street in Echo Park. You're minutes from dozens of fantastic restaurants, bars, and coffee shops â yet the neighborhood is impressively quiet (almost silent!) all day long. The backyard firepit is great, the space is large, and it has a really amazing view of the skyline.<br/><br/>During our stay, Jon was knee-deep in a big repainting of the house in the middle of a pretty nutty heatwave. Despite all of that, his super chill demeanor, total friendliness, and swift response to any need was perfect and really appreciated.<br/><br/>If you need a comfortable, low-key stay in an otherwise happening area of LA, this is an awesome option.",location

"From our arrival we knew it was something special.  Checking in we were offered a glass of wine at the desk, next taken to our room via golf cart.  When we opened the door we immediately knew this was the best AirBnB selection we've made.  We are always a little nervous not knowing what you will get for your money...DONT WORRY AT ALL!! Those feeling actually left the moment we pulled into the resort.  <br/>A 5 Star resort and 5 STAR ROOM.  Monica, the host was easy to contact, she responded to one text within minutes.  The staff is there to pamper your every need.  The room spacious, clean and exceeded our expectations.  I could care less about bathrooms, but this one was exceptional...wife loved the tub...a child could swim laps in it.  <br/>We ate at Nelsons on the property...lobster tacos 2 thumbs up!  Beach towns are an easy drive and a beautiful drive as well.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to get away from it all and relax.  You could spend your entire time on the resort never leaving...hiking, spa, golf...just about anything you can think of.  A romantic get away or fun for the the family as well?   <br/>We will be back!",location

Plenty of towels were available as well as snacks and water. I even found a wine opener which came in handy when i had to pry off a soda bottle top, lol. Seems he has thought of everything one might need to have a pleasant stay, and I'd recommend his place to anyone! Sadly, I didn't get to use the pool or hot tub, mostly because I was just being lazy, but it looked lovely. Next time...",clean

"We had to leave early from a bad AirBnB experience and found Williamâs place. It was exactly what we hoped for. William was quick to respond and the place is as pretty as it looks in the photos, with the added bonus of being exceptionally quiet for a spot in LA. He also has two gorgeous cats that treat the backyard as a playground and honestly you could watch them run around in it for the entire day from the pool/hot tub. I would absolutely come back here again when Iâm in town!",location
"Awesome location, great space. Would stay again.",location
"William was a great host. We never met him but we had no problems at his place. It was in a perfect location. If youâre looking for a clean place to sleep while youâre in LA, this is a good option.",clean
"The listing doesn't say it, but the location is also within walking distance of L.A.'s light rail (Sunset and Vermont station), which we used exclusively for our entire L.A. visit. (We also walked / hiked to the Hollywood sign.) Great restaurants are also all around. The yard was our favorite aspect of this property. Coming from cold Seattle, it was really nice to soak in the hot tub each morning and have breakfast at the table / chairs in the backyard.",location
Great little place! The neighborhood is awesome and the outdoor space is so quiet!,location
"Parking availability is really the only issue, but you will find this to be a frequent problem most everywhere.",location
"Bed clean & very comfortable. Extra pillows a very nice touch.<br/>Coffee maker works well, and coffee delicious. Grounds very lovely.",clean
"Great location, the weather didnât allow us to enjoy the pool but would definitely come back",location
"Williamâs place is very comfortable, has a great outdoor area with pool and hot tub, and was in a great neighborhood. All the basics were checked, but this place was one of the most comfortable places weâve stayed. The bed was awesome, and there were multiple types of pillows to choose from. Very nice place to stay if you donât need a full kitchen. We would stay here again and again.",location
"This location is terrific. It's a vibrant area. I loved walking to restaurants recommended by the host. Street parking was easy. The property is beautiful. I didn't use the pool, but might have if it had been warmer.",location
"Great location, this cosy place has everything you need for a lovely stay in L.A. Very nice outdoors area with pool - which I did not get to use due to the weather, but would love to come back. Very clean place, and everything exactly as described and promised. Would recommend to anyone needing a place to stay in L.A.",clean
My daughter stopped in LA for a few days on route to Australia.   Booking this location for her was very easy.  William responded to inquiries very quickly and was able to accommodate a few requests that eased my worries as she was travelling alone.  Directions and checkin details were easy to follow and accurate.  Accommodations were as expected. My daughter loved the location.  The cats were an added bonus.  My daughter had nothing but positive things to say about her stay.  No negatives at all.,location
"Luscious private (host really respects your privacy) outdoor space. This really canât hold more than 2 people and donât being a lot of luggage. Itâs an average sized bedroom, period. A bathroom with an old vanity with things like used Vaseline in it :-( and not anywhere to really put things. But it was clean, has a washer dryer, the host is nice and super responsive, and itâs a great location to use just to crash and enjoy the outdoor spaces which are very very well taken care of and beautiful",location
Nice location and beautiful yard!,location
"A great location, and clean comfortable bed. The outside space really made this experience special. Easy access to everything and great local suggestions, we had several meals at eateries suggested by the host and all were fantastic!",clean
"It was cold and rainy during my stay and the heater was not working.  I mentioned this to the host and he said he didn't know how to fix it.  He gave me a space heater to use (and he responded right away, which was great!) but I had to plug and unplug from bathroom to one side of the bed to the other any time I moved around.  It was kind of a pain and still really cold.  I know this is a rarity for LA but it would have been nice to have the heat working.  It was hard to sleep and function without it.  If it was warmer, the yard and pool is really great.  For those traveling in the Summer and wanting a great area and nice, inexpensive place to stay it's fine as if you can be outside in that yard the whole time it's worth it.  For colder months, until the heater is fixed, I'd say stay away.",clean
Great little place in Los Feliz. Would stay here again.,location
The cottage is in a great location walking distance to many things. The backyard was beautiful and we enjoyed our stay!,location
Quiet & beautiful neighborhood. Nice pool and hot tub. Easy walking distance to great restaurants and bars.,location
Great place! Loved the room and the location is perfect,location
We enjoyed staying at Williamsâs place. The location couldnât be better. The bed was also extra comfy. It was a bit colder when we were in LA so didnât take full advantage of the backyard but it was beautiful. It is a smaller space but it has everything that you need. We would recommend staying there.,location
Fantastic central location allowing easy access to all surrounding tourist venues!! Lovely and clean little cottage with a beautiful back garden. <br/>Thank you for having usð,location
"Best location, best backyard!",location
"The room was perfect. Incredible location for exploring the neighborhood, clean, quiet. Communication with Jesse was super easy and he was wonderful and flexible when we wanted to extend the stay an extra day. The only thing I wish was that we'd had more time to relax in that hammock beneath the lemon tree and soak in the skyline views...next time!",location
Everything went fine at Jon and Jesse's place. It is a cosy room where we've found everything we needed. We loved the view on Downtown LA from the garden during sunrise!,location
"The house is perfectly located in the Echo Park neighborhood. Walking distance from everything this part of town has to offer (restaurants, bars, shops, live music,..). The room is clean and cosy. I loved the patio, perfect to chill, read a book or simply enjoy the view. Jon has been a perfect host from day one until the day I left. Very helpful and easy to reach.",location
My husband and I cannot recommend Jonâs place enough! Jon was a fabulous host and very welcoming. His space was fresh and very cozy. It had everything you needed.

"Great location, perfect for my needs. Jon is thoughtful and communicative.",location
"Jon is an excellent host. He is quick to respond, and comprehensively so. He went so far as to leave an umbrella for us when it was raining. The garden is beautiful; it's lovely to sit out in it in the late afternoon. The studio is attached to Jon's house. The space is utilised smartly, but it is small. My partner and I were kind of living on top of each other. I think it's ideal for a solo traveller. It has all the amenities that you'd want, too.",location
"Very nice studio - small but comfortable and clean. Lots of restaurants, cafes and shops within walking distance.",location
"Great value.  The location was great for me as I was visiting my sister in Echo Park.  Great view of downtown. <br/><br/>The property is very nice and has space with a hammock and a fire pit.  The unit we stayed in was small, but the right size for our needs.  It packed in a small kitchen which was a nice touch.<br/><br/>Overall very satisfied!",location

"This is a great gem!<br/><br/>The pool house was great, very clean and tidy, with almost everything you need (only missing an oven, they had a microwave though). <br/><br/>The pool and its lounge area are so nice and peaceful to relax in/next to, with great pool furniture. <br/><br/>I highly recommend this place.",clean
"OMG, this backyard. Dreamy is an understatement. Hot tub, little pool with waterfalls, tons of outdoor seating and lounging... room was small but bed is comfortable. No kitchen but microwave, toaster, mini fridge, and Keurig in the closet. Walkable to everything in Los Feliz and Silverlake. And again, i would die for this backyard â it truly is an oasis.",location
Nice and clean cottage for our brief stay,clean
"Lovely guest cottage with an amazing outdoor space. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at William âs cottage. The cottage is small- just one room but that was not a problem for us. <br/>The bed was extremely comfortable and I slept better than ever. There is a step into the cottage and two small steps into the bathroom. <br/>He gave us space and we only saw him for a moment, but if we needed him he would be there. <br/>Totally recommend!!",location

This cute space is perfectly located and has everything you need. The backyard is beautiful too!,location
"Slightly smaller than I expected (there's a chance the size was mentioned, I admit to scanning) but very well organized and centrally located. LOVED the ease of check in.

Our first time staying in LA and we chose Williams place. Such a relaxing place to stay after a day of exploring. Also the two cats are cute and very friendly.,location
Great place to stay and be close to all cool things L.A.,location
"This is what I call âLush Lifeâ!!<br/>We loved our stay at Williams Poolhouse. It was really clean with comfortable beds. The garden was impressive and absolutely beautiful! We had good weather, so we jumped into the pool every day. ð<br/>It was easy to get a quick reply on any questions we had. <br/>Thank you William for a great stay! Weâll be back!",clean

Great weekend at Terranea.  The location was awesome and the service was 5 star :),location
Terranea Resort is gorgeous and I would highly recommend.  The casita's are very nicely furnished and I would like would stay again.,location
Wonderful and secluded Casita at Terranea. She was very expedient with last minute arrangements.,location
"Unit was falsely advertised as a king suite with a king bed and single bed when itâs not a suite and is the same as a standard hotel room per the hotel. Owner removed reference to suite and second bed upon getting Air B&B  complaint.  The room suffers from significant wear and tear, the carpet is worn and dirty, the linens were not fresh, the TV armoire door was literally falling off upon opening, the AC control was also hanging loose onto wall, the paint and fixtures is frayed.  I can go on.  The room needs a major overhaul.  The room is fairly small and leaves little room to navigate.  Other than the king bed, thereâs a small desk and small chair/ottoman and very little space.  The bathroom takes up a sizeable portion of the overall square footage of the room and leaves you little room elsewhere.  The balcony is fine but the ocean is about a 1/4 mile away and thereâs only a view of the sea (not beach) that is partially obstructed by buildings and trees.  The room is next to the parking lot and a long walk to restaurants, lobby etc.  I would recommend booking a room with the hotel even if it cost more given the foregoing and the location/condition.",clean
"Cute, cozy spot in such a nice neighborhood",location
Jonâs place is quiet with a nice garden with fire pit<br/>Well located for shops and some<br/>great bars and hipster restaurants in Silverlake,location
"Jonâs space is perfect for a long weekend for a couple. The outdoor amenities cannot be beat, with the amazing view from the charming garden, and being within walking distance to a lot of great spots. Would highly recommend!",location

Such a cute and clean spot!! Was in LA for work and Jonâs charming house have me solace. Wish I had gotten to spend more time there!,clean
"The location is amazing, especially if you like the ability to walk to everything in echo park. Bonus points if you get tacos from the RiteAid parking lot. The space itself is cozy, super clean, very well decorated and quiet. Jon is friendly, respectful and available if you need anything -- otherwise he just goes about his own business in his home and out back in his pottery studio. I highly recommend this spot!",clean
"Great space. I've stayed in the hotel and this was a larger, nicer room. Private entrance. Didn't actually see anybody else in the casita. The grounds are beautiful. This is closest Casita to the hotel and amenities. Check-out was earlier than I had been told. 11 am not noon. But they were able to help. ",location
Monciaâs place is located at the beautiful Terranea resort. If you are looking for relaxing accommodations with a gorgeous  view and plenty of restaurants within walking distance look no further and book with Monica.,location

"The place is perfect for a vacation, staycation, or just getawaycation! <br/><br/>The room was very clean and well kept. The view from the balcony was lovely and the room just wraps coziness all around you! <br/>Itâs in a very well placed spot on the resort so youâre not to far out from the pool and main building but youâre just far enough that you feel like itâs just your own spot.<br/><br/>My wife and I wish we could have stayed longer but we definitely enjoyed the trip! <br/>Thank you for making such a lovely space!",location
Gorgeous resort and this unit was wonderfully situated on the property,location
Great location! And the terrace has a great ambiance! Loved the shower! And patio. Will return to Abalone cove present down the trail!,location
"Beth is a great host, and the accommodations are amazing.",location
"Great room, very baby friendly.  The location on the resort is perfect - it is the closest casita to the main resortâs pools but it is still private and quiet.  The small balcony has a partial ocean view too!  The Airbnb host is also super responsive to any queries! <br/><br/>The only downside is that though we paid a $50 daily resort fee, Terranea told us on check in that they will only perform housekeeping for the casitas once every 3 days (you cannot even request it) and every time we tried calling to order room service the line was busy/ didnât get picked up.   Basically treat it as an Airbnb rental without the hotel services.",location
Marvelous views. Clean modern interior. All the amenities of the resort are included.,location
Stunning views of Catalina Island!,location
Great location and value compared to what the hotel charges! Definitely worth it!,location
"We really enjoyed our stay, bed was comfortable, nice bathroom with separate bath and shower, beautiful view and sitting area.

"This place was absolutely beautiful. Our room was perfect, to just stepping outside and feeling like youâre in your own little world!",location
"Lovely back yard., which I was allowed to use and enjoy.  I found it to be quiet and serene, which was pleasant and welcomed.  The room itself is small and a bit cramped.  Bed and pillows were comfortable and I slept well each night.  Not a lot of storage for my stuff, so I had things laying out on the love seat the entire time.  Being a bit of a neat freak, this did not bring me joy.  Be aware that there is a step down into the casita and a step up into the bathroom, which could be a challenge for some.  No kitchen, but there is a mini fridge, microwave, toaster oven and a Keurig (coffee and condiments included) behind closed doors, which was a nice surprise!  No TV, radio or clocks, so you can escape from the rest if the world if youâd like.  Street parking could be a challenge, but your in the largest city in America, so it is to be expected.  Navigating the driveway incline and the access gate was somewhat sporty, especially with luggage in tow.  All in all I enjoyed my time at the Los Feliz Oasis and would happily stay here again.",location
"This cottage is in a great location and is very quiet. Being detached from the main house, it is very private. The room is small but comfortable. The large patio area has beautiful palm trees and views. (Warning: if you are prone to mosquito bites, be prepared, but that's nature.) The hot tub was nice, and the two cats who wander around are friendly. William was very responsive and helpful.",location

His backyard oasis with beautiful landscaping, pool and hot tub and multiple seating areas was very resort-like.",clean
This studio was perfect for a long weekend in LA!

This place is very simple. The bed is comfy. I think my all over stay would have been better if the weather was nice because the pool is amazing.

Marcy did everything to make my stay comfortable and relaxing.... Her space was light filled and airy.   I had my own sheltered environment and was greatly appreciated.  Thank you Marcy !,clean
"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay with Marcy, as both owner and home were wonderful. Marcy's space is bright, cozy, and serene, with a comfy bed, and a wide array of Fios cable channels. Her home is a quick walk to Lincoln and Abbot Kinney, or a short bike ride away from the beach.<br/><br/>The few conversations I had with Marcy made my stay especially worthwhile. They were interesting and though-provoking exchanges, and I appreciate her wisdom and insight. She's a very caring host who periodically checked in to make sure my stay was comfortable, and I would stay again in a heartbeat!",location
"We had a beautiful time in Venice, Marcy is a great host! We were really late but it was not an issue, we were warmly welcomed by Marcy with a bottle of wine and figs from her own garden. Location is perfect, close to everything, walking distance to shopping, beach and just 15 min from airport. Apartment is cozy, extremely clean, high celling and lots of windows make it super bright, it looks exactly as described. Marcy made our stay unforgettable, we will definitely stay at her home again once we visit LA.",clean

Very comfortable and well located apartment. Marcy is a gracious hostess. Don't miss a visit to the Mosaic Tile House just across the street! But beware...don't park in the alley or you may get a ticket. You can usually find a parking spot on the street.,location
Marcy is an outstanding host and a gracious human being. This secure backyard apartment is incredibly well-lit; filled with an abundance of natural light. The bed is very comfortable and is a perfect getaway for an individual or a couple. I highly recommend.,location
"Marcy is an amazing host and a caring / warm / friendly person, so keep it in mind when booking. As for the place itself, comfortable, VERY well illuminated, clean, and spacious. We had a great time driving around to Santa Monica and L.A., and found every night spent here relaxing, secure and refreshing.",clean
"Marcy was super communicative from start to finish, and made our stay warm and inviting. She greeted us with figs picked from her garden, and made sure we had everything we needed. Sometime i could hear her practicing music with her partners in the daytime and it is very beautiful and soothing. <br/><br/>The Venice location is close to Abbot Kinney and Marina del Rey, and a short drive to Santa Monica. The location is quiet and peaceful and has a constant breeze from the ocean keeping the unit cool without air conditioning. <br/><br/>I would recommend Marcy's place to all travelers<br/><br/>",location

Marci was a wonderful host and everything was very clean and comfortable. Joe and I really enjoyed our stay and would love to go back.,clean
"I stayed at Marcy's place for almost a week. She's a very sweet and lovely, open-minded and funny person. Communication was great and I felt safe at her flat (female travelling alone) not only because of the flat's location but also because of Marcy. The neighborhood is nice. Close to the beach, shops and sights. I used uber and public transport system and it worked great. The kitchen was fully furnished, big fridge, great coffee machine ;-), comfortable bed. The flat was very clean and it was quiet at night. Lots of space for clothes and a private entrance. Good air conditioning system. I will definitely come back! Absolutely loved it :)",clean

Marcy was quick with her communication responses and provided detailed information on how to easily find her place from all modes of transport.<br/>We did have a couple of things not working when we first arrived but Marcy made sure these were fixed straight away. <br/>The place is located a good 10-15min walk to Abbot Kinney and about 20-30min walk to Venice beach. There is a supermarket right next door which is very handy.<br/>Whilst it did not bother us, a note to light sleepers it is a bright house with no curtains so you are likely to rise early but more chance to pack more into the day ;-)",clean
"The apartment was exactly as pictured with all the amenities listed. It was clean, comfortable, and quiet. Marcy was a great host - making sure I was taken care of and seeing if there was anything I needed. The bikes were great to have and Marcy took care of any problems I had. Checking in and out were flexible which I appreciated, and overall I had a great experience. ",clean
The space was great! Such a great value! Marcy was so nice and was so easy to get in touch with; she gave great restaurant recommendations. I would definitely recommend this space to someone looking to stay in Venice.,location
"I and my wife stayed at Marcy's place for almost two weeks. We loved the stay and will definitely come back. The apartment is very nice, great location, comfortable and clean, it has a full kitchen and a lot of amenities. Parking was on premises and bikes were a great plus. We used them quite a lot around Venice Beach and all the way to Santa Monica. Marcy was a superb host. She is very kind and caring person. She greeted us cheerfully and took great care of us and our needs. We also loved chatting with her :-). Thank you Marcy!<br/><br/>A highly recommendable place to stay.<br/>",host
"Highly recommend! Bright, spacious, clean, great location. The description is accurate, including Marcy's helpfulness and warmth. It is a very open large studio, in a private area. It is walking distance to restaurants, and probably a 15 min walk to Abbot Kinney. Grocery store is nearby. The kitchen and shower were *clean* and nice, something I always wonder about. Plenty of natural light, private entrance off the alley. Thank you, Marcy!",clean
Marcy is very nice! Her place is tidy and comfortable. Very close to Santa Monica beach.,location
"Marcy is a fantastic host.  She has everything ready for you, the place is quiet and comfortable, and accurately represented in the photographs.  It is easy to get in and out of and comes with a private parking spot if you have a compact car.  If not, there is plenty of easy and available street parking.  Good natural light and in a great neighborhood.",location
Marcy booked us on short notice and was very helpful throughout our stay. The place was clean and as advertised. We enjoyed borrowing her bikes and riding around Venice.,clean

The pool area is incredible,location
We loved Williamâs place so much! The pool area was wonderful and the hot tub was heavenly (and working perfectly).,location
"One of my favorite places Iâve stayed in LA, the guest house is completely separate & has access to a truly amazing and beautifully designed courtyard. The host had great communication and the place was cozy & cool",location
Williamâs casita was absolutely perfect. The space was clean and perfectly situated with an adorable patio and beautiful pool. Had the best weekend getaway and looking forward to returning!,location

Great location for East Hollywood! Host was great and pictures and description match the outside perfectly. Would recommend to a friend.,location
"Williamâs space went beyond expectations. From the cozy room to the pool & spa, it was a perfect Oasis. I would definitely come back and recommend this listing for everyone. Also I love the 2 cats, the were pretty friendly.",location
"This little cottage was the perfect place to relax during a staycation! Iâm an LA native but was looking to crash somewhere with a pool for a few days. Williamâs home did not disappoint, it was perfect. <br/><br/>The cottage itself is detached from the main home, itâs cozy but perfect for my use. The main feature for me was the amazing backyard. The pool and spa were awesome and were ready to go as soon as I checked in. I would say the pool is about 4â-5âdeep? Not entirely sure but it was perfect for just hanging out and cooling off. Inside the cottage youâll find a queen sized bed, a washer/dryer combo which I thought was pretty cool, a mini fridge, microwave, and Keurig. The check-in/out process was also contactless if that matters to you, I felt like I was in a clean space too. Although itâs contactless, Williamâs communication throughout the stay was top notch. <br/><br/>I would definitely book Williamâs place again if the opportunity presented itself. Iâm glad I got to experience this little gem in Los Feliz.",location
"I stayed here with my twin 6-year olds for one day and evening, and it was the perfect place for a day at the pool with the kids, a little rest and relaxation, while being close to a hub of restaurants and hip neighborhood of Silverlake (not that we went out). But I live in LA, so it was a staycation for me and my kids, who loved shooting balls into the basketball hoop at the sparkling clean pool with soothing water falls cascading from the side wall. We also enjoyed chillaxing in the hot tub. Room is basic, but clean and with everything you need for patio dining. It's all about the outdoor oasis that takes you away from city life, at least for a day :) William was communicative and accommodating. Would recommend to friends coming to LA for a visit.",clean
"Jonâs place was a total dream oasis. It was so easy to scoot around the east side with ease from where we sat in silverlake. The garden and views were such a welcome sight after years of not living in LA. He was very available and communicative around any needs we had but tbh, everything was great and we mostly just got to chat. Would totally stay here again. Thanks so much for your hospitality!",location
A cute space in Echo Park! Within walking distance to some great restaurants and local coffee spots.,location

Central location with easy parking all day long, and he has all the necessities for soap, body wash, hair dryer, etc. The room is a tight fit all in one square and itâs attached to the house. Great host, great place, highly recommend!",location
"Johnâs place is clean, comfortable, and well-situated. As a solo business traveler, the place was the perfect size and included all the necessities for my 3-night stay! Street parking was not an issue, and he even let me check in a couple hours early. Highly recommended!",clean
"Johnâs place is in a great location (very walkable to restaurants, Echo Lake, etc.) and is so so cute. The living area is quaint and private and the backyard is the perfect place to unwind after a busy day. My boyfriend and I loved our stay here!",location
John was a great host and has an amazing place for a solo traveler! The studio was clean and has everything you would need. I loved the backyard with amazing views of la and relaxing setup in the back. The location of John's place is perfect for sight seeing la and a quick drive to most things depending on that traffic or time of day. He gave me some great local recommendation and quick responses. I would highly recommend John for future traveling to LA,location
"John is a wonderful host and his place is absolutely gorgeous. The room is cozy and has everything we needed for our stay. The location is great! We walked to tons of vegan restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and grocery stores. The bed is comfortable and having access to a washer/dryer was perfect since we decided to run around Echo Park a few mornings. I would absolutely recommend staying here and enjoying the view of downtown from the backyard.",location

"Beautiful, light and spacious studio apartment with an attentive host (thoughtfully provided me medicine to fight a cold).  I enjoyed my stay. If you want access to the Venice ""scene"" you might want to pick a place closer to it than this (its on the fringe of Venice) but Marcy provides two bicycles for anyone who wants to get down to the heart of Venice and the beach. If you want a comfortable and quiet place as your HQ for activities or business on the West side of LA, Marcy offers a great place to stay. ",location
Marcy is the best host ever! Always willing to help and a very pleasant person to deal with. <br/>The appartment is very light and cozy. A parking space at the territory. Close to Venice Beach and Santa Monica.,location

"We had such a great time in Venice!Marcy was always available and glad to share tips and recommendations with us. Chatting with her was nice and we got the chance to listen to her playing violin. Her studio was well-located to reach supermarkets, lively areas and streets. Unfortunately for us her bikes were stolen right after our arrival :( so we didn't have the chance to use them to reach easily and fast the beaches. The studio is bright, big, with many equipments and we appreciated the welcome package she had prepared for our first night. One point could be improved: the fridge was a bit noisy and the bed was big but the mattress not enough firm for us but it's only details and we will come back with pleasure!! She is a great host.",location

"Marcy's studio apartment was awesome. It is better than described. This studio is in a separate building in the back of property. Access is great in and out of the property. Marcy supplied me with a bicycle which was great for getting around and seeing all the attractions in Venice or Santa Monica. Walking distance to supermarkets, coffee shops, 7/11 convenience store. <br/>The unit is spotless and the bed is very comfortable. <br/>I will definitely return to Venice and stay with Martha.",clean
Really nice place; very clean and comfortable and great places to eat within walking distance. Marcy was super-helpful.,clean
"Clean, spacious room with everything you need for a getaway. Marcy was excellent at communicating, made sure that we had everything we needed, and was very friendly. The only slight con I can think of is that the place didn't have AC, which usually isn't an issue around the Venice area, and it is not listed on the amenities so it should be expected. Would definitely recommend. Great host and great room.",clean
"Perfect location, very cute set up, and really clean! Would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone.",clean

"Marcyâs place is perfect for a trip to Venice. Sheâs on the north side of Lincoln, so her neighborhood is a bit more quiet than those on the other side of Lincoln. The space is perfect for 1 or 2 travelers. Itâs bright, has a very comfortable bed, and all of the cooking supplies needed. Her place is about a 15 minute walk to Abbott Kinney and about 20 minutes to the beach. She also has a bike you can use to quickly get around. I also got a chance to talk to Marcy and Pearl quite a bit, they are awesome! Definitely book this place is youâre looking for a getaway in a great location in Venice with wonderful hospitality from Marcy.",location
"Another great stay at Marcy's place. This is the second visit for me and if i go back somewhere then it means its good! When i come to town I'm always on business but the proximity to great food, stores, the beach and Venice as a whole is a must for me. And this place has it with spades.",location
Marcy's place was great.  Close to the beach and close to the Santa Monica Airport where I was doing a trade show.  Marcy was very receptive and a great host.  The space was perfect after some long work days.  Will try to stay again if I am in that neck of the woods.,location
"Marcyâs property was perfect in every way. When we arrived, the property was really clean and Marcy made us feel so welcome, offering fantastic tips and advice for the area and local restaurants and tourist spots. We felt totally relaxed and Marcy was helpful with any questions we had! We couldnât rate this place highly enough. The area was ideal for wandering down to Venice Beach, shopping on Abbott Kinney and catching a bus for a short trip to Santa Monica!",clean
Amazing location with private parking. Great space as advertised. Wifi wasn't working when we stayed. No window coverings on many of the windows made it hard to chose when to wakeup.,location

She was available when necessary and very accommodating. I highly recommend.",host
"Marci is very kind  and ready to help with anything you need. The place is spacious, clean and bright although it might gets a bit warm on sunny days. It's a perfect base to visit Venice, just 10 minutes walk from Rose Avenue or Abbott Kinney and 20 minutes walk to the beach. Thanks Marci!",location
The place was open and comfortable with a lot of natural light and a cute lofted meditation space. The mattress is on the softer side; the kitchen had everything we needed and was thoughtfully stocked with snacks/tea/coffee. Marcy was very friendly and a great host.,location
Great host!,host
"Marcy is a very nice and kind host. She can give many hints and tips about the neighborhood. And she also speaks fluently French.<br/>The apartment of Marcy is very nice, quiet, bright and very clean.<br/>It has a private parking space but it is a bit tricky backing in the place especially with a bigger car.<br/>Many restaurants and shops very close.<br/>I recommend the place.",clean
"This was a mixed bag.  The space is fine, certainly not luxurious and there were a few bugs but it's pretty large and the bed was comfortable.  But I wouldn't stay there again. Communication and privacy were our main issues.  Marcy forgot we were coming despite communication beforehand, so forgot to leave the back gate open for us.  It was pretty confusing - luckily I was able to reach her by phone and she was able to give us instructions to get in, but it was a frustrating start.  And then she came to check on us several times when we were there in a way we found a bit overbearing - first time was around midnight on our night of arrival, we came in the back gate after going out and she was dropping off a note for us (if we'd been asleep inside I would have been totally freaked out), and then she came by a few more times to check in.  I'm sure it was meant to be nice, but if you value privacy, not the best spot.  And the internet was super slow.  It's fairly cheap, and a decent location walkable to things in Venice.  But if you're staying alone, be aware that your entrance is in a back alley and I wouldn't walk alone there at night.  It's very noisy and the apartment gets very bright in the morning so bring ear plugs and eye mask. There's only one key to the back gate, so if you're staying with someone and you are going out separately, you'll have to call each other to be let back in.",location
"Marcy is a gracious and helpful hostess. She always ready to sort out whatever you need. The house is large and well equipped, and the neighborhood is quiet. We really appreciated our time there (30 days) and we suggest this place for everybody!",location
Marcy is an AMAZING host! Went above and beyond to make her guest feel comfortable and welcomed. She was great with communication and very accommodating to all our needs. I would highly recommend booking with Marcy she always goes above and beyond to ensure her guest is completely satisfied. Thank you Marcy!!  ,host
"Excellent Airbnb - clean, cool and airy. Everything you need for a pleasant visit - iron, ironing board, hair dryer, kettle (for those essential cups of tea) etc. Situated in nice, safe area. Marcy was very welcoming and friendly. Hope to visit again on my next trip to LA.",clean
"Marcy is a wonderful host, and her guest house is terrific. She was highly communicative and extremely accommodating from end to end (I showed up late at night, and was able to stow my bags for one more day at the beach after check out), and sheâs  the exact picture of the host I would look for in Venice. The place was perfect (certainly for one or a couple) in terms of space, gets a nice breeze in and was immaculate, and has everything you needâthe bike being especially useful. True it is near a major cross-street in Lincoln Blvd, but having several shops and good choices for food that close by proved convenient, and the fastest way to the boardwalk and beach goes through a beautiful neighborhood and Abbott Kinney or past all the good options on Rose. Would feel lucky to come out and stay here again! Thanks so much Marcy!",location
"Marcy's place is a wonderful escape from the busy streets of LA. She's an excellent host â checked in on me and responded to all messages quickly. The apartment is near lots of great local cafes and equipped with a very comfy bed, spacious living area and kitchen essentials. There's even parking too! â I drive a Jeep and I'm a terrible parallel parker so I opted for street parking and never had a problem finding a spot on nearby streets. Overall: great host, great place, would recommend!",location

"Wonderful neighborhood and great accommodations! The owners will not use the outdoor space, including pool and hot tub, while there are Airbnb guests. The space was exactly as described and the place was sparkling clean even with a day-of booking request. Amazing communication and great COVID cleaning protocols from their cleaners.",clean
"Nice, clean, and quiet cottage! Poolside gets GREAT sunshine for a little tanning. Enjoyed the jacuzzi at night time. Had a question for William and he instantly answered. Definitely will look into booking here again next time Iâm in the area!",clean
Great place! The pool and hot tub are amazing! In an amazing location as well.,location
"The room itself is pretty plain and straightforward, but the âoasisâ is where itâs at! Loved the whole backyard set up with pool, spa and fireplace. Close proximity to restaurants, coffee, etc. Easy street parking.",location
"Really enjoyed this stay! Even though our California weekend was cloudy, relaxing by the pool & hot tub was still wonderful! William was very quick to respond. Highly recommend!",location
We had a great time enjoying the pool and hot tub. William was a responsive host and I am definitely considering another stay in the future,location
"This was one of my favorite Airbnbs I've stayed in yet. It looks exactly as pictured. It was a very comfortable stay in a great part of Los Angeles. The guest house is very cozy, the hot tub and music were very easy to operate, and I felt like I had a lot of privacy while I was there. This was a very great value for the price!",location
I really enjoyed William's place. It was super clean and had a nice outdoor area.,clean
Oasis indeed! A really unique spa-like environment in a sweet tree-line family neighborhood. The room and bathroom is small but adequate. The outdoor terraced lounge area is lovely and very private. Highly recommended,location
"A literal oasis. Perfect backyard pool area. We had the guest house and backyard to ourselves, communication was great, and everything was clean and well-supplied. Quiet, safe neighborhood close to everything. Canât wait to stay here again!",location
Great location and William is quick to respond.,location
"This is an awesome airbnb. It was close to everything I wanted to go to and the bed was extremely comfortable!  Hanging out in the landscaped backyard was great for morning coffee/breakfast and then in the evening as well.  William is a great host and communicated quickly. The neighborhood is very quiet, I was surprised at the lack of noise in LA. I did not rent a car so I cannot speak to parking but it seemed as if there were street spaces available as I came and went to the residence. Five stars!",location
Lovely place to stay! <br/>Beautiful outside area!,location
"As I read through the prior reviews, I am torn about how I should communicate my thoughts about my stay.  I would say that, on the one hand, the neighborhood is beautiful, the location is accessible to great areas of Los Angeles, and the parking is very easy, safe, and free.  The host is very responsive and there was never anything I was lacking.  The value is also great. And the pool and spa are spectacular, which is really the biggest plus when it's so hot in LA.  On the other hand, I did experience some mixed feelings about the quality and appearance of the towels, sheets, pillows, and other appointments of the place.  One of the sheets was torn, the comforter cover did not look clean, I did not personally like the pillows (though other guests have raved about them), and the towels were worn, mismatched, and looked like they were not clean.  The bathmat appeared not to have been washed during the last 20 stays!  I know other hosts who replace all of these items every few months.  At TJ Maxx or other such places, you can get towels, washcloths and bathmats for $10 each, so I would really encourage the host to consider this.  So, this is the reason why I could not go as far as the other guests did with the raves, but the place is really a great find and I want to make sure I show some love for it - I hope I have.",location
"The place was beautiful and in such a great, walkable location. Loved atrium for dinner and little doms.",location
An amazing stay with a beautiful pool space. Felt incredibly private and we had the pool and jacuzzi to ourselves. Highly recommend!,location
Great spot. Itâs got all you need for a short stay near the downtown LA area. Jacuzzi and pool are great. Bed is super comfortable and thereâs even a washer dryer for long term stays. Nice A/C. Good communication with owner!,location
"As stated in other reviews, this is a great spot. The pool and hot tub are excellent. There are also two or three nice seating areas in the backyard perfect for enjoying a meal or drinks. I would recommend bringing bug spray but that's to be expected in an outdoor area w/ water, lush plants etc. Inside was as pictured -- bed was nice and even the futon surprisingly comfortable.",location
Williams place was amazing! We enjoyed the pool and spa after being out all day enjoying our little mini vacation. The bed was super comfortable as well as the pillows. The communication was quick and easy when I had any questions and parking was easy to find! Definitely recommend and would come back here again!,location
The pool is beautiful. I enjoyed my stay,location

William was very flexible and communicative throughout our stay. We loved the neighborhood and the pool house was the perfect size for my boyfriend and I. We also enjoyed being able to eat breakfast in the courtyard by the pool.,location
Clean and tidy studio with a gorgeous backyard. Perfect location in a quiet neighborhood.,location
"This place is totally awesome and value for money, having a swimming pool and jacuzzi all to yourself, has a lot of space and sitting areas. Itâs clean and he super ORGANIZED.<br/>I will SURELY go back.",clean
"The yard/amenities are fabulous, the listing could be doubled for this aloneâthere is a gorgeous, spacious outdoor area with private use of pool/hottub. Room was small but comfortable. Location is walkable to many restaurants/amentities. Street parking was no issue. Great airbnb experience.",location
"Williamâs place is fantastic! <br/><br/>Itâs a very nice, safe, and quiet street in a centrally located part of town. <br/><br/>The street parking was very easy and checking in was a breeze. William was reachable and we had no problems. <br/><br/>The hot tub and pool were fantastic after a long day. They both felt very private as no one was outside when we were there.  <br/><br/>The bed and futon (pull out bed) weâre both comfy and the inside of the guest house were clean. <br/><br/>Itâs on smaller side as described but was just enough for my partner and I. We were very cozy, and again it was very quiet. <br/><br/>The cats on the property are beautiful! They were much to busy with their cat things to be bothered we us, but it was a delight to see them. <br/><br/>I would stay here again and would recommend to anyone.",location
Great place - booked it for the yard and it didn't disappoint!!!! Note that there's no TV but we didn't see that as any problem.,clean

Great location and a nice spot!,location
"We had a fantastic stay at John's place. The room was as described and the outdoor space is incredible. As mentioned, though parking is not included there were many available spaces on the street. Check-in was a breeze with the provided instructions and John was very quick to answer any questions. Highly recommend!",location
"Went beyond to make sure we were accommodated during our trip. Would recommend to anyone staying near downtown LA. Can pick up grocery within walking distance, for paper towels at Vons. Would recommend 10/10",clean
"John's place was perfect for my mini retreat! It was super clean, just like in the pictures. The space was so comfortable and homey and safe. The outdoor area was nice as well. And John was a delight to interact with. I've already booked my next stay at his place!",clean
"Not too big but perfect for a couple stay over in LA. The area is great with nice little restaurants and cafes nearby (walking and driving distance). Check in and check out worked with no problems - John has everything described very well and easy to understand! Parking on the street worked out perfectly and there was always a free spot available close by. The place it self is very clean and various amenities are provided (towels, shampoo,conditioner,hairdryer,etc.). Would definitely come back again :)!",clean
Johnâs place was perfect for our trip to LA! He made everything super easy and cozy for us.<br/>Highly recommend!,location

Communication is easy and the location is convenient to grocery stores, restaurants, farmer's markets, fitness studios and gyms of every description and, of course, the beach.",location
Marcyâs place is really perfect for 1 two 2 people and is located very close to all the best areas of Venice. Mercyâs a brilliant host and genuinely warm and wonderfully hospitable. She went out of her way to give me some of the best suggestions catering to my interests. Iâd highly recommend her place to anyone !,location
Great apartment. Light and bright and close to everything. Host very hospitable.,location
"Marcyâs place was a great place for our âbasecampâ as we ventured about LA. The location is great, as itâs a few blocks (and a couple minutes of a scooter ride) away from the beach and the trendy stores. Itâs also not too crowded where sheâs at, which was a huge plus for us. <br/><br/>One thing to note if youâre bringing a car is that her place requires you to parallel park into her gated parking spot, so make sure you feel comfortable with that if youâre expecting to drive. If not, thereâs some street parking not too far away. <br/><br/>Overall, itâs a great place and we appreciated Marcyâs warmth and friendliness!",location
"Marcy is a very good host and made us feel very welcome. The apartment is comfortable and spacious for an open plan space with plenty of features and a fully equipped kitchen. The location is also great for exploring Venice, the canals and Venice Beach.",location
"Marcie is a great host, with terrific suggestions for local places to eat. The House is  o more than a 15-20 minute walk from every destination in Venice.",location
"Nice place, though not very well located. Marcy is a good host and very attentive and careful.",location
Marcy was an excellent and accommodating host with an amazing place.,location
"Loved the place. Bright and airy during the day, and it had a private gated parking space in Venice..!!!",location
"Marcy is a great host! Parking is a bit tricky and the street itself didn't feel very safe at times. Overall, great location. In the middle of everything in Venice :)",location
"The best place that weâve ever stayed in California! Very cute studio where you will find everything that you need. And Marcy is really super host, very helpful and friendly person! It was a pleasure to communicate with her every time. Highly recommended place to stay in Venice! Weâll come back for sure.",location
"Marcy was an excellent host..her home is a great space..spotless, comfortable and private. Marcy took the time on a few occasions to stop by and make sure everything was ok with our stay. Would definitely book again!",clean

"We loved staying at the apartment. Its location was perfect, very close to the beach and Abbot Kinney Blvd and located in a good neighbourhood. The apartment itself is very bright during the day which I loved! Itâs spacious and clean. Marcy is a very nice host. She came to check if everything was alright on several occasions and gave us great tips for exploring LA and the surrounding areas. Weâd come back any time!",clean
"This was my second stay at Marcy's, and I hope to be back. She is a wonderful host and I enjoy connecting with her. I really appreciate that she doesn't use the typical toxic cleaners, laundry detergents and air ""fresheners"" that are ubiquitous at Airbnbs. <br/>It would be progressive and ecological for Airbnb to look into this issue more, as many people like myself can have health problems from exposure to the many petrochemicals in these products, such as migraines/headaches, dizziness, and other symptoms. Chemicals used in those mainstream products, including some with attractive packaging and marketing like the brand Mrs. Meyer's, are also bad for the environment. <br/>Thus I appreciate finding someone with awareness and a conscious around these issues. Normally I have to travel with my own sheets, a carbon sheet mattress protector for off gassing fumes, and also an enzyme spray to try to dull down the horrible fragrances in places I may stay. I like to travel so this is no small feat! Not having to bring all of this on a trip really is freeing. Thank you, Marcy, and Airbnb, please take notice of this issue.",clean
"This was a lovely place to stay. Bright, airy and open it was a delight to come home to this open studio apartment. The bed was comfy, the kitchen stocked and it was a wonderful place to land. About a 20-25 minute walk or 10-15 minute bike ride to the beach it is far enough away from the craziness that can be Venice Beach, but close enough to enjoy the beach. There was a parking spot in the back that does require some parallel parking skills, but it was great to have a safe off street spot to park my car. Overall, I really enjoyed this AirBnB, it was a great space and Marcy, the friendly host, made sure that everything went smoothly and helped me feel at home. Would highly recommend!",location
"A spacious, clean studio space, equal in quality to other places running $50-75 higher in the same area. Will use again when I'm in this area.",clean
"First time in LA and John's place is near all the awesome hot spots! The drive is less than 12 minutes away from Chinatown, Little Tokyo, Japanese American National Museum, The Broad Museum, and the Oue Skyspace!

What a phenomenal space! The design of the cottage is brilliant and functions quite well.  It was the perfect mini home and every amenity was considered and available.  The garden is as serene as it looks. We would definitely stay there again on future trips.,location
"John's place is in the perfect WALKABLE location to everything you need in Echo Park. It's also just a quick jaunt to Silver Lake, DTLA, etc. by car or Lyft. I loved the flora and fauna surrounding this place. Be mindful if you can't climb stairs too easily or have heavy luggage, it may be a slight challenge to get up there. I absolutely thought it was perfect for a solo traveler or young couple.",location
"John's place is an adorable and quaint space. The backyard is amazing, even better than the photo. The view of DTLA is both gorgeous during the day and in the evening. Communication with John was prompt and seamless. I really enjoyed the thoughtful touches he put in the space to make it feel like a home away from home.",location
The guest sweet is great! It is perfect for a solo traveller or a couple looking to stay on the east side of town. It was within walking distance to the the main strips in echo park and Silverlake. John was a fantastic host and easy to communicate with. Would definitely stay again.,location
Cozy & well-equipped apartment for one or two persons in the Echo Lake Park neighbourhood. It was very quiet there and the apartment offered an easy to reach starting point for the various LA main attractions. A parking space was always easy to find in the streets. Also John was a great host. It was perfect for our short stay in LA!,location
"John was a helpful and attentive host who was always quick to respond. Check-in process was a breeze. The studio is small but has everything you need and a very comfy bed. The view from the backyard was really nice! Location was perfect for us. Safe, quiet yet convenient neighbourhood, just a 5 min walk to numerous restaurants, bars, grocery stores and bus lines.",location
"A cozy studio apartment centrally located to coffee shops, bars, restaurants and everything else Sunset Blvd has to offer. When you need some downtime, the outdoor garden is the perfect place to relax. We'll definitely be back!",location
"Thanks so much John! The studio is great for a couple or solo travel. Safe area, easy parking, great location to explore silver lake/echo park/downtown(so close)...super clean&has a small kitchen to make coffee/snacks...the (semi private)backyard was awesome for morning/nite views-really really beautiful property...would definitely stay here again!",clean
This was a great place to spend a week in LA. The back yard is an amazing oasis. The space was clean and comfy with everything we needed.,clean
This place is super cozy in a great location with a great host!  I would definitely recommend and make sure to hang out in the garden at night!,location
"We were thrilled with our stay at Johns b&b.  His studio apartment was furnished perfectly, with small unexpected touches (iron and ironing board, extension cords on both sides of the bed, a full length mirror, hair dryer, mini kitchen perfectly equipped).  The garden behind the house is exceptionally beautiful.  We enjoyed early morning coffee amidst beautiful plantings of bougainvillea and a variety of succulents with several places to sit and take in the sunshine, bird songs and quiet neighborhood.  We even were welcomed to a tour of his pottery studio on the property.  After busy days sightseeing we returned to make a fire in the fire pit while enjoying a view of the LA downtown skyline.  We can't recommend his place and his personal attentiveness more highly.",location
"Johns place was the perfect little private spot, warm and welcoming! He was an attentive host and his beautiful home was equipped with everything I needed for a comfortable stay in LA. The backyard was so peaceful, I highly recommend the hammock! Thanks John!",location

"I've stayed at John's place a couple times now. I've always loved my experience, which is why I plan on coming back each time I'm in town and it is available. Make sure to book in advance as days seem to fill up quickly. John is super kind, quick to respond, and always makes me feel comfortable. The space is clean, cozy, and in a fantastic location.

The 3 musts!<br/>The hostess Marcy is lovely and makes feel you at home. I will definitely go to stay again to Marcy's studio when I will be in LA for a short time.",location
Marcy's place is a great one to stay in West LA and explore the places around. She was a great host and was readily available for our questions. The location is just perfect and it just gives you an ease to get to places in that neighborhood. <br/>Inspite of a late check-in by us- she was kind enough to help us out and make sure everything went smoothly.,host
"Very large, bright and lovely space. The bathroom is far enough from where you dine and sleep which is just perfect. The kitchen cabinets were stocked with everything you may need. The bed is super comfy, the closets are huge and everythingâs just clean. There was a yoga mat, iron, hangers, and literally anything we needed + beers ! <br/><br/>The entrance is in the alley which wasnât ideal for us. The host is super kind and sweet but she did rush me for check-in and check-out but itâs understandable. <br/><br/>Overall, very delightful stay, highly recommend",clean

"Very clean and comfy guest house. Great location close to restaurants, coffee shops and beach. Thank you for a great stay Marci! My boyfriend and I would love to stay here again if coming back to SoCal.",clean
"The location was great and things were very walkable. Marcy was pleasant and the space was very clean. She provided bottled water, some snack bars and later in our stay offered us fruit. But we ran into a few issues, I've still given Marcy a pretty decent rating because I can just tell she is the type who will address these things. First, the check in-instructions via the airbnb app were outdated. It mentioned using a gate code and after awhile of trying to figure it while outside the apartment  I called Marcy who said we don't use a code, she would just meet us when we arrived, but we were there already and had given her our flight times, but had to wait awhile for her to return. The bicycle pictured in the listing is outdated as well (Marcy said the previous bikes were stolen unfortunately). Instead of the pictured bicycle we had two very rusty ones and the one I used had brakes that were in rough shape. The left brake didn't work at all and the right one was so noisy and a pedestrian walking be told me I needed to get the bike tuned up.  The toilet backed up and we asked Marcy for a plunger but she said we should just wait a bit and try again. We did wait a couple hours and tried again to no avail, and eventually I had to use the bathroom and we had to go out and buy a plunger which immediately resolved the issue. Lastly, although there were wifi networks, the signal was far too weak to really use it. And we did try both wifi networks under the name. I think that the router is probably in her personal apartment as I didn't see one in the airbnb space or any extenders and so the signal is trying to go through multiple walls.",clean
"Marcy was such a wonderful host, and the Airbnb was exactly what I needed for the week. Everything I needed was provided and the location is central to everywhere I needed to go. Thanks again!",location
"This is a great place!<br/>Wonderful energy, great location, quiet and comfortable with cool breezes.   Definitely recommend!",location
"Marcy was a great host! She is very kind and really understands the Airbnb experience.  She even brought me up some organic peaches.  <br/><br/>Her place is larger than it looks in the photos.  Really clean and had all the things you need to make your stay very comfortable.  <br/><br/>She does have cable but not a Smart TV.   The shower is small but the water pressure was good.  I cooked some beans while I was there but mainly ate out.  Marcy had all the little extras that I needed.  Olive Oil, seasonings etc",clean
Marcy was very sweet and accommodating. I would stay here again.,clean
"Marcyâs place was the perfect spot for us to spend 10 days while we were apartment hunting in LA. It comes equipped with a full kitchen, has superb lighting and cross-breeze (clutch!) and, in our opinion, itâs in the perfect Venice location - walking distance to many fabulous restaurants, close to the beach, but not in the midst of all the action. We were able to work and live from the apartment as if it were our own home - and Marcy helped create the perfect atmosphere with welcoming and friendly hospitality.",location
Enjoyed my stay at Marcyâs place. Thank you!,location
"Great location, clean with good light. Perfect getaway spot for 1-2 people. Good for both short-term and long-term stays. Would definitely come back again!",clean
"It was great to stay once again in Marcy's Airbnb. The location couldn't be better, just a short walk to amenities and the beach. The added touches as coffee, tea, granola bars and water to start me off on my stay were welcomed.  I would happily stay there again in the future.",location

William is a gracious and low key host.  He's in a wonderful location and the room my father stayed in was clean and well appointed.  Small pool in back is a huge bonus!  highly recommended. ,clean

William & Elizabeth were great hosts-responding right away for booking and answering our questions right away.

"I loved my stay! John is a very professional, personable, kind, and caring host. I stayed at John's place for 2 whole months while I was in between apartments.

If I ever needed anything or had any questions, John was very quick to respond and was very helpful. I would definitely pay this lovely space another visit in the future!",location
"Our stay with John was great. The outdoor space was so lovely and the amenities (washer, dryer, mini kitchen) were a nice added bonus. Proximity to Sunset in Echo Park was great; quiet street was a nice respite on our trip.",location
"Our experience in the Oasis suite was nothing short of spectacular.  Just up the street from the hustle and bustle that is Sunset blvd, we were transported to a paradise of a backyard.  This was my first time using AirBNB and William and his wife made it a super convenient and easy.  Everything was so perfect: a pool with a waterfall, hot tub, fireplace, HUMONGOUS backyard.  Our room had a beautiful 4 post king bed, jetted tub, and soft towels for both the pool or the tub.  My recommendation: take in a couple of late night island cocktails at the Tiki-ti bar(five minutes walking) and a round of night swimming by the fireplace   I could go on and on, but I will leave it at this, we literally CAN NOT WAIT to stay here again.  Thank You for sharing your beautiful home with us William and Elizabeth, hope to see you again soon!!!",location
"William was an excellent host!  The pool house was beautiful and looked just as good as the photos.  The king bed is very comfortable with a mattress pad, and the bathroom is quite large for the space.

Wonderful stay, 5 stars.",location

"We felt very welcome - William & Elizabeth gave us easy check-in - check-out information.  There were snacks and water waiting for us.  <br/>The room was just as described and the back yard was beautiful, just like the pictures.  We enjoyed sitting by the pool for a few hours in the afternoons when we weren't busy out and about.  The bedroom was clean and comfortable, the bathroom was really nice.  This is not a big unit - no kitchen or sitting area.  It is like a hotel room but in a great neighborhood, awesome hosts, and wonderful backyard/pool space.<br/>This was our first time staying in Los Feliz - we really enjoyed the neighborhood.  William & Elizabeth shared some great vegan recommendations for us which was very helpful.   ",clean

Perfect place to stay! The hosts was very kind and helpful :-) Liked it a LOT!,location
I enjoyed my stay and would definitely go back.  The accommodations were very comfortable and nice.  The backyard was absolutely gorgeous!!,location
"We stayed at Elizabeth and William's oasis for a week. Our hosts were most helpful- answering questions and making sure we had everything we needed throughout our stay. The yard is gorgeous- exactly like the pictures. Very private, lots of places to hang out. One night we got take out and had dinner by the pool. The bed was super comfy,and everything we needed was in the bath. The room had a Keurig machine for coffee and tea, bottles of water and great snacks were provided. The neighborhood is great- lots of shopping and dining within walking distance. Everything was beyond expectation! This was so much better than a hotel - we will be back!",location
"Easy to find, great neighborhood, and beautiful home & courtyard.  Even though my stay was short, I enjoyed staying here.",location

Thank you!",clean
William & Elizabeth's place is located in Silver Lake which is one of the coolest areas of LA. Lots of little boutiques and restaurants within walking distance. The guest suite we stayed in was connected to the house but very quiet and private. The accommodations were very clean and comfortable. We enjoyed the pool on several afternoons. There is also a lovely fireplace and seating area but we did not get a chance to use that. There were complimentary snacks and a Keurig in the room which was a nice touch. Highly recommend if you are staying in the LA area and need a little retreat!,clean
"A hidden gem between Los Feliz and Silver Lake you couldn't ask for a better location. I almost didn't want to tell anyone about this listing because I want to be able to book it again. A perfect spot for business or pleasure. Easy to find, comfortable bed, great shower,parking, pool, hot tub, lounges and shade... basically everything you need for a LA vacation. Elizabeth & William  give you the run of their property and stop in only when needed. If you are lucky you may even see a cat. ",location
"Palm springs luxury in Los Feliz. We really enjoyed our stay with Elizabeth and William. The room was extremely clean and well kept. The grounds were impeccable. Loved the fireplace and pool. Parking was easy and convenient. Will recommend this listing to others, and would stay here again in a second.<br/>",clean
This place is amazing!! I love everything about this house! Host is very responsive. I feel so comfortable when i was staying at this place! Definitely come back!! Thank you,clean
"On our recent trip to LA, this was our top choice due to everything listed for the property, and it exceeded our expectations! The location was perfect for getting to anywhere in the city closely. Los Feliz is a great neighborhood with lots of great places to eat and shop very nearby. <br/><br/>The airbnb space itself was great! We loved the pool and the shower in our room was awesome. We were in LA for 8 days, and the room has a huge closet which kept us from living out of our suitcase. We didn't interact with William much, but Elizabeth was very sweet and friendly in all of our interactions. They are generous hosts and actually helped us out with a few small issues we ran into with things we forgot to pack. They really set the bar higher for our future airbnb experiences and next time we go to LA, we hope to stay here again.",location
"We stayed here for 2 days, it is an amazing airbnb. Great pool, close to hollywood, universal studio's , nice restaurants etc... .<br/>On top of that verry kind and friendly hosts ( ellizabeth & william).

"We had a great stay in Los Feliz! Our room was clean, comfortable, and nicely designed/decorated. The grounds are absolutely gorgeous with a lovely pool, hot tub, and outdoor fireplace. Our kind hosts even left some snacks, bottled water, and a wide variety of coffee and tea options for us to enjoy. The location is perfect for exploring the many restaurants and shops of Los Feliz on foot, and is very convenient to Silver Lake, Glendale, Hollywood, Atwater Village, and Griffith Park. With all that, it's located on a quiet street away from traffic. Our friends who we were visiting stopped by, and have already said it's going to be their first recommendation to visiting friends and family.",clean
"This Air BnB is an amazing home, so lovely to sit by the pool after a hot day in LA. Close to the main attractions. Room was very comfortable and extremely well stocked with water, etc. Bed was extremely comfortable and big enough for 2 friends to share. Elizabeth and William were great hosts and avaliable readily if we had any questions. Their recommendations for local restaurants and transport were spot on. We had a lovely time here! ",location
The Los Feliz Oasis was so nice to stay in. The pool area was the perfect place to relax. The room was super comfortable and well stocked with snacks and drinks. <br/>Elizabeth was very nice and responded quickly to any questions we had.  Would definitely stay here again! ,location
"Marcy was very accommodating and worked with our arrival time. The space was clean and inviting, slightly warm but nothing the fan couldnât fix. She does live in the unit below (I wasnât expecting to meet her and had no idea) but she was respectful of our space and time and we didnât see her after the initial arrival check in. All in all we had a great stay and really appreciated her hospitality!",clean
"Incredible stay for a few weeks! Perfect location, lovely space and great communication and hospitality by Marcy. Would absolutely stay again!",location
"Looks just like it does in the photos - lots of natural light and all of the essentials you would need including off street parking for small to medium vehicles.  Location is great, very close to restaurants, grocery store, etc.  Marcy was very responsive and check-in was a breeze. Would definitely stay again.",location

Marcy was great - communicative, friendly, and extremely helpful; her suggestions helped brighten my stay considerably and I would jump at the chance to stay here again.  Thanks for everything!",clean
"Marcy is a Superhost for GOOD reason.  She provides an especially clean, bright, beautiful beach accommodation.  The bed is extremely comfortable, has great pillows, and a well-stocked kitchen setup can also be enjoyed.  The space is large enough to use a yoga mat!  Come expecting to have fun.",clean
"Marcy is an absolutely lovely host with a fantastic studio. The location was close to Abbot Kinney by foot and and a quick drive to the beach (though definitely a drive, not a quick walk). Clean, bright natural light, and spacious for a studio. Highly recommend!",location
"The pictures donât do the place justice! Marcyâs Airbnb is absolutely gorgeous, well lit, and super spacious! It was also well equipped with everything we needed to cook a few tasty meals. Marcy was incredibly accommodating regarding our arrival and departure and gave lots of recommendations for exploring the area! If youâre looking for a cute place to stay with your SO for a few days, Marcyâs place is the spot!!",location
Marcy's place is clean and bright. Close to all of the Venice attractions. Quiet. Marcy is a very kind and attentive host.,clean
"One of the best places to stay in Venice. Marcy is a great host, really enjoyed communicating with her. The place is spacious, cozy, and has everything that you need. Itâs located perfectly, not so far from the beach, but also hides you from the business of the city. We will definitely stay here again",location
"My husband and I had a great stay in the studio, the space was very clean and peaceful. The bed was quite comfortable and wifi worked well. The location was great for us and parking on site was very convenient. Marcy was an attentive host and communication was very easy. We hope to stay here again on a future visit!",clean
"My stay at Marcy's was great! Her guest studio is clean, bright, and very peaceful. Marcy is an incredibly generous host. She went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable. We also had some great chats, which I really appreciated. I highly recommend staying at Marcy's!",clean
"First and foremost, Marcy is a lovely hostess.  She was there anytime we had a question or needed something and knows a lot about the area.<br/><br/>Her place is clean and well kept up, with lots of space for a couple and everything you might need to cook your own meals.<br/><br/>The location is very walkable, with a grocery store, cafe, and Barry's boot camp all on the same block. It's also just a 10-15 minute walk to Abbott Kinney or Rose Avenue for rows of stores and restaurants.<br/><br/>I'd ð¯ recommend staying here to any friends looking to explore the area.",clean
"Super nice, clean and conveniently located. A very comfortable spot with all the amenities that you will need for your Venice vacation! Marcy was quick to respond to any questions that we hadâ¦â¦ we will be back!",clean
"If you want to be in The Venice area, Marcyâs place is ideal. Everything youâd want is within a 5-15 minute walk. And Marcy is very responsive if you have any questions, whether about the unit, places to go, etc.",location
"Marcy was a perfectly lovely person, but for our liking, was overly present in our stay, making it feel as though there was a lack of privacy. The apartment itself was spacious and clean, but the alleyway that Marcy recommended we take to get to the apartment was glass-ridden and felt unsafe at night. We highly recommend passing by the alley route and taking the residential neighborhood route past the Ross. Finally, Marcy asks renters to not adjust the heat themselves and came over to adjust it after contacting her. However, this did not work and the apartment got unbearably hot for sleeping. All-in-all this was not the airbnb experience that we prefer, but if you enjoy a hands-on, present, and on-site host, this could be the stay for you!",location
Marcy was a kind host :),clean
Marcy was a beautiful host and went above and beyond to be accommodating and helpful from booking to check-out. We had a great time staying in her space which was conveniently located and central to most of the sites and attractions we were interested in experiencing. We had everything we needed. HIGHLY recommended for quality of care and space.,location
"Great place! Clean, bright and spacious for a studio. Marcy is responsive and accommodating. Location is convenient to restaurants and shopping. Another guest mentioned that entering through the alley is not ideal - Marcy showed me another entry approach that is hard to explain on paper, but once she showed me it was a great way to approach the house without spending more than an instant in the alley",clean
the place was exactly as advertised. Very nice studio in Venice Beach. Marcy the host was very nice and made sure to greet us.<br/>The studio had everything we needed and we would definitely recommend this place for singles or a couple. Also worth mentioning that it was very bright and clean.,clean

"Marcyâs apartment is a large upstairs studio with stove, fridge, toaster oven and microwave. It is bright and light with skylights and windows. Plenty of closet space. And very, very clean. Good wifi. Access to the apartment is from an alley that runs behind the house. You will need to make contact with Marcy so she can give you a control for the electric rolling gate so you can park your car.",clean
"Marcy was a very communicative and thorough host! She made sure that we had everything we needed to ensure a comfortable stay. The Airbnb was immaculately clean and the skylights in the ceiling let in so much natural light. To get to the separate entrance in the back of the house, you have to walk through the back alley. Still, it felt safe and secure and Marcy gave great instructions on how to call Ubers for pickup/drop-off. The location was also great to walk to nearby restaurants and Abbot Kinney. Would definitely recommend for people looking for a relaxing weekend getaway!",clean
"Such a lovely, peaceful space. The suite is private, comfortable (the bed is heavenly) and has everything you could need. Anything you donât have is a short walk away at the nearby Rite Aid or Vons. Even the post office is super close. The home is on hill (nice views usually incorporate hills lol) so for those who canât handle the climb, perhaps reconsider. The yard is totally worth it - with hummingbirds and butterflies playing...and a landscape of lovely cacti, succulents, wildflowers and lemon trees growing. Downtown LA can also be spotted from the view. John is a great communicator and gave me a ton of space. The Airbnb is connected to the house but I heard a minimal amount of noise. Would totally stay again.",location
"John's place was very comfortable, clean, quiet and cozy. The outside area has an amazing fire pit, a hammock, tons of native plants, and views of the city skyline.<br/><br/>It's also a quick drive to downtown and many other great spots around Echo Park and Silverlake.",location
Great location.  The highlight is the garden area and fire pit.   Firewood is available in a short 5min walk.  Very serene.  The indoor space is quaint and very efficient for a traveler.   A++,location
"Johnâs home was so very welcoming and nostalgic for me. It had a charm that reminded me of my old childhood home. The garden was very beautiful with the best view of the city, sitting on top of the hill. I would definitely recommend and would stay again!",location

John is a great host and his place is beautiful. The backyard space is absolutely gorgeous. The room itself has everything you need to be self-sufficient and itâs a super comfy bed to sleep on after a day of exploring.,location
"Excellent. The space is amazing. Comfortable bed, easy check in, great outdoor area, perfect Airbnb. My wife and I sat on the back patio every morning and had coffee with the humming birds flying over head. Stay here. Convenient location. As the description says, street parking was no problem. John is a great host!",location
John is a great host. Place as a great location with the versatility of walking to Echo Park and Silver Lake. Backyard is amazing with great views of DTLA. Would recommend.,location
"Marcy is an incredible human being! I am so thankful for getting the experience I did staying at her place. She had any and everything you could need. She was super accommodating and knowledgeable about the area. I had some changes in my schedule and even though I was so worried, Marcy calmed me down, understood, and helped me through it all! She is very very kind, and if you have the opportunity to stay at her Airbnb, definitely take it! ð¯",host
We had a great stay at Marcyâs. She had timely communication and fun recommendations. The location is perfect to walk to tons of nearby restaurant and attractions - we loved Abbott McKiney road and the beach - and yet secluded enough to be quiet and peaceful. Would definitely stay again!,location
"Clean, bright studio, excellent host. Iâve stayed at Marcyâs a few times before as well; it is my go-to when I am visiting family in LA. Awesome all around, and I plan to be back.",clean
"Marcy's studio is well-light, spacious, and perfect for access to LA's west side. The parking space is a little tricky to get into and out of - we struggled a bit with even a mid-sized sedan, so if you have a larger vehicle you may not fit. However, it was great to have a parking space available in Venice!",location
This is a great place to stay for anyone that wants to be close to anything in Venice.<br/>Marcy is an amazing host and is super welcoming. <br/>Definitely recommend this apartment,location
Cannot say enough great things about Marcy and the property. Exactly as described and Marcy is an absolute pleasure. I have friends very close by and plan on being a frequent guest. Thanks again Marcy!!!,location
The location was great. 15 minute walk to the beach and great shops and a short drive to other points of interest. Clean space; parking was easy (on-site with street options available too). Marcy coordinated well with us on our check-in/check-out timing.,location
"Marcy is a fantastic host. She is so personable and helpful! Me and my partner were so happy to get to know her! Also, Marcy has been in the area for a long time and has such a great knowledge of the community, and was more than happy to share her experiences with us! <br/><br/>Me and my partner actually had a really bad first day in LA because our car got broken into while we were in downtown. Marcy was super caring in making sure we were okay, and even bought us a bottle of wine as comforting gesture! <br/><br/>In regards to the space, it was super clean, and perfect for our vacation. There are small skylights that make a perfect wake up in the mornings! Loved it! The private parking spot is also such a great PLUS! <br/><br/>In regards to the location -- omg perfection! Me and my partner love morning strolls, good coffee/breakfast, and small shops! Cute shops and restaurants are right around the corner, including Superba, SO DELICIOUS! Abbott Kinney Blvd and Venice canals are SUPER close by as well! <br/><br/>Overall, our experience here made us love venice!!! We definitely will be visiting LA again, and mean it when we say we will want to rebook with Marcy!",host

I would definitely return. Highly recommended.",location
"Marcy's apartment is a clean, open space, exactly as advertised.  The apartment is right in the middle of Venice, close to several restaurants, bars, as well as shops.

We checked into our room which was clean and awaiting our arrival to be greeted by a fully stocked mini fridge, coffee maker, first aid kit ... You name it, they had it available. My husband and I were visiting the LA area for the weekend while I was on a business trip and our hosts answered all questions so quickly, even when I felt I was being a pain lol. The grounds were so well maintained and were the perfect escape from our crazy New York lifestyle. The pools continuous waterfall and the fountain by the room we rented was the perfect white noise to put you to sleep! I cannot wait to tell everyone about our rental property and definitely cannot wait to book with them again!!! Thank you so much for making us so comfortable! We will be in touch ",clean

His place was extremely clean and everything I needed was provided upon arrival. When I requested something, he responded immediately to my text and provided what I asked for within the day.

Thanks for being a great host, John!",clean
"I had a very comfortable stay at John's accommodation. His backyard is a beautiful display of semi-arid vegetation. I really should have availed myself of it more, but my other obligations kept me fairly busy. Working from John's was easy enough and I had some of the best sleep in any AirBnB ever - it's a great mattress. Thanks John!",location

Inside has everything you would need, was super clean, and functional. The bathroom was really nice and spacious too. Parking was a little tricky in the area, probably due to more people staying put throughout the day. We would definitely stay here again!",clean
"Johnâs place was a cozy bedroom with all amenities you could need included. There was also a beautiful garden in the backyard with seating, lemon trees, and a hammock, which was a joy to be in. The western look it conveyed with cacti and other desert-like elements made the stay feel that much more authentic to Southern California. All in all I enjoyed my stay very much and would recommend booking with John.",location

John was a gracious host, and his backyard, with its incredible view, is clearly made with love and he is happy to share it. I stayed during height of LA pandemic after traveling, was an ideal spot to lay low.",location
It is almost exactly as advertised. I would say it is a place that most folks would find satisfactory for limited stays near downtown LA and the neighborhoods of silver lake and echo park.,clean
"My 9-year old and I just spent a little over 3 weeks at John's place while visiting my family who live a few blocks away.  My kiddo gave it a 10/10 and I agree!  The space is compact (all one room with an attached bathroom) but perfectly laid out with strong wifi so we were both able to do remote work + school using the desk, couch + outside space.  The backyard is incredible and you get your own little slice of it with a small private patio with a table + chairs and enough space to do yoga + workouts.  Having easy access to the washer/dryer was key for our long stay and the little fridge, two electric burners + sink combo was great for our daily cooking.  The kitchen was well stocked with pots, dishes, cutlery + utensils. <br/>John was really easy to communicate with, checked in on us and made sure we had what we needed but gave us our space and was really courteous.  The backyard is truly an oasis - we will be coming back when we can!",location

I would highly recommend this place and would happily visit again!,location
William and Elizabeth have a gorgeous place and they go above and beyond to provide for their guests. The pool and tub are amazing. We would definitely love to stay here again.

Quaint little gem near Hollywood. Outdoor area is pretty amazing and plenty of room to lounge. Elizabeth and William were very accommodating and are gracious hosts. Would highly recommend! ,location
"We just loved staying at William and Elizabeth's Los Feliz flat. A resort like experience with an amazing contrast: their flat on a quiet  neighborhood street just blocks away from the bustle of Hollywood and Sunset Blvds. Their Los Feliz district is replete with restaurants, bars , coffee shops and even a vintage movie theater..all easy walks..  we even walked up to the Griffith Park Observatory from their place.  The room is small with a comfy king and nice bath, opens out to  a small courtyard facing the other flat, and up a few stairs to a shady pool deck with comfy lounge seating. Right sized pool for frolicking with the grandchild. Elizabeth is helpful and friendly and we enjoyed discussing her 3 charming  kitties that grace the grounds.<br/>We hope to return someday",location
"William and Elizabeth's Oasis was exactly that - a beautiful escape from the hustle and bustle of city life.  We very much enjoyed our stay, and especially liked the pool and jacuzzi - the courtyard is beautiful and very well kept, truly a getaway space.  Although the room was smaller than we would have liked, it was clean and comfortable, and the snacks and information package were much appreciated.  Overall, great experience!",clean

So very comfortable I think I had THE best couple of nights sleep I've had in a very long time! It's within walking distance to Griffith Park which is exactly where we headed as soon as we got here. The following evening we spent an hour or so relaxing in the garden in the hot tub. Would highly recommend staying here & would definitely come back on my next trip to LA.,location

I would definitely recommend this place for other couples looking for a place to stay on the east side (close to all the great bars and restaurants) but still want a taste of the west side (the outdoor space and pool make it a relaxing retreat). Exactly what we wanted!",location
This was my first time using Air BnB and it was lovely! William and Elizabeth were very sweet and their home was absolutely gorgeous. They have everything you could possibly need. I would definitely recommend their place to anybody. Thanks so much guys! ,location
Jackeline is very friendly host and help. I will stay at again. The place is nice and clean and close to everything.,clean
"As always, John was a great host! His studio is very clean and has everything you would need! He is very attentive and I once again enjoyed the backyard ambience and view of the city!",clean
We had a great time at Johnâs. We stay in Echo Park often so we enjoyed the stay and how close it was to everything we are familiar with. Definitely check out The Valerie on Echo Park Ave & Lucretia. Best coffee shop around and only a 12 minute walk from this stay. Thanks John!,location
John's place was comfy and clean. It was with walking distance of a supermarket and coffee shops. I would recommend staying here.,clean
Jackeline and her daughter are very nice people!<br/>The house was very clean and exactly as advertised.<br/>10/10 would recommend.,clean
Beautiful house to stay in. Loved the back yard and pool. Liked the big four poster bed too. Very straightforward booking process too,location
"Location and space was great! For those looking to explore areas around downtown LA, this is a perfect spot since itâs quite close to many hotspots. The drive to Santa Monica and Long Beach isnât bad either, especially if itâs outside of rush hour.",location
"The room was everything I expected it to be.  I found the property to be very clean, quiet and well furnished.  The location was perfect and the entrance instructions were exceptionally easy.  The free snacks were a very nice touch too.  My only regret was that I didn't have enough time to enjoy the extravagant patio and pool area!  Anyone looking to stay in the Los Feliz area would be very comfortable here.",clean
"I was welcomed with a nice basket of snacks, cold water in the refrigerator and a list of local restaurants. <br/>The room was clean, bed comfortable and shower was luxurious. Room was very quiet and private.Outdoor area was as beautiful as photos depicted,with pool and waterfall.Safe, picturesque and well located  neighborhood . I never met the hosts but they were available if needed. I would stay here again should the occasion arise.",location
"This is a nice apt, I really enjoy that period of time there. ",location
"Jackeline was awesome! We went down to LA for the weekend for a concert and weren't sure of our arrival time to her house, but she was understanding and willing to work with us in terms of checking in and everything. Very nice place if youre planning a fun weekend with a few friends in this area of town!",location
"The place is spacious, it has a garage, all the comfort required. Everything was clean and in perfect shape.<br/>We missed maybe some table wear and silver wear.<br/>Jacqueline is a kind host and everything was prepared for our arrival.<br/>Thanks! ",clean
John is a great host! Responded to my inquiries really fast. The space is as described but a lot smaller than I thought. I 'd say it is no more than 300 square feet but it was not an issue for my partner and I since we really were there to sleep and get ready in the mornings. Didn't get to enjoy the garden or fire pit (huge selling point) unfortunately because I was on the go the whole time. Parking was easy to find. Oh and the Brita pitcher provided an endless supply of filtered water which I truly appreciated in the LA heat.,clean
Such a great place in an amazing location. Super cute backyard and in the center of everything. Would definitely try to stay here again on my trip back to LA,location
Amazing and very comfortable space. John is great with communication and very helpful. Would definitely stay here again and would recommend to anyone.,location
This place is great. Truly in the perfect spot to take a jaunt around Echo Park or Silverlake. Everything you need is pretty much on sight and itâs nicely secluded/quiet if you need to spend your stay working from home like I did!,location
"we loved staying at John's! the space is as described, check-in was easy with detailed instructions, and John was quick to respond to our questions. we enjoyed close proximity to Echo Park and Silver Lake neighborhoods. would absolutely stay here again!",location
Johnâs place is very clean and perfect for a solo traveller on a short stay in LA. The backyard is gorgeous and a super relaxing and quiet oasis in a bustling city. The room is equipped with everything you could need and John was great at responding if I had any questions.,clean
"We loved our stay at John's place!  It is clean and very well equipped for such a compact space!  Parking was always easy on the streets nearby and the location is perfect for us to be close to our aging father.  We've already booked our next stay and will always check here first when we need to be in the area (we can't say that for any other place we've stayed in!).  For the price, it really can't be beat!",clean
"This was our second time at John's and we hope the space will be available in February when we need to return to the area again!  The description & photos are very accurate, parking has never been a problem (at the most we had to go around two blocks to find a space when coming in later and never more than a block to walk - usually find space right out front), it is clean and very well thought/laid out, and the bed is very comfortable!",clean
"Really nice area, the place have everything you need and love the backyard !:) John is very cool and good host.",location
"Amazing place! Stayed here for a month and it has everything you need for a long stay. Clean, comfortable, easy check in, stocked with all the amenities, fast and reliable wifi if you need to work remotely. Easy walk to popular Echo Park and Silverlake bars/restaurants/shops, and when you need a break from the city, the backyard is really special and relaxing, with an excellent view and garden. Also, John's a great and communicative host. Would 100% stay here again.",location
"What an epic spot! Loved my month stay at Johnâs. The private unit is super clean and comfortable and the backyard with a fire pit, hammock, lemon tree and beautiful view of downtown La is an added bonus. Parking on the street wasnât a problem and itâs walking distance to all the good restaurants in echo park and the park itself. Would definitely stay again and John was very kind!",location
"Iâd highly recommend staying at Johnâs. The apartment is well appointed for a long-term stay including a great mattress, spare linens, a wonderful little coffee maker, a big bathroom with a lovely shower, the best washing machine and dryer and a big desk and comfortable chair. John is lovely. He was responsive throughout my stay and even offered to let me store a few things in another building on the property. The location is also excellent - close to several grocery stores, parks and hip restaurants and bars on Sunset. I couldnât have had a better experience. Thanks, John!",location
"Nicole was a fantastic host, and exceeded all possible expectations. I sent a last minute request to book, and she responded very quickly. The place wasn't ready, and it was late in the day, but she got everything set up before I arrived. The place was great - conveniently located and every amenity - I only wish I had time to use the hot tub. Next time!",host

The house is wonderfu! The whole house was beautifully light and airy. The decoration is very fitting for self-occupation clean!,clean

"The apartment was better than expected. I love the front porch privacy. The neighbors were friendly and the location was near everything I needed.<br/>The only downfall was the parking. Due to the number of cars in the driveway I had to park on the street each night. I would definitely recommend this location for easy access to LAX, beaches and downtown.",location

"My host was understanding of why I could not stay but had prior knowledge of infestation. The response she provided when I explained to her about the roaches was she had been there earlier 2 tighten things up and everything seemed fine. Which explains why when we entered the house the heater had been placed on 90. As soon as we turned it off and opened a window roaches came from everywhere in he light, from the bathroom sink, in the kitchen I was disgusted and left 15mins after entering. ",clean
"We stayed four nights at Jackeline's apartment. We were a group of five guys doing a trip whitin California. The apartment was as described, very clean and comfortable.

Cozy spot within walking distance of many stores and Restaraunts. Cute clean and comfortable. ,location
"It was an interesting experience, as the host had a family emergency, and it was also over the Christmas weekend. There were some issues with a couple appliances, however in the end the issues were sorted out with the host. This is most likely an anomaly of an experience, as the place is nice with a modern finish, though it is not in the best part of town. There is enough space for 5 to stay comfortably, and there are tons of restaurants and shops nearby. ",clean
It was a great location if you wanted to stay near LAX,location
"We had a wonderful time. The accommodations were just as described. Pool area was gorgeous, and provided a great respite from the LA heat! Communication with hosts was easy and prompt. Very cool neighborhood.",location
"The flat was exactly as described and a perfect LA experience. We loved having a beautiful little oasis in the city to return to each day.

Elizabeth was an excellent host. She anticipated nearly all of my needs. I really appreciate that there were some small snacks that we ate for breakfast and that she went out of her way to print out my concert tickets.,host
"What an wonderful oasis to help escape the L.A. heat! I met Elizabeth briefly and she was very nice. William and her have a lovely set up, we enjoyed it thoroughly. I wish we could have stayed longer but alas, back to the real (working) world. I would definitely stay here again. ",location
"William & Elizabeth are kind hosts and respond very fast to emails and texts. But I have not met them in person. The bed is very comfortable and the bathroom with jacuzzi is beautiful and looks modern. Also the outside area with heated pool is nice. The neighborhood seems to be safe. A supermarket as well as nice restaurants and bars are in walking distance. So all in all I enjoyed my stay at their apartment. Thank you, William & Elizabeth. :)",clean
"Fantastic place to stay. ""The Flat"" has everything you might need for a great stay. The location is wonderful as you're out of the craziness of various LA touristy spots but really easily accessible. And you can walk down the street to gorgeous cafes, bars and restaurants.<br/><br/>The garden is fabulous. A beautiful pool and outdoor hot tub make this a very luxurious stay.<br/><br/>Elizabeth & William were really friendly hosts, very hospitable and always checking in to see if we needed anything. Which we didn't as it was perfect!",location
"The location and the garden / pool are amazing, the room is exactly as described, absolutely clean and everything was perfectly arranged in terms of getting into the room / garden as well as the recommendation Elisabeth & William left in the room (I think we tried 3 or 4 of them); parking is incredibly easy. <br/>However, don't expect too much of a personal  touch that makes Airbnb sometimes  so special, it's more like a very good small Hotel where everything is self-served. I will definitely return next time!",clean
"This was a great Airbnb experience and William and Elizabeth were awesome. Elizabeth was very inviting and even provided drinks, wine, snacks, and coffee! We met her briefly when we arrived a few minutes early and she made sure we were comfortable throughout our stay. Their home is amazing and although we were too tired to use the pool and hot tub, everything looked clean and top notch. The home is centrally located and close to everything. For any Elliott Smith fans that want to see the Solutions wall, it's only a few blocks away. ",clean
"This was our first experience with Airbnb and we are really happy to say it was a good one!  The hosts thought of EVERYTHING!  I don't think more thought could have been put into the place. Extra touches including suggestions for local places to eat  I never saw the cats, I was a little paranoid we would accidentally let them out, but we never saw them.",clean
"Los Feliz Oasis describes this stay perfectly. This flash listing was able to accommodate a last minute booking and provided a very spa like experience. Located in one of my favorite neighborhoods in LA with a great shower, Keurig, and pool. ",location

It really is a beautiful property and I would absolutely stay here again! Thanks for a lovely stay!",location
"William & Elizabeth's home was PERFECT! It is a tranquil beauty right in the heart of spewing LA.  We had a quick overnight stay before heading out of town the next morning and it was just what we needed. The bed was super comfortable, bathroom was gorgeous and they even left snacks and coffee/tea. The room opens up to the amazing courtyard with plenty of serene sitting areas and a pool & jacuzzi. We will definitely stay here again and recommend to our friends who want to explore Silverlake or nearby areas. ",location
"We needed a place to stay at the last minute, and Elizabeth made it super easy. She was prompt and responsive and available for anything we needed. Street parking was easy and the private entrance was nice. I really enjoyed the sound of the fountain in the mornings and sitting by the pool, looking at the hills of Silverlake. The location was perfect for our needs.",location
"great, well stocked, clean, everything we needed, perfect bed, pool, jacuzzi. ",clean
"Elizabeth and William were very friendly, communicative, and helpful hosts. I stayed in the room connected to (but still very separate from) their main property. The bed was large and the bathroom was spacious, with plenty of closet space in the room. The mini fridge was stocked with bottled water and the Keurig machine was also nice to have at my disposal. I thought the multi-sprayhead shower was a bit unusual at first, but quickly learned to love it.<br/><br/>I thought I'd be renting the room with an available washer/dryer, but that's actually the other available room on their property (however, easily solved by a short walk to a nearby laundry mat). The area is clean, quiet and convenient (brunch, grocery, liquor store and night spots very accessible on foot or a short Uber ride away). They were also very understanding and responsive about an urgent overnight FedEx I needed to receive at their property on the date of my arrival. Thank you both!",clean
"Nicole was a terrific host and the place was great. The location is just a few minute walk to all the PDR restaurants, and just a few more to the beach. Nicole left all sorts of treats out and in the fridge, and provided hotel style soaps, etc. The space is very large with a full kitchen, living room, and separate sleeping area. Definitively a great place to stay.",clean
"I stayed at Nicole's place with a friend visiting from out of town. We loved it! The hot tub really puts it over the top. The apartment itself is small, but spacious. She was out of town during our stay but made herself available to our needs & checked in often. Really nice view from deck. 3 things to note: we couldn't connect to the WiFi, the shower door doesn't stay closed sometimes bc it's worn out. We had issues with the temperature. She supplies towels, iron, extra bedding, food in fridge, cooking needs & toiletries. The location is really nice, you are right on the beach & 10 min away from Venice beach, close to airport & can drive into the downtown and Hollywood areas in less than 30 min. All in all a very positive experience, beautiful, safe neighborhood, go to Bacari for brunch if you like eclectic cuisine (walking distance). I will go back to Nicole's apt with my husband when we need a little weekend getaway =)",location
"This space was amazing, Nicole is one of the sweetest people I've met. I highly recommend this space, the pool/hottub are perfect, I'm definitely renting this space again when I return in August.  ",location

"The little flat we stayed in was so cozy and beautiful! I didn't swim because it was too cold, but I did hang out near the pool and get in the hot tub! The hot tub was amazing and the pool is gorgeous! I also meditated for a bit in the little fire pit alcove which was so peaceful in the morning! William and Elizabeth were so responsive and helpful! They reminded us to be sure we parked on the right side of the street so we wouldnt get a ticket! We only stayed for a night but I would certainly come back!",location
"We have a wonderful time in LA, Elizabeth was super nice to us, and the place is extremely convenience.<br/>We will definitely stay in the same place if it is possible!",location
"Spent a very comfortable night at William and Elizabeth's place. Even though we arrived late Saturday night, Elizabeth promptly responded to a text when we had a question about the location of the heating unit in the room. (After the the text exchange, we discovered that detailed instructions for everything--including the heat--were listed on a guest-info sheet.) The room and property were beautiful and well-maintained--and the bed extremely comfortable. We also appreciated the snacks, bottled water, and other treats. Since we had to leave early the next morning, we didn't get a chance to enjoy the pool, hot tub, and terrace. Wish we could have stayed longer.",clean

The room is clean, cozy and the bed comfy. Kind bars, water in the fridge, and a coffee maker were all nice touches that make you feel very at home.",clean
"This is our second time staying here and it is a freaking magical place.  I can't wait to book again.  There is a heated pool, hot tub, jacuzzi tub for 2 small people or 1 big person in the room.  Everything is close by; dtla, hollywood, ktown, restaurants, bars, theater or market.  I may need to talk with Liz and Will (that's what I call them now lol) about moving my stuff in.

"We had a great time in LA. This Airbnb is located in a great spot for to see everything LA has to offer. We had six people stay for a week, 2 adults and 4 kids. It provided us exactly what we needed. A place to sleep at night while we enjoyed all of LA. It is located very close the the airport so that is convienent but the planes can also get noisy. It had great hot water for six of us. We never ran out! The bunk bed and twin bed in one bedroom was perfect for our kids. I would recommend this place to anyone traveling to LA. Jackeline was very responsive. She allowed us to check in a little early because we landed LA very early.",location
"Overall, this house and this experience was just okay. <br/><br/>Pros: this house is very close to a lot of stores, restaurants, and shopping. The location is GREAT! I did feel safe in this house and the neighborhood did feel safe <br/><br/>Cons: ah, where to start? <br/><br/>Check-in was a bit bumpy. The host waited until I contacted her to tell me how to check in and even then, she forgot to tell me that there was a unit number. Check-in could have definitely been smoother. <br/><br/>I stayed with my family for three nights. There were 5 of us. The host left us exactly 5 towels and not a single wash cloth. We had to go buy extra towels and wash cloths, something I feel should definitely be provided as part of your stay. There were about 5 paper towels left in the bathroom on the sink, I think to dry your hands if you use the restroom? Not sure how anyone would think that would be sufficient for a 4 Day weekend. <br/><br/>The house had an odd smell. Maybe I havenât stayed in enough Airbnbâs to know, but this house definitely had a very old odd smell to it. We had to go buy some air fresheners for every room. <br/><br/>The washer and dryer. Yes, there is a washer and dryer but the washer was so loud that I got scared using it. We stopped it mid-cycle and figured weâd just wash when we got home. <br/><br/>Beds. Each bed had one sheet and one thin blanket on it. No extra bedding or blankets anywhere in the house. Makes for very cold nights if you leave the air conditioning on. Also, the bunk beds are so squeaky and loud with any movement at all, it makes it impossible to put someone on that top bunk and have anyone else in the room get any sleep. <br/><br/>Checkout is 11:00am, but the host sent a housekeeper at 10:30am AND sent an email asking that the house be clean before the house keeper got here. The baseboards and floors in this house were absolutely filthy when we got there. I get that this is an older house, but cleanliness should never be in question. <br/><br/>Feels like this host cut quite a few corners and did the bare minimum to have people stay here. The host could likely have much happier guests if they focused on some details and provided a little more convenience and comfort to their guests. <br/><br/>Likely wouldnât stay here again.  I will pay the extra money and stay somewhere a little nicer and a little more accommodating, but overall, was not a bad stay. Just not for me.",location
"Super cute place with a tricky street entrance, this spot is a good value if you are traveling with more than 4 people. The decor is great and the fridge is HUGE!  There isn't a dishwasher, so if you hate washing up, you will want to eat out mostly. We made smoothies every morning--great blender!  Right not, the main street is under construction, so the noise is more than the jets overhead.  If you are looking for easy access to LAX and the Forum, STAY HERE.  If you are hoping to chill a bit and relax, you may not love the engine noise.  We actually had a good time listening to the little kid across the walk laugh and giggle like a mad man. It was too cute!",location
Great stay! Would definitely stay again. Thanks!,location
Neat little place conveniently located close to the airport. We did have issues with the WiFi but Jackeline quickly took care of it. Thanks for the stay!,location

"The location is excellent. Just one block away from a number of eating options,supermarket and shopping. The place was clean and Jackline and Laura resolved any issues that came up swiftly and effectively. When we arrived, the TV and internet was not working and it was fixed the next morning  in spite of being a Sunday. The place is neat and as shown in the pics. One down side is the noise from planes when you use the open air patio as the place is close to the airport. Once you are inside the house there is no noise at all. Would like to stay next time.",clean
"This is such a great place to be at. The house was clean, stylish, plenty of room and the outside patio was perfect for relaxing. The neighborhood is really nice and modern, a lot of stores, restaurants, casino and close to the beach.  Highly recommended!",location
"Jackeline's house was amazing! Check-in was nice and easy, the place itself was absolutely beautiful on the inside. It is right next to a main street so it is a little bit louder but you won't notice much if you're inside. The front area is fenced in with a good amount of privacy and 4 chairs with a table. I'm not from California so we were using the umbrella to hide from the hot sun. Living room is nice and large. Has a good tv with netflix and a few other services attached. Internet was under the tv and we had issues with it the 2nd day. Nothing a quick unplug and plug back in didn't fix. Try this first before bothering the host. Kitchen was nice and cozy. We made breakfast every morning and even made a few smoothies! The blender is a great touch!!! Bedrooms are nice and the beds were comfortable to sleep on. My only complain is that we weren't there longer.",location
I was very pleased with my stay here. I would recommend anyone to stay here ð. It was very close to so many places. Also very quiet as well when you want to relax. Thank you for everything!,location

"The place is exactly as expected based on the ad. Good deal and very conveniently located if you're attending an event at The Forum, which is what I was in town for.",price
"Laura is an excellent host, very accommodate with what we needed during our stay. The place is very clean, just like everyone has mentioned here, I have been using Airbnb for many years, it was the most cleanest house I ever stayed! The location is safe and close to many stores, very convenient for traveler. The only small issue is the note of how to use TV and Internet, need to be updated for correct information. Overall, enjoyed our stay there. Definitely recommend to everyone. ",clean
It is very nice. I will recommend to my friends to select the house.,location
Appreciate the Hosts fast communication and willingness to allow us to check in earlier. We just needed a place to shower and sleep at for the Thanksgiving weekend. Jackeline's home was just that.,location
Very convenitet and great place to stay at,location
"My brother and our sons attended  the Rose Bowl Parade & Game, plus did plenty of sightseeing during our visit to LA.  This accommodation was perfect for us!  It was clean,  had comfortable bedding, nice common areas, was close to quality shopping/restaurants and the location was a short drive to everything you'd want to visit in LA.  I would definitely recommend this property for your stay in LA.",clean
Host cancelled few hours before our checkin. We had to find a new place.,location
"Despite the location being Inglewood, I liked this place.",location
It was a amazing apartment...I would refer anyone to the humble household....,clean
Very clean place with everything you need. Will definitely stay again,clean
"Would like to say this was a great place to stay for the weekend. Location was not bad, LA is very crowded so being in Inglewood was a luxury. Thanks Jackline",location
We had a complete blast! The house was so nice the beds were so comfortable! Like the one room had 1 bed I thought omg that is going to be way to small but we got on to the bed it was some of the best sleep ever!!! I need to know where she got that bed I need it for my guess room at home! The whole house is decorated red black and white!! Omg so beautiful! It was very clean and enjoyed every min we were in the house! Big tip make sure when putting the code in the door you let the top<br/>Light blink 3xs and then push the door open! But we want to thank you again the house was down the street from everything!!!,clean
"Super clean, great location close to the airport, easy check in, great parking space, and cool amenities.",clean
"I will write an honest review once our dispute is settled. I believe the issue is with her housekeeper, not Jackeline. Jackeline was quick to respond and got things done quickly.",clean
"This was my first time using an AirBnB and I will say that it wasn't the best experience for me. I booked it exactly a month before I would stay. At the time I booked there was a generic message you could send to the host letting her know you're looking forward to staying there. Never heard anything back. A few days before I would stay I reached out to her via text to find out how to go about entry to the place since I never received anything prior. She did respond within a timely manner stating that I would receive that information a day before check-in. A day before came and I haven't heard anything so of course I'm feeling a little worried as to whats going on so I called AirBnB to make sure everything was everything. They got in touch with her and got back with me and said that she is out the country and was having trouble with some Wi-Fi or something so that's why she wasn't able to get in touch with me, mind you they was able to reach her.  So finally she sends over the email on how to enter the place. It stated to let her know when we would arrive so she or whoever would meet me there. I responded back and said that I would be there late that evening. No response. I get there and no one is there to meet me. The instructions state that the code to get in was x,y, z. Thank goodness I just recently learned how to use a lock box/keypad because it sure didn't state how to properly use it, where you have to hit the unlock button, put it in the code and hit unlock again. Also, the keypad kept malfunctioning the whole time I was there so I had to stand there and keep putting in the code over and over in order for it to open. Get into the place so I wanted to turn the Tv on and hook up the Wi-Fi and everything but for some reason its not working. I'm playing around with the Tv and remotes like what is going on, why I can't figure this out. So I say to myself maybe the batteries are dead, I go to open the back of it and there is only one battery out of 2 that was in it, so there goes so much for watching Tv. Decided to take a shower. Water took awhile to warm up, no biggie but during the shower water starts getting cool so I turn it all the way up to hot and the water turned completely cold on me. I don't think no one wants to take a cold shower. Decided to wash some towels, washing machine was really loud, I thought is was going to break down. Woke up the next morning to blaring music from the neighbor across the way. Keep in mind I had no TV to possibly drown it out. Kept a few things in the refrigerator, which the doors kept sticking and was kind of hard to open and close because they were a little off. So its finally time to check out and I will say I was running a bit behind check out time. So I got a couple missed calls from her and a text message while I was packing my things that the housekeeper is there waiting to clean the place, which I thought hey she must be back in the country and can reach out now. I received and email at 7:30 am stating what to do upon leaving. I'm not sure who checks there email at 7:30 in the morning because I don't . But the email stated to 'thoroughly' clean the kitchen and counters, take out the trash, put all linen in laundry baskets. I'm just trying to figure why did I pay a $90 cleaning fee if I have to do all that. Also it stated to put the key back in the mailbox upon leaving, remember there is no key, only a keypad on the door. Another template/generic message...",host

Great host!,host
"Nicole and her boyfriend were absolutely amazing! Me and my friends stayed here for our spring break and they were so welcoming! This was our first airbnb experience and it was awesome! The house is more beautiful in person. Nicole made us feel right at home and one night even invited us to hang with her friends and had tacos for us! I definitely recommend this place, and I definitely would go back!",clean
"Jackelineâs house was great for our group of 5, she let us drop off our bags until the home was ready for check in. She had plenty of towels and blankets, we never ran out of hot water. We did experience a little issue with the lock where the code wasnât working but after a few tries it worked fine. Netflix was on and off but overall we had a great time and enjoyed our stay!",clean
Stayed for 2 nights for a concert and it was very pleasant. Hosts responded quickly and were really nice and accommodating. Place is also walking distance from various stores and was convenient.,location
"Jackeline was really reactive to respond to our requests for missing equipment (not enough forks and spoons, no broom nor hairdryer and iron as there were supposed to be) and brought it to us the next day, brand new. <br/>Contact was easy. <br/>Apartment was really clean, bed done and nice towels. <br/>Near the airport so practical but be aware you really can hear the planes, still we could sleep well. <br/>We had to leave earlier than planned and Jackeline was really comprehensive so thanks again!",clean
This place is perfect for people coming from out of town to shows at the forum.<br/><br/>Very clean and well equipped townhouse . Would definitely recommend to stay there.,clean
Great place to be if you're looking forward to seeing the west side of Los Angeles.  Inglewood is a great city where I'd prefer to live.  Great place!,location
We appreciated our stay in this home. A well located place with all equipment. Easy to park your car.,location
Perfect house and perfect host.,location
"Reasons NOT to stay here: <br/>1)  Unclear check in instructions and the host did not answer the phone as we were having difficulties trying to enter the apartment. The host did not mention certain instructions in her directions in order for the key pad to unlock. I had to call Airbnb customer service because my family and I were stranded. We ended up getting a late message from Jacklyn stating that her phone was dead. Jacklyn then called her housekeeper who did not speak English to let us in. <br/>2) The apartment was just ok. The pictures does the apartment must justice. The living area is small, the table top was broke, there were no blinds in the kitchen window. For privacy from the neighbors, my husband used the extra sheets to hang up in the kitchen window. The master bedroom is terribly small and the mattress is laying on a fragile bed frame. Lastly the bathroom was not clean. There was hair in the tub and the shower curtain lining was filthy. <br/>3. NO HOT WATER- I texted Jacklyn whom had stated the maintenance man is unavailable and she will get back to me in the morning. I asked for a ETA and Jacklyn responded âwhen he texts me back, I will let you knowâ. <br/><br/>The no hot water was the icing on the cake for my family and I. I immediately called Airbnb to request a refund. <br/>This by far was the WORST Airbnb I have ever experienced. Jaclyn has yet to reach out to me regarding the hot water and the overall experience.",location
Enjoyed my stay here.  The outdoor area really was a great little oasis (the yard was a bit smaller than I expected but it in no way took away from its tranquility).  I was in the pool/hot tub as much as possible. Elizabeth was very helpful and just a text away when needed.,location
"We had a wonderful time in the lovely space of Elizabeth and William. The room was neat and tidy, and well stocked with coffee, water and the likes. The garden area was lush and beautiful, and what really made the difference for us. Perfect place to catch some sun, or chill after a day of exploring the area. We thoroughly enjoyed it.",location
"We fell in love with the back yard! The waterfalls from the pool made it so relaxing! The jacuzzi was just the right temperature. The tall plants gave it a nice jungle feel to it. Such a nice quiet neighborhood with many restaurants within walking distance! Unami Burger (3-4 blocks away) is an excellent restaurant with wonderful staff! I like the location and how close we were to Hollywood! The bed in the flat was very comfy! Thanks for the snacks and beverages, too! We would definitely stay again! ",location
"We had a wonderful stay with Elizabeth and William! It is obvious that they put a lot of thought and effort into their guests' comfort. Both private and shared areas were very clean, there were plenty of towels, pillows, blankets, etc., check in was painless and just as described, hosts were extremely responsive to messages and made us feel welcome without being too invasive. If I find myself in the area again, this will be the first place I check for lodging. I would highly recommend a stay here. ",clean
"The flat was perfect!  The bed is huge, linens are comfy, nice toiletries, complimentary snacks and beverages.  The photos don't do the place justice! The backyard is pure heaven!

Everything was great! Just as advertised and the hosts were very welcoming and friendly. Great location too - easy ride to DTLA. I will definitely be booking this spot again. ,location

The bedroom and bathroom are clean and cozy and the bed is comfortable. We didn't have the opportunity to use the pool but the lounge area had lots of nice places to hang out. We never met Elizabeth and William but the were very helpful and quick to respond to our messages - they even reminded us when it was time to move our car to the other side of the street. We would definitely stay here again, and the cats are both cute and social :)",clean
"I absolutely loved my stay here. The neighborhood is safe to walk around, with tons of shops and restaurants. The pictures of her home do not do this place justice because it's even more beautiful in person. Elizabeth was super sweet and even had a basket and a directory waiting for me. She answered immediately to any calls and messages. I can't wait to stay at her place again. Thank you Elizabeth. ",location
"The place was wonderful! The location was great with lots to do within walking distance. <br/><br/>Elizabeth did a great job of taking care of everything we requested. <br/><br/>The room was connected to their home so we had to be mindful of our noise level. <br/><br/>Overall, we had a great experience I would HIGHLY recommend this place!

"This unit is really well-appointed and extremely well-located.  Los Feliz and Silver Lake are super fun areas and extremely walkable, and we took advantage of that.  Parking can be tough on street cleaning mornings, but otherwise was pretty easy.  Elizabeth and William were also kind enough to message me to remind me about the street cleaning.  Totally appreciated the heads-up.<br/><br/>Elizabeth & Williams are clearly not only thoughtful, but pay great attention to detail.  The sheets were soft as can be, the mini fridge was filled with bottles of water, a Keurig coffee machine is available in your room (as well as a wine opener, scissors, lots of hangers, shampoo, a hair dryer, etc.) and when the people leaving the day I was arriving checked out early, they offered me a very early check-in, and were flexible on my later checkout request.   I highly recommend this listing.",clean

Thanks for having us!!",location
It was very easy to communicate with them by text or email and their directions were clear and helpful. The space itself was beautiful and the pool and the outdoor fireplace were great. The coffee and snacks were a nice touch too. ,location
"Elizabeth was very warm and welcoming and responsive to our requests. Initially the room was a bit warm for our taste and renters don't have access to the thermostat, so when we requested that she make it cooler she did so right away and then checked back in with us later to make sure we were comfortable. The property is beautiful and we enjoyed 24 hr access to the pool and jacuzzi. Elizabeth brought us some nice wine one evening which we enjoyed by the pool, but otherwise we had total privacy, which was much appreciated. She was also thoughtful enough to remind us of the parking restrictions on the block the night before (no parking on the opposite side of the street Wednesdays 8-10 am). I had seen the signs but appreciated the reminder - no one wants to wake up to a towed rental car in Los Angeles! The neighborhood is very convenient to Griffith Park, Silverlake, and Hollywood. Really enjoyed our stay and I'd love to return. ",location
"We had a wonderful stay! Very clean and beautiful room and property. They had everything we could have possibly needed including a fridge with water, hygiene essentials, a cute basket with snacks and Emergen-C, Kuerig machine with coffee and tea.

Very cosy, clean and private. Hot tub could be used even until very late. Neighbourhood was pretty and calm and I felt sucure even coming home late walking along the streets. There are some cute bars and restaurants right away. The beach  is about 5 min. away, easy and not crowded. <br/>A very comfortable stay and a pleasure to have meat Nicole and Brian. <br/>Nicoles first house rule is: Enjoy your stay and have a good time.

Although I never got to meet Nicole, she made sure to make me and my friend feel at home. If I ever needed anything, she always made sure it was tended to. I met her adorable dog Moomoo, who liked to keep me company from time to time which was very nice. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to get a nice break from madness. The one downfall, the bed was so comfortable that it was hard to actually go and enjoy the cali weather :-) <br/><br/>I would recommend this place to anyone!",clean
"Nicole was the best host.  I never had the chance to meet her.  But she was always responsive to my messages & always checking in to see if I needed anything.

My friends kept bragging to other people at the wedding, telling them our place was better than their hotel (& these were nice hotels). I'm glad we didn't stay at a hotel..    To tell you about the home/apt..  It was better than expected!   The bed was more comfortable than a 5 Star hotel bed.  The Pool was the best part!!  After a day of shopping, sight seeing & drinking it was nice to relax for an hour in the pool.. The neighborhood is extremely nice.. Every morning we walked to CafÃ© Milan's for Breakfast, which I highly recommend.   The location was perfect & close by all the beaches.. We Ubered everywhere (cheap) from Manhattan, Redondo, Venice, & Hermosa.   One of the best days we had was on a Saturday.. We ate lunch, shopped in Manhattan beach, then rented bikes.. We did a mini pub crawl from Manhattan Beach to Redondo Pier & back.. It was a blast!  ",host

Good apartment and location. Everything that we needed from towels to appliances was provided.

Really good experience. Great location and excellent value for a Southern California trip. We would definitely choose to stay here again.,location
Everything was clean. The beds were comfortable and it was a nice size space. I love the hardwood floor in the apartment. You can tell the hostess does the bare minimum. Funtiure is cheap and uncomfortable needs to be replaced. Microwave is so old needs to be updated. You might find like 2 plates and a spoon. It was only 3 towels and 1 wash cloth. We didn't get anything extra to help accommodate our trip. Plan to go to Walmart when you arrive. It's only 1 mirror in the entire apartment and it's in the bathroom. That suck for us because it was a girls trip. It took us hours to get ready each morning. Walmart got cheap mirrors you can hang in the rooms. We couldn't even see our entire outfits before we left out. That was a big thumbs down. She sent check out direction so late that we got them while we were on the airplane going home. The apartment is ok in a ok neighborhood. The hostess needs to do a little bit more just to make it comfortable for her guest.,clean
Perfect if needing to be close to LAX,location

"This place was perfect for my little family. We was able to celebrate Xmas even tho we were temporarily out of our home. Even tho our reservations was last minute, they were still able to accommodate us.",location
"The place was as described. Jackie communicated check-in and check-out information in a timely manner. Overall, our stay went well. I think this place is best for large parties- we initially were meant to have four and when it was just 3 it felt a bit too big for what we needed. <br/><br/>On our second night there, at about 10pm, two men and a woman knocked on the door claiming to have reservations to the place through another site.  They had the same pictures of the place and the same contact phone number,  I attempted calling Jackeline multiple times and messaged her with no response. They looked tired and seemed as confused as I was, they even came back two times after. Thankfully, they were understanding people and the situation did not escalate however I did not hear back from Jackeline for about 12 hours. In a short message she explained said she had lost her phone, that there was no other listing of the place and apologized for the inconvenience.  I found this frustrating as I would expect a host to be checking their email via other devices if their phone is not working and because I essentially had to navigate a booking dispute late at night with a stranger which was uncomfortable and made me concerned for my family's safety while the situation was happening. I did hear back from Jackie once more detailing check out instructions. <br/>Overall, an OK place if you are not in need of special accommodations or have an unexpected situation. ",location
"Great place, looks exactly like the pictures. It gets a bit cold at night, so I did wish there were thicker blankets on the beds. Also, the microwave didnât work very well which was a bit inconvenient. However, the home was very clean and comfortable to stay in. The location is very convenient, and the WiFi works great as long as you donât have too many people online at once. I would definitely stay here again! The neighborhood is very quiet and the home is near several useful shopping plazas. Parking spot was a HUGE plus!",clean
"It was a cute little space perfect for me my mom, and my two cousins. The rooms were perfect. The bathroom was great. The kitchen had everything for the morning coffee. It was a perfect weekend stay.",location
"Our host Laura has been so responsive since we first made the booking. Although there were some minor hiccups during check in (she mistakenly gave us the house key), we still enjoy our stay there for 1 week. Kitchen facilities is superb, we used everything that weee provided, which of course saves us a lot on our food budget. The house is clean and wifi is super fast. Overall for the price and facilities provided, it is a no brainer. Highly recommended to all.",clean
good  clean place with a great location,clean
"Great place! She was very responsive and we did not have any problems. We had a group of 8 and we fit perfectly! Only complaint would be one of the couches that was a little dirty. Other than that, everything was very clean.",clean
"the place was cool. needed better WiFi, needed hand soap, and paper towels. great communication with the owner though.",clean
This unit was perfect for my family who came from out of town. The apartment is located on a nice street and includes a parking spot. We would definitely recommend this place for large groups.,location
"Very cozy, recommend to small familyâs :)",clean
Great little place!  Just as described.  It was perfect for our little group of 3,location
A comfortable place conveniently located near LAX. Good for small families or small group of friends traveling leisurely.,location
Great place near the airport. Good spot for groups. Very quiet at night and the curtains block out much of the light so we slept very well.,location
Our experience at Jackline's place was just what we expected.... It was good! The neighbors are friendly while the neighborhood is quiet and good for walking in free time. The space  had everything we needed and Jackline responded to all of our questions in a decent amount of time. It was a great choice. I would stay again!,clean
"Elizabeth happened to be outside upon arrival and warmly greeted us. The unit was just as expected and the basket with goodies was a nice touch as well as the drinks that were available. The pool was fantastic and a great place to read a book. Elizabeth was available to adjust the room temp when we asked. Overall, great stay and host. ",location
"The place was very nice.  The room was small, but worked fine for just us two.  The pool area was very nice.  It was very close to everything we wanted to do, but the traffic in LA was the worst!!! 15-20 minutes just to go a couple miles down the road.  The hosts were nice and was very prompt with any requests.  Just be careful not to let the cats out when you open the gate!  I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.",location
"It was our first Airbnb experience and we wonder if we got the best hosts out there! So easy, answered any questions within minutes and it's a beautiful, quiet room! The yard and the pool were amazing. The extra snacks and wine were so appreciated. It was very relaxing, quiet and exactly what we needed after an exhausting convention. Thank you for everything-we will be back next time we're in CA!",location
"Everything about my stay here went smoothly. Elizabeth was very proactive in making sure all my needs were met and provided detailed instructions for everything. The place was immaculately clean and plush. The water and snacks provided were a nice extra touch. I've lived in LA for 4 years and if you want to experience the city the way Angelenos do, this is the place to be. Highly recommended!",clean
"Their place was super cool. Should have stayed there longer. You might share the backyard space with other guests, but it they are nice, then that could be a plus. It is such a unique place in a great neighborhood in Los Angeles. The big, comfortable bed was also appreciated.",location
"Our children's nanny stayed with Nicole, and she loved it. Great place. Clean. Quiet and friendly. Nicole was very prompt in answering questions we had. Would definitely stay here again if it were available!",clean
Nicole and Bryan were both welcoming and accommodating. The place was as advertised and a clean and lovely studio. The neighborhood was beautiful and quiet. Very close to the beach,location
Everything was perfect ! Nicol was really helpful ! The house is just amazing! Near the beach and shops ,location
In a word - perfect. Private Hot tub & pool steps outside your private entrance in the back. GREAT bed albeit a touch low for my hockey- damaged knees. But mattress better than the 5 star hotel I'm in now. Great street parking right in front. BEST Westside/South Bay locay near everything you need in morning or night. My only regret is I did not get to meet Nicole who was SUPER helpful. I'm coming back for sure. ,location
"Nicole was just fantastic. She went out of her way to ensure our stay would be the best it could be. The property was great, the description was spot on. What it doesn't say is all the lovely personal touches that have been incorporated. The location to the beach is great too!",location
"Nicole was a great host from the very start. We arrived late in the evening and she made accommodations for us (left the lights on, gave detailed instructions, etc.) so our arrival was as smooth as possible. The location is great, right by the beach. The pool/hot tub situation is great. And parking is very available. Thank you Nicole for a great stay!",location
Really lovely location with great walks along the seafront & marina/nature reserve. So quiet we found it hard to believe we were in LA! Nice neighbourhood. Great views. Very comfortable accommodation (the bed was amazing!) and the pool area was really relaxing. Nicole was a great host who kept in touch and responded really promptly to any issues even though she was in a different country! Very kind and considerate.,location
"My wife and I stayed at Nicole's place for 2 days over the weekend. What a lovely stay we had! Their pool and jacuzzi are pretty awesome as well as private and the apartment was everything we needed and more. The bed was very comfortable and sheets and towels and pretty much everything you need was in the linen closet. Iron and board available and fast wifi! Kitchen was well equipped and snacks and a welcome card made us feel very welcome into LA. I really appreciated the ""beach"" theme and it really matched the area as there is an awesome beach a few minutes walk away. The restaurants in the area were delicious and if you flew into LAX, it's only a 20min drive or uber ride to and from. Perfect place and would definitely stay here again! Thanks again, Nicole! ",clean
Our stay was very good ;)<br/>Nicole was welcoming and made us feel at home. The house is close to the airport and close to the famous beaches : good location. <br/>I recommend to spend some days at this house ! ,location
A most relaxing place...especially falling off a long international flight late at light.  We are already recommending it to our friends,location
The apartment was just as described and Nicole's hospitality was exceptional! Our time spent there was better than expected. I definitely recommend it!,clean
"This place is as-advertised, a great place to work or relax near the beach. Pool is a great bonus, and Nicole was a thoughtful host. Hope to stay again soon!",location
"Nicole's place was exactly as described. The yard area was a really nice and unique bonus! The neighborhood is quiet, which was great to retreat to after spending time in Venice and Santa Monica. I was pleasantly surprised by a few of the local (within walking distance) dining options - we had some really great meals! We never did meet Nicole, but the timing of her check-ins was perfect. Some reviews mentioned the bed being super comfy and it is if you like a very soft mattress, but we found it difficult to get in and out of - it feels kind of like a waterbed - and is located very low to the ground, so if you have any limitations this would not be a good option for you. Overall we were very happy with the place!",location
"We loved Nicole's place, it was such a great place to stay, I fully recommend it. The hot tub, pool and views were brilliant.  Nicole was really nice, helpful and welcoming and gave great advice about the wonderful local tapas restaurant. ",location
All went well. Great location. Quiet and private. Thanks Nicole..,location
"Simply perfect. Location was great for anywhere you need to go in LA. My husband and I stayed at Nicole's place for three nights last week to celebrate our anniversary and couldn't have been happier. It is exactly as described and as seen in the photos. Nicole even left us an anniversary card and roses upon arrival--very lovely. No issue parking and be sure to take in the view of Marina Del Rey from the street. Absolutely beautiful. And the bed is straight from heaven. My husband sleeps in 2 hour increments normally. He slept 9-10 solid hours each night and was amazed. I'm now trying to find that mattress topper for our bed. Thank you again, Nicole, for such a great place to stay!",location
"This listing looked exactly as described. One thing I didn't think to check was whether or not the unit had AC but it didn't end up mattering anyways because I was out most of the day. You can chill by the pool if you're really warm but nighttime and morning I had no problems with the temp and everything about the listing was identical to the pictures which everyone knows isn't always the case. Had a great experience here, the view is perfect and just close enough to all of West LA while maintaining a quiet enough location to where you can hear the birds chirping in the morning moreso than any city noise.",location
Great area -- many great restaurants and amazing beach within walking.<br/>Loved the pool and room -- felt like like a private weekend bungalow.,location
"Can't fault her place. It's beautiful, she is easy to communicate with, the studio is in a convenient location (proximity to airport, restaurants and beach), she left snacks and lots of teas, the view is amazing, as with all Playa Del Rey properties in this area, nice little pool and comfortable bed. One critique if you can call it that is that I think the TV was brand new and therefore wasnt hooked up. Also no remote. But I didn't mind as I wasn't here to sit in the house and watch TV all day long so I didn't miss that! <br/><br/>Absolutely recommend this place for your next stay in LA. I love Playa Del Rey, such a cute little sleepy village. Maybe I'm biased because I used to live here!",location
Phenomenal ,location
Beautiful apartment - great outdoor space and lovely neighborhood. Little touches in the apartment really made you feel at home. Friendly host with good communication,location
"One of the best AirB&B's. Heated pool, amazing hot and bubbly jacuzzi, lots of space to sit and enjoy the Cali weather. Only stayed one night but wish I lived at this house that seems like a resort. The cozy room and bed were comfortable and Bathroom had lots of modem touches. Would definitely consider staying again for a longer length of time.",location
"Elizabeth was easy to work with throughout the process.  The house is located in a great location, nestled between Los Feliz and Silverlake- ideal accessibility to our downtown wedding.  While the flat itself was quite small, it was fine to just sleep at night.  It was also very clean and the fixtures were updated.  Elizabeth had everything provided in the room from a small fridge to coffee to lotion, pool towels and a hair dryer. The pool/outdoor area is serene and private- helped us to cool off during the hot summer days.  We enjoyed the stay and appreciated the responsiveness of the host!",clean
"My wife and I stayed in the Flat for four nights and loved it. The check-in was very smooth, the room very good but the real kicker was the pool area. Staying in a large, busy city like LA and have a backyard like that makes all the difference. Also, we loved the neighborhood. You could walk to tons of good stores, cafes and restaurants. All in all, we would recommend staying with Elizabeth and William any day. ",location
"We stayed with my children and brother (5 guests). The location is very convenient to Manhattan Beach/El Segundo (10-15 min on a Friday night) and I think it took us only 35-40 minutes to Santa Monica/Will Rogers Beach. ALDI and a Mexican grocery store are very close for shopping needs as is Target.  We had some personal business in LA and spent a lot of time in the apartment due to being tired from road travel.  The value is good, itâs nothing fancy but it is comfortable. Note that the walls between the two bedrooms are very thin. It didnât matter for us, but just for awareness.",location
"This is a great location in a really nice neighborhood. It's a short walk to the beach where there are several restaurants. The neighborhood is hilly but we didn't find that a drawback at all. We didn't use the pool since it isn't heated but we used the hot tub every day which was nice. The kitchen is well supplied with dishes, etc. if you want to prepare food. The bed was very comfortable. Even though the host was out of town during our visit, we were in constant communication with her. She had a plan in case we had any problems which we didn't. All in all, a great apartment in a great location!",location
We enjoyed our comfy apartment and the pool area outside our door. The local neighborhood restaurants and beach were great. It was easy to hop in the car and head to many LA sights. ,location
"The place was just as described. Amazing location, walkable to beach, shops and restaurants. The host Nicole was very helpful and flexible with check-in/out. I highly recommend this property if you are looking for a relaxing getaway in a great neighborhood. ",location
Great choice! I could not have asked for a better experience. This place is breathtakingly beautiful and Nicole is absolutely amazing! So kind and thoughtful. She definitely goes above and beyond to make her guests feel welcomed. Will be back for sure. ,location
Amazing space and location!! Great to have a pool and jacuzzi directly outside of the room. Location couldn't be more perfect; steps away from the beach. Nicole was super nice and accommodating with our last minute check in. Would definitely book again.,location
"I really enjoyed the zen vibe, it was just what I needed at the end of my business trip. The hot tub was so relaxing and the bedding was amazing. I felt cozy and safe in the studio and neighborhood. I was also able to uber around and to the airport within a few minutes making it the perfect location! Nicole was a great host replying to all my texts within minutes. She had a  personal note on the counter upon my arrival along with a few snacks and coffee for the morning which was truly appreciated. Mahalo! and Aloha!",location
"Nicole's place was amazing,  it was our first trip to LA and our first time using Air BnB so we were not sure what to think.  Our flight arrived late and Nicole sent instructions to me by email and told me not to worry as everything was ready. We really enjoyed the tranquility of the suit.  So close to the beaches and airport.  The pool and spa was the icing on the cake as we kicked back in our own oasis to relax after a long day of sightseeing.  If there was 10 stars I would give it to Nicole. My wife and son are already talking about our next trip and I will be sure to book Nicole's place before I book my flights. Thanks Nicole for the unforgettable holiday. John Smith ",location
"Nicole's apartment is the perfect Playa del Rey escape.  The pool and hot tub are amazing amenities. The weather was perfect when we visited, so we spent a full day lazing by the pool. <br/><br/>The apartment itself is great. Super cozy, clean and comfortable, it looks exactly as it does in the pictures. And the bed is just as comfortable as other reviewers have claimed. <br/><br/>Beautiful Playa del Rey is a 3 minute walk from the apartment. As are a number of terrific restaurants. Excellent location.  <br/><br/>Nicole is a superb host. Leading up to our visit, she was communicative and very helpful.  She was there upon our arrival, too, and had tons of recommendations in the area. Couldn't have asked for a better, more welcoming host. <br/><br/>All in all, one of our favorite Airbnb experiences ever.  Thanks, Nicole!",location
Great stay! Excellent host and awesome place!,location
"Great place and location! Having a pool and hot tub and walking to the beach were great. We rented bikes and rode to Venice and Santa Monica on a great bike trail. Hosts were kind, available, and responsive. ",location
"I brought my niece to California for some R&R. We loved staying in this private studio apartment. It's truly a zen oasis with the pool and hot tub right outside your door. Very comfortable, relaxing, private and close to everything. The sunsets were breathtaking and there's a great little restaurant that's a small walk down the hill. We would stay again. Highly recommend A++",location
"Great place, great host",location
"Nicole and Brian communicated with me throughout my whole stay.  I was moving my daughter during the time I stayed there, so I didn't spend much time there. They were always quick to respond. The backyard is lovely, unfortunately I did not get to enjoy the pool or hot tub. There was street parking available too. The bed was comfortable too.  Thank you!",clean
"Lovely 2 weeks in Playa del Ray. Most chilled area of LA I have stayed to date, but several good eating options. Beach a short walk and the view from the balcony is outstanding.  Nicole is a 5-star hostess - lots of lovely touches on arrival (limes !) and regular check-ins to make sure I was feeling at home. Room clean, self-contained & with al you could need. Enjoyed it all. ",location
"We loved staying at Nicole's place! Everything was perfect. The apartment was very tidy and had everything we needed. The pool was an extra special treat. Nicole was so friendly and kind, and always available for questions, giving us many great recommendations. The location was perfect for us, as our son lives nearby and the home was a short walk to the most beautiful beach. Truly, an oasis in Los Angeles! We can't wait to stay here again! Thank you Nicole for making our trip extra special.",location
"We stayed at Tristan's room for two weeks, while he was on a trip. The room was spacious and quiet, and it was fairly clean. The only con is that the windows had no curtains, so we would wake up with the sun and ended up hanging some towels on the windows to get some privacy. The apartment is a two bedroom with a nice living room and a spacious kitchen that had everything needed to cook and eat. We also got some fridge space. The area was great, with easy access to grocery stores and very well connected via bus. The 207 bus takes you up and down Wilshire and connects with the Purple and Red lines (subway). And the 4 bus, on Sta Monica Blvd, takes you to Silver Lake and also to a Red line stop. Overall, or stay in this room was awesome. Oh, and his roommate was super nice.",clean
The place was perfect for my family of four. We were very comfortable staying at Jackeline's place.,location
Great stay! Close to airport,location
I would recommend staying at Jackelines place for an air bnb. The place was decorated nice and very clean when we got in there. The only thing that did bother me was people were parked in our parking spot the whole time we stayed there so we had to find parking on the street. But other than that it was a nice and peaceful stay!,clean
Cute place. Just as pictured. Great location. Close to everything you need. Jackeline is a  great host.,location
"The host was extremely kind and worked around my vacation to allow me to check in early and check out late. The apartment is great, quiet, and worth every penny. Super close to LAX and only about a 30 minute drive from Hollywood.",location
This place was awesome. It was perfect for staying a few nights and had great things around.,location
"A really great host wish we wouldâve know the washer was broken before we got there had trouble with the WiFi pretty much the whole time , right near everything close to lax not the beaches just a couple places to eat very nice in the inside the pictures do NOT serve it justice what so ever loved the unit ! Wish we couldâve stayed longer lol . Very active and in olives host loud neighbors and very rude ones as well . Next door neighbors were very loud and smoking , back door doesnât locked so we were concerned about that especially being in the neighborhood. Overall the inside was beautiful and we loved it",location
Elizabeth is amazing host. Communication was fast and easy. Every question or problem was solved very quick. We enjoyed every minute at our stay. The flat is as described and very beautiful. The pool and the garden in the back are awesome and a great place to relax. ,location
"Prior to arriving I received excellent directions and was able to get into the property without any problems. Description was accurate, space was beautiful. Did not meet the host but was able to communicate via message. Bathroom is stocked with essentials. Small fridge was very helpful and there was water available. Coffee maker, plates, napkins, and plastic flatware also available as well as bottle opener and corkscrew.<br/>Amazing pool and jacuzzi/ spa area. Lots of space to lounge and relax.<br/>Would highly recommend!",clean
The location and accommodations were excellent. Everything was as promised at booking.,location
"Great place, close to almost everything. was a little bit smaller than expected but the location made it well worth it. Parking was a bit of an issue on Wednesdays and Fridays because of the bi-weekly cleaning of the streets, other than that we had a fantastic stay!",location

"This Airbnb experience was great! Once we arrived, it truly did feel an oasis. The room we stayed in was very close to the other guests but we didn't really mind- might be a concern for someone else though.<br/><br/>This place is beautifully clean and well equipped and the yard is a wonderful place to hang out and relax.<br/><br/>We were in town to go to a concert at the Greek Theater and this place was perfectly located to go for dinner and then to the theater. In fact, we skipped all the traffic and walked back, which was really nice.<br/>",location
Private oasis on a quiet street in a great walkable area in L.A.'s Los Feliz neighborhood. ,location

Great location very near Sofi stadium.  Easy access to everything we needed.,location
Nice place to stay with family.,location
"Where do i start? Check in was amazing, the location to EVERYTHING was perfect. The place was very comfy, and clean! She accommodated all we needed. If it had 2 bathrooms it would be perfect ð. If I had to say anything bad at all it would be that the dryer didn't work well we had to dry our clothes 3 rounds to dry them,  but there are a ton of laundromats in the area so we just took it there and dried them. Overall  I'd definitely come back! Thank you Jackie for everything.",clean
A nice spot for a few days exploring LA. The location seemed nice and quiet. A simple checkin and easy parking. It ticked the boxes for our needs at a competitive price,location
The host canceled this reservation 9 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.,clean

And Nick & Greg, They are very nice and friendly guys with whom you can talk and help you have a good stay .. incrible place! ",clean
"This little studio apartment is in a beautiful, secluded location in the Hollywood Hills. The photos in the listing don't to justice to the wooded location, nor can they can convey the serenity of the setting.<br/><br/>The apartment itself seems quite spacious despite it's small footprint due to the high ceiling and large bathroom. The bed is comfortable and is covered with a very nice down comforter, which keeps you toasty on cool nights. The property is very clean and well maintained.<br/><br/>Radu made me feel welcome and was attentive and helpful both prior to and throughout my stay. When I'm in the area again, I hope this space will be available!",location
The tree is pretty goodï¼,clean

"The Treehouse was PERFECT. This was our first time in Los Angeles - the location is great, their home is cozy and decorated in detail, and the cats were the best part! Highly recommended, best AirBnb experience I've had (though only a handful to compare to).",location
"This place was great! It was very comfortable, located centrally, and Nick and Greg gave good recommendations of places to go in the neighborhood.",location
"The treehouse is marvelous! Nick and Greg went above and beyond, and their cats are two of the nicest I've known. Very polite and cuddly! The location is fantastic, the description is accurate, the hosting is thorough, the place has everything. And the extremely nearby LACMA is amazing---just last night I stumbled upon free jazz outside! I hope to return. Thanks for everything! ",location
Nick and Greg were the perfect hosts from start to finish. Their place has more character than most neighborhoods do combined. Their two kitties were super friendly and made the stay feel even cozier. I would happily stay here again!,host
"Very accommodating host. Nice place in a good, central area. Would book again. ",location
The location is good but the apt was a little bit mess and there was a whole at the door of the bathroom. Neighbors are good but sometimes are noise.,clean
Good location with parking nice neighbor's. I was celebrating my birthday thank you for the balloons. Easy to get an uber and lyft and close to Hollywood and downtown areas and Universal Studios wasn't that far through the highway good location.,location
"I could not have wished for anything better. The house is perfect in every detail, super clean and beautiful, even better than the pictures if that is possibile! And that is not even the best part, Wes and Dennis are the great gift. They are just the perfect hosts, they are going to help you with all that they can even before you ask then. Wes welcomed me, showed me around the house and gave me some indications on the neighbourhood. He is the sweetest person, together with Dennis who instantly responded to any request during my stay! I instantly felt at home, and that is a lot to say when you are so far away from home! The house has plenty of room and a beautiful terrace. There is all the space you need if you want to be on your own, the house is vey quiet; but at the same time you can socialise in the common areas if you like. The neighbourhood is just the perfect fit both if you are visiting the city or if you are here for work. West Hollywood is in the middle of it all, and it is very easy to get anywhere from here, from North Hollywood to downtown. It is walking distance from Melrose avenue, which offers you the opportunity to take a walk and also, very rare in Los Angeles, there is plenty of street parking. This place is just the perfect place in the perfect part of the city with the perfect hosts. I stayed for a month and even if I think hard there is just nothing I would have changed about my stay. I just feel like saying Thankyou to Wes and Dennis for making my stay so pleasant, I am going to miss them and I am already so jealous of all the people that are going to stay with them. I am definitely going to be back here when I come back to LA because there is just no place I'd rather be!",clean
"Radu was a very good host. When we arrived he had a big bowl of fresh apples for us and a bottle of juice in the fridge (because we don't drink alcohol) He had printed out everything we needed to know for the neighbourhood and for the guest house.<br/>The room is as described, although the kitchenette is small, once we figured out meals we could cook we were fine!<br/>The bathroom is massive and shower pressure is incredible!<br/>There's lots of space for parking and the neighbourhood is beautiful!",clean
"Radu's place is really incredible, good location, in the matter of fact, near everything, near Hollywood and Beverly Hills and Mulholland Drive yet very peaceful place. You are in the hills with squirrels! The studio is neat and very affordable, with own parking place and yard to enjoy in. Really great experience and we recommend it to everyone. Radu is very good host and was very helpful. One more thing, Laurel Canyon is magic place and Laurel Canyon Country Store is amazing place to start your day with, good coffee, great smoothies, wonderful people.<br/>We had really great time.<br/>Thank you again Radu! ",location
"Radu  was a great host. The place is close to all the big attractions (e.g. Hollywood blvd, Hollywood sign, sunset blvd). Very close to a ton of bars and places to eat. Absolutely beautiful place in a somewhat secluded area.  Comfortable bed, big shower, enough closet space. Will definitely be using him for future stays in the area. He accommodated a late arrival and even let us check out a bit later than most places allow you too",location
Radu's place is great! Being in the Hollywood Hills makes it seem like you're in a secluded cabin yet you're literally minutes from anywhere in Hollywood. It's cozy and has everything you need.,location
"Our host met us at the set time and date, walked us through and provided the key with some information.  There was a bottle of wine and keurig with kcups, as well as a microwave, toaster, fridge, tv with dvd player as well as some videos.  Also available for our use was a washer and dryer which was perfect since we were there for a couple of weeks.  Host was always available to provide any needed assistance or answer any questions.  If you value privacy this place is perfect, secluded in Laurel Canyon yet only a couple of miles from the center of Hollywood Boulevard and Sunset strip.  The place had everything I believe you would require for a relaxing time.  The studio had a full size bed, nightstand, wardrobe as well as a sofa and coffee table, the bathroom was great, large room with good size shower, great water pressure, oversize sink, as well as towels.  There was also a sink and cabinets where there were kitchen utensils for your use.<br/>Although we only slept and showered there and were out and about most of the day we felt quite comfortable and host could not have been any more hospitable.<br/>Would definitely stay again if we were to be back in the area.",location
"We had a great time staying at Radu's. He was very communicative about check in and gave good directions to his place. The unit was comfortable and a really great value, and is in a fun neighborhood.",location
Cool spot in the hills. Not far from sunset. Easy to uber at night. Old movie posters on the wall. Really felt like I was staying in part of Hollywood. The area is unparalleled for a jog in the evening. <br/>Radu wasn't there but was quick to respond to the couple questions I had about the TV. He also let me send a couple packages to the address which arrived the day before. <br/>Excellent location and accommodating host. Will definitely stay again as my first choice when back in LA!,location
Radu has a nice place in the Hollywood Hills. That also means that you should have a car. A lot of touristic sights are very close. <br/><br/>The place was clean and nice. I would recommend this place to everyone to experience housing in an actual resident area. If you drive up Radu's road till the end you get a great view of LA.,location
"Great small unit up in the hills. Located near the essentials for an l.a trip. However if you plan more time near the beach, the location is a bit far due to l.a traffic. The only thing I may mention is that the unit was a bit warm even with the window and fan. An air conditioner would be great. Radu is a great welcoming host. Answered any questions within a couple hours. I do recommend.",location
"Radu's apartment in Laurel Canyon was perfect for my parents to use while they came to visit. It's cozy, nicely decorated, and definitely close to Hollywood and LA-proper! And its location just up the hill from the Laurel Canyon store was great for late-night snack runs! Check-in was really easy, and Radu was great to communicate with via email beforehand. I'm recommending this spot to my girlfriend's parents when they come to town next!",location
"Radu was an excellent host showing us around the studio when we arrived. Loads of maps of the area provided which was very useful. Inside the studio was spacious, very clean, and comfortable. The location was perfect for exploring Hollywood and downtown la. Very safe and quiet location ",location
Great location.  Cozy place.  Plenty of parking.  Cool Hollywood vibe.  Radu is a very friendly and accommodating host.,location
Randy was very helpful and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. The location was great and close to all the areas we wanted to see. ,location
"Radu's place is great. It's up in the hills so you can't stay there without a car, but it's close to everything if you've got a set of wheels. It's small but efficient, really everything you need. Radu was really helpful and easy to deal with. Thanks!",location
"We enjoyed the place although it was quite warm in the room. However, the location is accessible to many stores and also near from Hollywood Boulevard. The host was very accommodating.",location
"Although I didn't get to meet the host, his service and studio apartment was spic and span and had a comfortable stay. The neighbourhood was calm and the studio is situated on the hill that makes it scenic. ",location
Had a comfortable stay at this great location in the hills only a few minutes from the Sunset strip yet quiet location with plenty of places to see and trails to walk. Would definitely stay again if I'm in town. Radu was great in explaining the place and helpful with any queries I had. ,location
"Awesome place in the hills, can't ask for better. Want to cm bk again n spend a few more days with my girlfriend. Top class stay.",location
"Wow! What a gem of a place. This was another great Airbnb experience that makes me certain I'll never stay in a hotel again. Elizabeth was a wonderful host, provided so many thoughtful amenities, and communicated promptly both before and during our stay. <br/>You'd never guess from the street what an oasis lies in the backyard of this property. It's truly a beautiful escape. We loved listening to the fountain (which provide good ambient noise for when the guests across the way were out and about) and sitting on the beautifully landscaped back patio by the pool. <br/>The coffee and tea machine in the flat was ideal (with a supply of K cups), along with the mini frig which was stocked with water. There were cups, plastic utensils and lots of assorted toiletries in the event you didn't bring shampoo or sunscreen. <br/>The neighborhood is also lovely, and well situated for both exploring on foot and getting to nearby attractions such as the Griffith observatory. <br/>Tip: fly into Burbank and save yourself a lot of traffic hassle. We were able to travel to and from the airport in less than 20 minutes. <br/>Thanks for a great getaway!<br/><br/>",location
Elizabeth & William were fantastic hosts.  Their location is beautiful and very relaxing.  The bed was very comfortable (made for a great sleep).<br/><br/>They provided coffee and some snacks (which was very thoughtful).  Having a morning coffee on the sun chairs was particularly nice for a Canadian like me.<br/><br/>Elizabeth was super responsive.  I had a question about checking in and she responded in under 5 min.<br/><br/>I would love to stay here again soon.,location
This place is awesome - feels like a mini resort with all the amenities. Walking distance to some great places to eat and cool nightlife. Highly recommend!,location
"We loved our stay here! It has everything we were looking for. Comfy bed, close to Uber to all of the attractions and nightlife that we wanted, quaint and beautiful backyard with a pool and hot tub & some bonuses like complimentary water & snacks! We met Elizabeth briefly and she was very nice! If you want a resort feel a skip away from the heart of a city then stay here!",location
"This is my second time and it is great.  The place is cozy, has everything you need and more and is in an awesome location. The pool and hot tub and back yard with table, chairs lounge area are all great. Thanks!",location
"We stayed in both the flat and the cottage, the flat was much more accommodating. Modern, really comfy bed and the bath tub was amazing. The cottage was smaller than we thought and very close to the flat. The whole place was nice and quiet and the snacks included were a nice surprise. However, when we checked out of the flat to move over to the cottage the host asked if we wanted her to clean it or should we move over straight away?! We chose for it to be cleaned! Apart from that, the host seemed nice, and the garden with the log fire was so romantic. It felt like an escape from the world however on a few occasions, the moment was spoilt as the host  cleaned the outdoor furniture next to us and spent time walking around us to ""observe"" their cats that keep escaping. Host didn't really ask how we were getting on or if we were enjoying the place on those times but emailed us a message complaining about the hot tub that was left on a low temp and about the heat lamps being left on. It would have been nice to have been spoken to directly instead of the email. It made us feel slightly uncomfortable, as were very respectful of the property. The heat lamps were not working when we arrived, and after emailing the host we were told one wasn't working therefore I can only presume there was a fault with the lamps and it wasn't us. Also we weren't the only guests using the hot tub. When we arrived and used it it was set on a low setting but we just pressed the button and moved it up a notch. Very simple and it heated up fast. The music system was great and we added a play list in the garden as there wasn't a notice to say we couldn't use it, therefore this was a nice addition to the holiday :)  The area was nice and quiet and very close to lots of restaurants, Griffith Park and Magic Mountain. I would recommend for one or two nights only due to how small the rooms are, however we enjoyed the area and the pool. Thank you for letting us stay!",clean
"This is a great place to stay, can't wait to go back again! The room, pool, jacuzzi & grounds were exactly as the pictures showed. Quiet & relaxing neighborhood, coffee each morning poolside, easy street parking & the hosts were easy to get a hold of and very responsive. One of the best Airbnb's we've stayed at. ",location

Really nice and quite place to spend five days with my friend here. Strongly recommend! ,location
"Elizabeth and William's oasis flat was very pleasant and situated behind their main house. The entire location shows pride of ownership as seen in all the intricate details of their interior and exterior property. I loved how the flat was well stocked with toiletries and items that are frequently forgotten during travel. The bed was very comfortable and the ""zen "" environment was the perfect setting for a restful stay after a very long busy day.  And their cats are adorable.  Thanks Elizabeth!",location
"We loved or stay here! Everything was as described in the listing. The whole property was clean and cozy. The scent of the flat was really good! Loved the hot tub as well. Didn't meet the owners but were very responsive and helpful. Saw one of their cats and was able to pet it, very friendly! Would recommend this place to anyone. Thanks! :)",clean
My husband and I came to LA for the first time with a 4 month old to attend a wedding. This was our first exerience with Airbnb and did not disappoint. We stayed 6 nights and  Elizabeth and William's place was a beautiful and relaxing spot that provided everything we needed during our stay. Elizabeth was lovely and more than accommodating to provide everything we needed. A great host and an amazing trip. We will definitely recommend this place to friends and family visiting LA in the future. ,host

Great location more Silver Lake than Los Feliz but easy walking to a few things and fun neighborhood to walk.<br/>Very private space ,location
This place is a perfect location to enjoy all LA has to offer but also come back to the space and relax.  The pool and jacuzzi area made our stay an unforgettable experience Thanks so much for having us and letting us check in a little early....we thoroughly enjoyed our stay,location

"Lovely experience.  On our short stay we enjoyed a deep and pleasant sleep, coffee by the pool side in the morning, and the peaceful setting.  I went for a run and in addition to busy Los Angeles streets, I was able to experience the sanctuary of and view from the top of Barnsdall Park. It's a unique location and we loved it.",location
"This is a lovely unit in an absolutely beautiful setting in a great neighborhood that is terrific for walking, dining, and shopping. Elizabeth communicated with me when I booked and a few times before my stay. She reminded me of parking constraints which prevented a parking ticket (much appreciated). The unit was clean, well-equipped and as described.  <br/><br/>The ""flat"" is a bedroom with bathroom and I had been expecting a small apartment. This isn't the host's fault as I likely didn't read the description as carefully as I should have.  It was a bit tight but we managed. I would return.<br/><br/>The cats are adorable.",clean
"Great hosts, everything was an EXACT match to the property description.  There was even cold beer in the mini fridge in the flat.  Would stay here again on my next visit. Never saw a cat, but would have liked to.",clean

"Everything went smooth from check-in to check-out. Great place to stay in West Hollywood. Our room was on the top floor with access to terrace which was very nice. Wes, our host, was very welcoming and responsive to all our questions. We even had our own parking spot which saved us a lot of time trying to park on the street. Thanks for everything.",clean
"So short, so sweet. Dennis' place is beautiful and he is such an easy going person. The place feels secure, is on the cusp of West Hollywood and central to most things you'll want to do when in LA. Waking up to breakfast on the balcony and chilling on the couch watching Netflix were pleasant little surprises that you just don't get in a hotel. Cannot recommend it more",location
"The house is beautiful and immaculate, yet cozy. The bedroom was spacious and I spent a lot of time hanging out on the private roof deck. It was conveniently located and the permit, which allowed me to park on the street all day and night, was easily worth the price of the room. ",location
"I stayed in the Private Bed/Bath on the top level of Dennis' place.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  I had the privacy, the comfort,  and convenient proximity to all the places I had to go to.  I loved how the room and bathroom was decorated. There was shelving in the bathroom for all of my makeup, hair brushes, blow dryer, curling irons that just kept things organized and accessible.  There's a Samsung Smart TV in the room so I was able to watch youtube, or login to my Hulu/Netflix .  The window A/C unit keep the temperature of the room nice and cool.  Super important for me at the time because it had been really hot outside.  Dennis was very quick to respond and answer any questions. He also checked on my in the middle of my stay.  There was someone else renting his master, but I never saw them or ran into them.  Being at the top, I didn't hear the movement so it felt like I was alone. The washer/ dryer is right outside of the door and there was a big sliding mirror doors which were perfect to check out my wardrobe choices.  I wish I could of stayed longer. Parking in the neighborhood at night wasn't bad.  The furthest I walked to park was half a block.  Definitely, next time I'm in town, I'm hitting up Dennis' place if its available.<br/>",location
"This place was great. It was quiet, very clean, and so private. I would recommend this listing to anyone. The communication and attentiveness that you receive from Dennis was also something that I would say is a huge selling put for his townhouse. I had a great experience here. I highly recommend this place.",clean
"Me and my friend had such a great stay here, felt very welcome! Didn't get to meet Dennis unfortunately but we were always in contact and was looked after by his lovely friend. perfect location, close to everything and was beautifully decorated and furnished.

"This is a great little place to stay, you can walk to just about anything you need. Dennis is a great host and communicates with you on a regular basis to ensure everything is going well. <br/><br/>The bed was extremely cozy and comfortable and I loved sitting out on the balcony drinking a cup of coffee every morning. This was a great experience and recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great place to stay for an amazing price.",location
"Dennis has worked so hard to make his home beautiful and comfortable. I spent 3 weeks in one of the bedrooms and I couldnât have asked for a more ideal space for my stay. I had so much privacy with my own bathroom and outdoor balcony which I was able to work from during the days. One of my favourite things was I was able to use the kitchen to cook so I was able to make healthy food choices and save money and time. <br/>There is so much around just within walking distance, I didnât have a car so I was walking everywhere or getting a (very cheap) uber to further locations. It really is one of the best neighbourhoods in the city. Dennis and the other host Naia were so friendly and kind to me helping me adjust to LA life and giving me ideas on where to eat and hangout and just being friendly faces to have a laugh and a chat with. If I could, I would live with them permanently!",location
Awesome place! Loved my time.,location
Loved the space and the rooftop balcony. Everything was great!!!,location
"Dennisâs place was nicely decorated and is actually like the photos show. The bedroom opens to a rooftop patio which would be nice place to hang out on warm day. During my stay it was mostly to chilly to make use of it.<br/><br/>The neighborhood is in a great location. Plenty of restaurants, grocery stores (Whole Foods-2 blocks away), bars and dispensaries (if you need that that kind of assistance). Most places are a short walk or a cheap Lyft or Uber ride away.<br/><br/>Dennis has fluffy towels and nice sheets. Along with his warm and friendly hospitality, his place provides a enjoyable stay.",location
"I would highly recommend Dennis's place to other visitors. Dennis's home reflects his laid-back, stylish and picture perfect personality. I felt at-home, safe and welcomed. The master suite felt like a 5 star hotel with the large bathroom and seating area to read and sip your coffee. I look forward to rebooking in the near future!",location
Dennis was great to communicate with and very helpful and accomodating. I really enjoyed staying at his place. The room and space is really private and comfortable and I would definitely recommend it.,location

There is everything you need in the apartment for short and long term stays and Dennis and Naia do everything to make you feel at home.

"Dennis's place is truly special. He goes above and beyond to make your stay comfortable and easy. I felt completely at home from the beginning, and especially loved relaxing on the rooftop deck and playing with the adorable house pup, Sharky. To top it off, the location is superb. I don't think I could have chosen a better location (central and walking distance to most everything) if I tried! Would (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) % recommend here to stay, it's THE BEST!",location
"This is a great place in a great location.  I was made to feel totally at home and, while I didn't see him much because I was traveling, Dennis was very lovely and Isabella is great.

"The room was spacious with plenty of storage space and a private bathroom within the bedroom. You get to park in the garage space, which was really nice considering how difficult it can be to find parking. Dennis and Emily were both wonderful. They are so down to earth and really try to make you feel welcome and comfortable. If you require privacy, they stay out of your way, but also love to engage if youâre willing. I really appreciated that Dennis gave me access to basically everything in the house. Iâd recommend this place to anyone staying in the area!",location

"Great little spot that is secluded yet walkable to all of my favorite places in Los Feliz.  Very cozy amenities, my only issue, which is slight, is inability to control climate without contacting hosts, which I imagine is rarely an issue in Southern California.  While there is a small fan and space heater, the only window that can be opened is in the bathroom.  Overall, I would stay here again. ",location

Great if you are in need of a place to stay while in LA. Near everything and the location allows you to get a feel for the areas.,location
Great value for a nice clean studio apartment and Radu was very responsive if I needed anything.  Would definitely recommend this place to others!  ,clean
"What a wonderful little pad.  It's up a hill & not close to any buses for at least 2 miles, so a car/Uber is a must really, but it was quiet (which is one of the reasons I chose it), cozy, had some little extras provided (tea coffee, sugar, water) & all you need for a basic stay.  <br/><br/>If you have a car, you can park right outside on a private yard. There's a little kitchenette with a fridge, freezer box, plug-in stove to cook with, plus a microwave & a coffee maker that can heat water for tea.  There is also a washer & dryer in the shed next to the guesthouse that you can use. <br/><br/>Bathroom spacious, bed lovely & comfortable & I only spoke to Radu once, but he was perfectly happy to give me any info on the area & places to visit & if I needed anything to let him know.  <br/><br/>Would certainly go back though & recommend him to anyone!  Thanks, Radu!",clean
"Radio was a very friendly host and deserves his super host status. Concerning the location of the property, it is in a very convenient location easy to get to things especially in Hollywood and Beverly Hills. Talking about the space itself, I can't believe other people raved about this property as much as they did. I expected more of a care free space that I could return to after spending most of the day away from the property. It was quite the opposite. I would recommend Radu as a host, but I would not ever go to this property again. The reasons for this are as follows....first, when we arrived, the gravel dirt drive was damp and the welcome mat was not taking all mess from our shoe soles. There was nothing inside that we could use by the door to keep from tracking mud and dirt inside the space. This was one of the first things that happened which was making me to have to watch over the property more than I wanted to. Second, I learned that wiring sucks in the space where things like the coffee maker and heater couldn't be on at the same time. This lead me to being concerned when I watched TV, used the microwave, or blow dry my hair. I go to hotels and don't have to worry about blowing a circuit not at this property. Third, it concerned me that if I did blow a circuit, would Radu be able to fix quickly before we needed to use electricity. Our stay was during Christmas and I didn't know if he was staying at the house above or home for a period of time to spend with family. I certainly didn't want to be trying to find out myself where in the hell the circuit breaker was. Fourth, the bed was fairly comfortable, but it was so worn that if you say on the edge of the bed to even just get into it, I would slide off of it. I have never been on a bed that did that. Fifth, and what was probably the most critical problem was that the property is in a canyon and cell phone service is HORRIBLE. And both of us has service either through AT&T or Verizon. And the problem was compounded when we were having a family emergency and we couldn't get a sustained cell signal. How can all the reviews for this property not mention this, even if previous patrons just stayed one night?!?! Sixth, there were ants inside by the leak near the shower that was open to the outside. Not just one or two, but at least forty. Apparently this had happened two weeks ago but still wasn't remediated properly. Once I notified Radu, I was provided with a rusty ancient can of Raid to kill the ants. Previous remediation may have never been attempted. Seventh, the shower was nice and roomy, but by the shower door it leaked way too...",location
Very comfortable studio that's quick and easy to get to. There's plenty here to make you feel right at home. Our host made himself very accessible so communication was great - he was very hospitable. ,location
Hollywood Hills Guest House was an excellent choice for my stay in Los Angeles. Radu was more than accommodating and I enjoyed my stay at his property. I would definitely stay there again. ,location
"This was our first airbnb stay in the USA and I was a little hesitant to book but we had a pretty good experience. The room was fairly small for our 6 night stay (we also had a 4 large bags which we had to shuffle around a little) but it was a nice change from a motel and let's face it when you are on holidays you don't want to spend the whole time in your room. There was a lounge to sit on which was a good size. We spent most of our days out and about and watched a few movies at night. There is no TV signal but there is Amazon/Netflix available, must say the signal was pretty terrible but later at night (8pm onwards) it was better. The entry to the driveway is fairly tight and on a bit of a hill but we had a very large car and it was manageable. It was great to be able to use the washing machine and dryer whilst we relaxed in our room as opposed to sitting in a laundromat. I felt safe in this location, Hollywood can be pretty seedy. It was a short walk to Sunset Blvd and Hollywood Blvd and there were plenty of UBER drivers in the area to take us back when we didn't feel like driving and it was really cheap (under $10). I would recommend having your own car if you stay here though. The bathroom was large and there was room to fit some of our bags. There was a little heater in the room which really warmed the space up, just had to turn it off if we were going to run other appliances that used a lot of power eg hairdryer. This wasn't really a problem though. The powerboard that TV and heater plugged into was hanging in the air so I think this could have been tidied up a little. We didn't meet Radu but he was responsive when we sent messages. Check in/out was easy and wasn't as strict as what motels can be. Everything said I would stay there again, I guess it just depends to the traveller what they are after and how picky they are. ",clean
The host was not available but kept the key at the right place and I had no problems getting in. <br/>The place is pretty nice - quite small but enough for one person. It's designed not to stay in but more a place to sleep and stay out most of the time.<br/><br/>Overall the experience was pretty good and everything in the ad was accurate.,clean
Radu's place was awesome. It was very convenient to be able to be so close to Hollywood and the SFV.  Being so close to the canyon country store was great as well.  Radu was easy to book with and his place is just as described and pictured. Very clean and tidy. Highly recommend staying in the guest house.  ,clean
"Staying at Radu's Hollywood Hills Guest House with my girlfriend was a very comfortable and great experience.  Not only because the space was cozy and filled with all the necessary amenities and more, but because our host was exceedingly both polite and helpful too.  Halfway into our stay, Radu even asked if we needed more soap, shampoo, towels, plates, etc. (Which in my airbnb experiences so far, is quite rare).  <br/>The location is quiet and a bit secluded, though not at all far from any of the LA hotspots if you have a car.  It is stocked with a fridge, microwave, kitchenette, plates, bowls, glasses, mugs, strong water pressure, soaps, towels, good WI-FI and a 32"" LED screen with both Blue-ray and Netflix.  <br/>All in all, Radu was an excellent host and I would be more than glad to stay at his guest house again in the future.

The guest house is very cozy, there's plenty of space to park on the property, and you're a short drive away from West Hollywood.<br/><br/>Radu is very accommodating, but at the same time you'll feel like you've got your own private retreat. There's something in the air here - whatever it is, you fall asleep right away.<br/><br/>We'll definitely stay here again!",location
"Couldn't have been better. Listing was just as described, pictures perfectly accurate. Great communication from Radu. An affordable small, perfectly formed, clean place in a great location. Lovely!",location
Nice place! Great location!,location
Great place! Spacious and clean. Host was very welcoming and stayed in communication throughout the entire stay when needed. Highly recommended. ,clean
This was place was great! It was just as pictured/described. It perfect for myself and 2 daughters. It was close to shopping and many attractions. Garage parking was a bonus for me! The hosts were great and friendly. Check-in was simple. I would definitely recommend Nitzaira's place to anyone staying in the LA area! You won't be disappointed!,location
"Peter's home is wonderful: perfectly located, welcoming... The cats are friendly and it's easy to take care about them.<br/>I wish we had stayed longer and warmly recommend this place foir a few days in Venice !<br/>Plus Peter and Jenny will give you good advice on where to go :)",location
Absolutely recommended! Nice accommodation and very cozy backyard - really enjoyed my stay.,location

"Great location, check in smooth and at our convenience. The pool area is lovely and perfect for chilling out at the end of a long day. Wholeheartedly recommend. ",location
"We had an amazing stay at this apartment. It's located right between the beach, the Venice canals and Abbot Kinney. It has a kayak, surfboard and two bicycles to use. We didn't even use our car while we were there (parking was difficult when we first arrived Friday afternoon, but didn't seem quite as bad at other times ). The cats are wonderful and very easy-going: they cuddled with our kids, didn't wake us up to ask for food and were fine staying outside the bedroom when we closed the door at night. When we ran into a small problem it was solved within a few minutes. Peter left very detailed instructions for everything. Highly recommended!",location
"Elizabeth's place is beautiful, comfortable and centrally located in a beautiful neighborhood. Elizabeth is a great responsive host. The back yard is a gorgeous haven for relaxation. The room is not large, the bed takes up almost the entire space of the room, there is no desk and chair, so if you need to work you have to sit on the bed with your work. We truly enjoyed our stay and will return surely. ",location
"Highly recommended!  Check-in was super easy, and the flat is clean and cozy, with nice touches like bottled water, snacks, coffee and tea. The grounds with beautiful pool and spa are so relaxing, and the location can't be beat. There are lots of places within easy walking distance, and the hosts provide a manual with their recommendations for places to eat and drink, which we really appreciated.  The great thing about an Air BnB stay is the chance to live like a local. We loved  exploring this very cool neighborhood and wouldn't hesitate to book another stay. ",location
"Room had everything you'd need, including snacks and toiletries and great wifi. I didn't use the pool but spent some time relaxing in the garden behind the guest units. Quite a little oasis in Los Feliz!",clean

"Elizabeth & William's place is exactly as described and conveniently located. The room is perfect for a couple, with sufficient cupboard space. <br/>The swimming pool and jacuzzi are great to get some rest after a day of sightseeing.<br/>We didn't have any trouble finding street parking near the flat.<br/>The communication with Elizabeth was fantastic. She always replied within minutes and made sure we were ok during our stay.<br/>Thanks for everything! We'll definitely stay here again if we come back to LA.",clean
"This perfect respite in LA. Easily walkable to lots of choices of great restaurants, coffee shops, shopping, and to catch a concert at the Greek Theatre. The outdoor living space is lovely...warm, welcoming, private. Loved our stay. ",location
Such a beautiful oasis in a nice quiet neighborhood.  The bed and bedding were very comfortable.  The pool was super relaxing and hot tub was pristine.  Beautiful courtyard and property.  Everything was as described in the listing.  Snacks and refreshments were a nice treat.  Will definitely return. ,location

"Elizabeth and Will's place is awesome. I stayed for one night on a work trip and it was quiet, convenient to everything on the east side of LA, and the pool, hot tub, and relaxing areas were awesome. They were very communicative. Great place!!",location
Elizabeth's place was hands down the best Airbnb's I've stayed at. Her backyard is extraordinary- great for chilling in the pool after a long day at work. Really comfy bed and lots of thoughtful touches. ,location
Great place to stay! However I would recommend for couples only ,location
This is one of the nicest Airbnb homes we've ever stayed in. The pool and hot tub were perfect during an LA heat wave. Elizabeth was responsive to all of our needs. She's a fabulous host!  Can't wait to return!,host
" We stayed in The Flat. It was perfect.  It was very clean,  with a king bed. There is a Keurig and a mini fridge.  Everything you could need is provided,  like a hair dryer,  fan, bottle opener,  bottled water,  etc.  The yard is very private.  We never saw anyone else.  The pool and hot tub are fantastic.  The location is great. It feels very quiet and secluded,  but is close to lots of restaurants,  Hollywood and Griffith Park. Elizabeth is super fast at responding. We have already talked about staying here again. Loved it!",clean
The place was great! The pool and hot tub were really nice. It was walking distance from a lot of places to eat and shop which made the trip even better. Our host was very helpful as well. ,location

Elizabeth was very fast with all correspondence and the place is awesome!,clean
Great place and location!,location
Our stay was really special. The property is so well kept;esp the pool and backyard landscaping. Elizabeth so responsive and attentive even though we didn't get in until much later than planned. Still were able to decompress from our 7 hour drive in the fab jacuzzi even though late arrival for a Mon night. Wish we could've stayed longer and definitely would stay here again. A great little gem in LA. ,location

"Lovely place, close to Children's Hospital of LA in a cute neighborhood, close to many restaurants and cafes. The flat was well stocked including hair dryer and coffee maker. Host was very communicative and the pool was lovely.",location
"The place is very nice - private entry and you have your own space out in the back. Backyard was awesome! Great area to hang out and relax. <br/><br/>Only complaint was that we didn't know that another group would be staying right next to us and had to share the space in the backyard. <br/><br/>Other than that, great space to hang out. ",location
"A great location and accommodation!  My friend and I had stayed at another Airbnb in West Hollywood that was not nearly as nice. I had thought I had booked my previous Airbnb properly, but had neglected to get a spot for my final night in LA. It was such a serendipitous surprise that we were able to book at Elizabeth's place.  My friend and I were blown away by the beautiful and peaceful grounds (I took a dip in the pool; Delightful!) as well as the giant bed. There was a coffee maker and TV with cable, which was a plus for us.  We were so grateful to have found such a nice spot, and in a quiet, yet hip, neighborhood! We hope to book here, again, for a stay!!",location
Elisabeths home was very lovely and cozy it was super central and walking distance to great bars and restaurants. We would recommend this home to anyone who is searching for a cozy home away from home. ,location
"Clean place, nice area and the pool was beautiful. One issue was the parking, I woke up to a $73 ticket. I guess it was my fault cause I didn't read the signs.",clean
There is a lot of great outdoor space by the pool to get lost in a book and lay out .. a close drive to many great restaurants also a really easy place to find parking,location
Comfortable room with access to an incredible outdoor area.  Parking was easy and the location is very close to popular spots in Los Feliz.  Elizabeth was a very good communicator and even sent a reminder about avoiding street sweeping tickets.,location
Elizabeth was a great host.  We loved the place.  We will definitely stay here again.,location
This was our second time at Radu's place. The location is great and Radu is a welcoming host.,location
Nice and cozy little place so close to the beach! Peter and jenny were great hosts and had tons of tips on what to do around there. Friendly cats that greeted you every time you moved. Recommend staying here!,location
Hosts are very welcoming and great location!,location
"This is the perfect location to explore Venice and get a real, local feel for the area. They have bikes for use, wven a kayak to explore the nearby Canals! These two are a very laid back and nice couple. Enjoyed every minute here. ",location
"It's the little things that keep me coming back for more. The fancy shampoo and the extra toothpaste and the free Netflix and k-cups. Radu had all this to offer, and more, and frankly it all made for a wonderfully pleasant stay. ",clean
"Radu's place was great. We enjoyed our stay in the quietness of the Hollywood Hills, while being very close to all the places we like in L.A.<br/>The studio is very comfy and you can have a nice apÃ©ritif outside in the evening.",location
"Everything was perfect!<br/>The location was perfect. Really REALLY close to everywhere you need to go in LA, still super remote and quiet.<br/>The place was tidy and clean, the communication with Radu was super easy. 100% will recommend this place to all my friends! 10/10",clean
Great place in Hollywood Hills and I will definitely stay with Radu again when visiting LA. The location is nice and quiet yet close enough to plenty to do and great night life (not a walkable distance but an easy $5 Uber ride.) I highly recommend Radu's place.,location
"This was a cozy, comfortable spot with everything you need! Radu was accommodating  of flexible check-in and check-out times, which made our stay stress-free. The neighborhood is quiet and private, but a short drive from lots of attractions, including Universal Studios. The mattress is quite soft, so if that's not your thing, you might be uncomfortable. Overall a great experience!",location
"This was an absolutely wonderful place to spend two weeks. The photos were very accurate, and the space was very clean and well decorated. Parking was spacious, even though I was driving a large Chevrolet Suburban. The bed was comfortable and the shower was great. I had a busy schedule, having to visit studios in the Valley as well as in Hollywood. The location made this an easy task, as it was located just off of Laurel Canyon and I was able to get to all seven major studios in under an hour. Laurel Canyon County Store was a short walk away, and was a fun place to grab snacks/wine when I didn't feel like driving back down the hill. My only issues with the location were the complete lack of cell phone reception (to be expected in this area), and the occasionally spotty wi-fi. That said, I highly recommend this place for anyone visiting the area. This was my first experience with AirBnb and it couldn't have gone better. Thanks!",location
"Radu was a great host! His studio space is exactly as listed. As we are up in the hills, I forgot to read the check in instructions prior to arriving at the house and had to drive back down to do so. However, once you're inside it's easy to connect to the wifi. My husband and I were really there just to sleep and shower as we were out during most of the day. The free parking spot is more than enough and can fit at least two cars. <br/><br/>We would definitely stay here again in the future. We'd be happy to recommend Radu's place to our friends and anybody reading this review! ",clean
"I want to say that my trip to Los Angeles was fantastic and the stay with my host Radu was one of the best experiences I have had in 40 years of traveling. The location is excellent, only a short drive to the Sunset Strip and several great beaches. The room is perfect, cozy and well appointed. Radu is always available yet I felt like it was my own little place in the hills above Hollywood. When I come back again my plan is to stay here. This place is very special to me. ",location
"Radu's guest house was an excellent value in a desirable area, and at all points during my stay, Radu was responsive and accommodating. I really enjoyed staying in this area (a first), because it was so accessible to other areas in LA, but I felt a relaxation being up in the hills that wouldn't have been possible being a few minutes down the road in the thick of things. The guest house itself was clean with a good amount of space for one person, (although as an SF resident, my concept of space is probably different than a non-city dweller).",clean
Radu's place is small but perfectly formed!  It was very comfortable for a couple. All the details have been well thought out and beautifully designed - no cheap corners cut. There's also ample parking which is a blessing in that area.  Radu is a very responsive host. We couldn't have asked for a better place at that rate. I'd be very happy to go back again.,location
"I just can say it is not bad. The room is clean and quiet. And the car is necessary ï¼the room is too hot for now,even there is a small air conditioning.",clean
"Loved my stay here at Radu's place! <br/><br/>When we arrived, Radu greeted us and showed us around the place we were going to stay at. I greatly appreciated that! <br/><br/>First of all, there was so much space for parking which was awesome! The place was very cosy and was perfect for two people.  It was also very clean and organized! The place was equipped with towels, shower supplies, kitchen utensils, coffee machine, and little snacks. There was a cupboard with hangers so that you could hang your clothes. Also, there was a microwave, which came in handy! <br/><br/>There were two minor issues. First issue was that wifi was a little slow and spotty but it didn't really bother us. Second issue is that there is no phone reception if you have AT&T or Verizon. However, there is phone reception if you have T-Mobile or Sprint. This was explained by Radu. <br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed my stay here. Would definitely stay here again! <br/>",clean
"Radu was a great host, welcoming us in this beautiful place in the Hollywood Hills and being very responsive to our requests. The studio was small but comfortable and clean and located in a very good spot, close to the Hollywood Boulevard yet in a quiet neighbourhood. A perfect getaway in Los Angeles.",location
"When we arrived Radu  welcomed us and showed us around the place he was very nice, the area was beautiful and the space was great, it had everything we needed. Only complaint is one night we had a run in with 5 raccoons! but that comes with staying in the canyons! haha wasn't really a problem just scared us! ",location
"We chose this place because of the proximity to my family which lives nearby (on the same block!) and because of the pool. We were expecting very warm weather and my sister has a new baby so we wanted to spend time in the pool with them. <br/><br/>The location was also great because it is minimum one block to hipster coffee, bars and restaurants. It was so nice to be able to walk everywhere. We didn't have a car, but it looked like there was always parking available.<br/><br/>The flat was a perfect sized space for my boyfriend and I. There was a small TV, but we really didn't watch it (it has DirecTV hooked up). The bathroom had nice counter space, lots of towels and didn't feel cramped at all. This unit was all the space we needed for the two of us.<br/><br/>Elizabeth's communications were timely and easy to understand. We didn't have any issues with checking in or out. There was someone else in the other rental, but we never saw them. We hope to stay there again!",location
"We loves Elizabeth's place. It was a beautiful stay. The only unfortunate thing about the stay was that we wish we could have stayed longer. Her flat was so relaxing, we almost didn't leave the spot. The bed was the best bed we have been in. The spa shower head and the jet bath was an added bonus. Umm.. they also have a pool and a Jacuzzi.  Elizabeth also offers yoga on location, what?!? Amazing, right? Best AirBnB experience!",location
"Elizabeth's pool area is magical and we really enjoyed relaxing in the hot tub as well.  The property is unique and location was perfect.  We had challenges operating the jacuzzi tub, but Elizabeth responded promptly to our questions.  Also, if you run hot while sleeping, you might have a hard time with the fact that you can't control your AC.  A small fan is provided and that was helpful.  The Keurig with plenty of pods was much appreciated!",location
We had a blast in the pool! Would definitely return!,location
Elizabeth's response to a couple of issues could not have been faster!! She was right on top of things that needed attention. We enjoyed our stay very much.,clean

This is my second visit since April and perfect for me regarding location and lovely outdoor space with the little pool,location
Very convenient location to visit LA and easy to park nearby.<br/>The room is perfect for a couple. The terrace and the pool area are ideal to relax and enjoy the sun. I will stay there again during my next trip in LA :),location

"So lovely! A quiet oasis in the middle of everything. The bathroom, bed, pool, and courtyard were such a nice escape from all the chaos of our adventures. Accurate description and super EASY check in and out. Also, great communication from Elizabeth was great, she saved us from a parking ticket!",location
"Nice little place to stay each night and got to enjoy the relaxing backyard in the morning, it was a very enjoyable stay.",location
It's a great game place to stay in what is arguably LA's most happening neighborhood. Highly recommend especially considering you can't get anything close to a decent hotel in the area.,location
"Beautiful, out of this world property. Stay here!!!",location
Our stay with was absolutely fantastic! Perfect amount of space for three people and literally steps venice beach! They were very friendly and welcoming which helped us enjoyed our stay much more comfortably. The only issue is parking. Don't expect to find easy or close parking as you are right next to the beach in California. That wouldn't affect my decision to stay here again though!,location
"Fantastic stay, fantastic host. This was my first airbnb experience, was a little nervous about it but I had read good reviews on this place so booked and I was not dissapointed. Radu was very helpful with the checkin and checkout process. Very informative about LA. The room was very honely with nice little homely touches like the coffee machine, kitchenette etc. Definitely would stay here again. Thanks",clean
A very cool place to stay. Quiet and cozy with everything you need and less than five minutes from the strip. Radu was a very good host. ,location
Radu was an excellent host. Very easy to communicate with and very helpful. His space was comfortable and clean with all amenities as described. Radu showed us around the place when we arrived and made sure we had all the information we needed for the house as well as getting around the area. Wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. ,clean

Very good and comfortable place. The host is very nice and willing to help. ,clean
We had a good time at Radu's studio. It is a nice neighbourhood and with a car you are near to many sights around. He answered all of our questions around our trip to LA and was very nice. We recommend him and his studio to everyone who wants to travel to this city. ,location
"We had a good time at Radu's.  The location was great (short drive to Hollywood/Walk of Fame). The place was neat, the shower very nice and the bed comfortable. <br/>Thank you for having us. ",location
"Radu's place was clean and conveniently located. Interaction with host was good and check in was easy. We didn't enjoy the room. It is as pictured, what isn't shown though are the exposed pipes, paint and paint brushes under the sink, poorly done skirting and cover plate missing the the shower. <br/>The bed was uncomfortable. A fabulous coffee maker was provided but only came with white powder creamer. <br/><br/>The magazines on the table were from 2010-2012, I would have loved to have relaxed and read an up to date magazine. There are some inexpensive ways to improve this place. I guess what I could say was there was no attention to detail and it felt like a bachelor pad or backpackers. ",clean
"It was awesome! Great location, very clean and had everything I needed. Radu was a wonderful host and was very responsive to all my inquires. Would definitely stay here again!",clean
"We really enjoyed our stay in the guesthouse. It  was clean and the most important things were provided. It is pretty small but totally fine for two people. The location is great, only 5 min to Sunset and Hollywood Boulevard.  Communication with Radu was very easy and nice and while the guesthouse is attached to the main house, it is completely private.",clean
"This was my 1st time using Airbnb.  I've always been intrigued by the beauty and history of the rustic Laurel Canyon so that's why I selected Radu's place for my 1st Airbnb booking.  Radu's studio apartment is a peaceful retreat from the hustle and bustle of the nearby city.  The apartment is situated below the main living quarters of the home with its own dedicated entrance.  It's clean, the living area is small but efficient.  The bed is comfortable.  The spacious bathroom appears to have been newly remodeled.  The shower has good water pressure.  The apartment is tastefully decorated with vintage movie posters and other Hollywood memorabilia.  Being able to park on the property was a bonus.  Radu was accomodating - he periodically checked in via text/email to make sure things were going well.  Radu provided suggestions on things to do during an unexpected late-September heatwave.  I would definitely stay at Radu's place in the future. ",location
"Radus studio is really cozy and nice and the neighbourhood is save and quiet. There is also an nice cafe/supermarket down the road, where you can get tasty breakfast and the people there are really kind!<br/>Visiting the city was also not such a problem. We had a rental car, but were also using uber-taxies from time to time (stressfree and not expensive).<br/>Radu was on travel during our stay in his studio. But he sent us all necessary information by mail in advance and we always stayed in contact. He is really friendly and we really loved staying in this studio during our stay in LA. ",location
"the location was perfect. I was close to everything in hollywood, and just a few miles away from universal studios! the room was clean and there were a good selection of movies, blu rays and dad's. I would recommend this place to everyone who wants to go to Universal Studios.",clean
"Radu was very kind and on top of communication: he answered our inquiries quickly and provided us with suggestions for small things such as where to print out boarding passes. He provided the basic amenities that a hotel would provide, and gave us a quick tour to show us where everything was at the beginning of our stay. The stay was lovely, and we felt comfortable and secure. We were there for three nights and four days, and we were able to nap during the day and even watch a couple of movies at night. We went to California for a quick trip to relax, so while we did spend most of the time being tourists, we were also able to recharge and enjoy the place.",clean
Great Location near Sunset Strip for many activities. Close to Hollywood Bowl. Place was clean with good amenities. ,location
"Radu's studio is exactly as described. It's an awesome location, literally 5 minutes from sunset Strip but in the quiet, quirky and bohemian Laurel Canyon. The off street parking is very important and useful. The studio is efficient and simple and has everything you need with a great shower and comfortable bed and sofa as well as 2 seats to enjoy sitting outside in the canyon. ",location
Great stay at Radu's place! Location was perfect for our trip. Only a 5 minute ride to Hollywood Boulevard and a 10 minute ride to Universal Studios. The place was clean and comfortable. The room was nicely decorated with classic Hollywood movie posters. Would stay here again if back in LA. ,clean

"Clean, comfortable, peaceful, and affordable private studio near the Laurel Canyon Country Store. Close to many major city thoroughfares, landmarks, and scenic points. Communication with Radu was easy. Would stay again!",location
"Lovely little casita in the canyon, 5 mins drive to Sunset. Cute and comfortable with a responsive host. Guest watch out: very limited mobile coverage, so make sure you map it and download instructions prior to arrival. ",location
Radu replied quickly to whatever inquiries we had. The place was smaller than expected but it was as pictured. Full amenities were provided and the bed was comfortable. We enjoyed our 2-night stay.,clean
Radu was a great host! And the location is beautiful. ,location
"Great experience. I don't know if it was because we stayed at Christmas time, but we felt as if Radu was our Santa, since when we asked for something he just brought it to us and we didn't even see him once ;)",clean
"My sister and I stayed here for 4 nights and can't say enough about the location! It was perfect for down town LA and had ample parking too. <br/>Radu was a great host who communicated really well with us both before and after our stay, giving super helpful directions to find his place. <br/>Thank you for making our first trip to LA so successful :) ",location
Wonderful place to stay for 2. Radu keeps the place very clean and jus about everything you need. A little warning that's out of his control is parking and the road leading up to his place is pretty steep as well as tight roads if driving anything bigger than a full size car. ,clean
"As usual, Radu's hospitality exceeds expectations. <br/>The place is as clean and new as I remember from my first stay over 18 months ago. <br/>I won't hesitate to recommend Radu's place and will be back. <br/>Don't forget to walk up the street and experience the view!",location
Radu's place was exactly as described. He was an excellent communicator and was incredibly flexible with check-in/out times which helped a lot coming in off a long haul flight. I was in town solo for business and by car it was easily accessible to everything. It was a very pleasant & comfortable stay! ,location
"Wish I could give 3 and 1/2 stars.  It was only a bit worse than I expected for the price but a 4 star rating would not reflect that opinion.  The wifi was not strong, so it is not possible to use facetime, wifi call etc unless you are outside of the unit closer to the parking spot, which was a large inconvenience.  Overall, the area is quiet and very nice, but I heard pretty loud adult, bedroom sounds (you know what I mean) from the unit above the first night I was there, when it was very clear my unit was occupied so there shouldn't have been confusion about that. I'm not going to embarrass anybody by pointing out who lives there.<br/><br/>I will say this- the parking spot is mighty clutch although a bit narrow through the fence. Radu responded to my emails pretty much immediately, seems like a nice guy.  I'm not saying you def shouldn't stay here, I'm just saying I was expecting a slightly better situation, and not the noise from above, etc, but maybe my standards are all screwed up. <br/><br/>If you're willing to chance it based on those factors then go for it.  If not then I think you get the gist. ",location

Stunning view from an extremely convenient location. Everything about the accommodations were terrific and as advertised. We really enjoyed ourselves and would happily stay here again and again any time we are in Los Angeles.,location

"Amazing place to stay. Bed and pillows were crazy comfortable and what more do you need other then a bed, bathroom, coffee maker, and fridge with a pool and outdoor living space as nice as theirs??!! Very quiet and clean. A few blocks walk to restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping and grocery store. No rental car needed. Anything else you need is a quick uber ride away. Host was quick to respond to any questions and provided great suggestions for dinner. Will definitely stay again!!!",clean

The best place ever in LA ! Great host and perfect place :),location
Just as fabulous as pictured!!!!! Williamâs oasis is a quiet retreat hidden behind a gate on a very safe neighborhood street.  We were in the en suite room attached to the house. A separate cottage is across the patio that also includes a washer/dryer and microwave. Parking for the units is on the street but day or night we never had trouble finding a spot very near the home.<br/><br/>The king bed is very comfortable! Linens great towels and beach towels are provided. There is a fridge and coffee maker in this unit and a spa shower and jetted tub! We were delighted to open the fridge and find chilled bottles of water! <br/><br/>The most amazing amenity is the upper patio and pool/hot tub area. The landscaping is beautiful and the therapeutic waterfalls are lovely as at any European Spa we have visited!!!!<br/><br/>William leaves plenty of guest booklets about attractions in LA. Many restaurants are nearby. We had a fabulous breakfast at Millieâs just down Sunset. A car helps you access a wider perimeter but public transportation and Uber are easily accessible <br/><br/>We are already planning a return visit to Williams wonderful place and are sure youâd love it too!,location
The stay was amazing! The host were very friendly and made us feel right at home. I absolutely loved all the art work and old pictures that hung around the house. I just wish the weather would have permitted us to use the surf boards and kayak they so kindly provided as well.,clean
"The location was perfect! The canals were lovely and being just two blocks from the beach was very convenient. Our hosts were very understanding to our particular needs. Our adult sons took to their cats immediately and commented that they would definitely stay at Max's place, were they ever in the area again.<br/><br/>We were a bit concerned that the back door was left open all night for the cats to go in and out, as opposed to having a cat door. We tend to be more security minded. While shoes are asked to be removed while inside, the carpets are already quite dirty. This could be a landlord issue - not sure. The top blanket on the bed we slept in needed to be washed before we came, or just left off the bed.<br/><br/>We do hope that we did not encroach on the family too much as we definitely took over their cozy home. Also hope we didn't interrupt the shower schedule and make them late for work! All in all, it certainly met our needs, and our boys felt comfortable staying, which was the most important thing of all! Thank you!",location
"The location of this place is superb, and with the bikes exploring the boardwalk up until Santa Monica is a lot of fun and made easy. The bedroom is small but very cozy. Compared to other Airbnb experiences, we did not feel as warmly welcome but more like business only though.",location
The location of the place is incredible - you will not find a better deal for a place under five minute walk from the beach. The place is right next to the Venice canals which is just a really nice walk. All the amenities were at least as good as expected. Would definitely consider booking this place again when I am in LA.<br/>Max was very accommodating and easygoing. We watched a Cavs-Warriors finals game and had a great chat. Too bad we only stayed for one night.,location
Cute and comfy and two blocks from the beach!  Great stay!,location
We really enjoyed our stay at this picturesque spot in Venice. The hosts were great and provided everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Having use of the kayak and bikes to explore the canals and the sea front was a real bonus! Thanks for making the last night of our trip so pleasant... It's left me with a great final impression of LA!,location
"Peter and Jenny's place was the perfect spot for my get-away to Venice beach, which was literally a two minute walk away. As hosts, they were so personable and laid back. I felt very comfortable and welcomed during my stay with them. I also greatly enjoyed their two cats, which made the stay even cozier for animal lovers. I liked having a cute cuddle buddy during the night... Made it feel even more like home. They had bikes, a surf board and a kayak available which I regret not taking advantage of using. Perfect stay. I would highly recommend booking at their place. ",host
"My fb and I only used this place to sleep. It was very convenient. <br/>The only thing that I'll suggest is make sure that the sheets are clean. There was some sand on the bed when we got there and we were to shy to ask for clean sheets. <br/>Also not sure if this place offers breakfast since its b&b but we didn't hear anything from the host so we assumed they didn't provide you with breakfast. <br/>Other than that, it's a quiet place and super close to the beach. <br/>Oh! And parking during the day it's kind of hard but at night it's easy to find a spot! ",location
Perfect location! Only Five minutes walk to the beach and Venice Canal! Peter and Jenny were so nice. Enjoyed the stay!,location
It was lovely to stay here. We had the keys left for us to get in as we were late and the room was nice and cool with a big window. The location was very close to the beach which was awesome! Our hosts weren't around much but neither were we. Thank you for having us for the one night. It was great! Definitely recommend :) they have a very sweet kitty that kept us company too ;),location
"great place to stay. just a walk away from the beach. we borrowed their surfboarf and hit the waves for a day. we could also use kitchen, garden, bikes, kayak.<br/>its a shared space but even with us being a group of 4 people it worked out fine",location

"Great place to stay for a trip to L.A. The place is well-located and within easy driving distance of some of the best parts of the city. The area immediately around the airbnb has a lot of great restaurants and bars to pop into as well. The place itself is as amazing as you expect! We really enjoyed using the pool and the hot tub. All in all, a great experience and will try to stay again if ever in town!",location
Williamâs place was a great spot for our two nights in the L.A. area. The property is gorgeous and the accommodations had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Nothing better than getting work done in the sun by the pool. Parking was easy and plenty of food and drink options within nearby walking distance.,location
Lovely cottage with a beautiful patio and pool-a true oasis.,location

Great place in wonderful Los Feliz neighborhood. Walking distance to a bunch of restaurants. The hot tub is very nice and the bathroom is lovely and even fancy. There are nice touches such as beer/water in the mini fridge. Overall fantastic place to stay!,location
This place was amazing! So peaceful and tranquil and quiet and private. I had a very long hectic trip and needed a place to stay last minute. The backyard is so special. I was initially concerned about being attached to the house. But I felt total privacy.  The pool was the perfect temperature and clean. Same with the hot tub. It did get a little buggy out back so just have some bug spray on hand! When my ride out got delayed they were super accommodating and let may hang in the back yard even after they needed to clean the place until my ride arrived. I will definitely be coming back here. It was totally booked except for those 2 days I got. I wish I could have stayed for a week!,location
Jacuzzi was lovely and hosts were super responsive. Recommend it!,clean
It was great! thank you so much We had an awesome time at venice Beach! they did everything to make our trip perfekt even helped us with a ride to Disneyland! couldn't have wished for better Hosts!Hope to see you soon! definitely recommended :),host

"Very good location, very close to the beach.<br/>Surfboards available which is a plus!<br/>The only think is the parking. We thought there was a private free parking, but is necessary to look for it in the street and is not very easy.",location
The house is close to the beach and bike from Venice to Santa Monica with Max' s bikes is very nice.  The place is a good deal for a night stand. ,location

Stunning place with amazing backyard and Swiming pool in a super cool neighborhood. Everything in a great location! Coffe places right around the corner and lots of classic or hipsters places to eat.,location
"Radu's place is super secluded in the heart of beautiful Laurel Canyon. <br/><br/>Postcard views of LA from on high are a short walk from your front door and the bustle of Hollywood is a 5 minute drive / 30 minute walk.<br/><br/>Be warned, the return walk from Sunset is not for the faint hearted, but therein lies the  secret of the canyon - its seclusion.",location
"Randy's place is great, quiet and secluded! He was really easy to engage with and everything was clean and in order. His place is readily accessible by car and places are easy to get to...such a lovely stay in a sweet studio. ",location
"Honestly the coziest, cleanest, best little hideaway you could hope to find in the canyon. 5 stars all around. ",location
"Radu's place was good, exactly as described. The wi-fi was a bit weak, which was inconvenient since the house gets no cell phone service to begin with, but other than that there was nothing wrong. It was definitely worth the price.",price
"The apartment was exactly as described and perfect for our stay.  Everything was clean and worked well.  Having a private parking area was essential, as we needed to use our car to get to many of the places we wanted to visit around the city.  We cannot recommend Radu's apartment enough!",clean
"Great place to stay for a trip to Venice.  The room was nice and right on the canals.  The hosts were very nice, thank you!",location
Had a great stay with the hosts who were extremely welcoming and accommodating. Fantastic location for the beach and restaurants. It's really nice walking along the canals as well. I would highly recommend this bedroom for anyone looking for a fun and affordable stay in Venice!,location
"Fantastic hosts, couldn't be friendlier or more helpful throughout our stay! Great location exactly as described, two easy blocks from the beach and use of bikes & surfboard really made it a special beach weekend! Place is exactly as described, you won't be disappointed!",location
"The location was great as described, very close to the beach, but quiet and looked safe. The hosts were communicating clearly and were very helpful and friendly. The cats were absolutely adorable! We also could borrow bikes and surf board!<br/>The only thing - the bedsheets were very old, worn out and looked very dirty (I believe they were not, but didn't seem presentable). <br/>All in all, we enjoyed our stay and will recommend this place to friends",location
great location and great hosts I felt at home,location
"The room is very well located and easy to access. We appreciated to have a bottle of wine and fresh flowers to welcome us in our room. Everything is clean and we even had some extra towels for the beach.<br/>The room is quite small and the bathroom is really tiny, moreover the toilet inside is not very convenient especially for 4 people using it. The breakfast was nice as we can take anything from the fridge, but there is no table and no place to take it, so we stoud in the kitchen while our host was sitting on her couch next to us. So we sometimes felt unwanted, but maybe because we are very discret because the hosts are quite nice.",clean
Host was very friendly and cats were cute. Had a good stay- didn't spend much time there but enjoyed the time that we did.,location
"Radu's place was great. It was super close to all the sites we wanted to see and the parking was very convenient. I did have occasional trouble with weak wi-fi and a few bugs, but that's to be expected when you're up in the hills. I would definitely stay again.",location
"The place was PERFECT. Small, quant and out of the way in the Hollywood hills. So scenic. 10/10 will be staying here again next time I'm in LA. Radu was also the perfect host, readily available to help with anything I needed. ",location
"Radu is a very responsive and attentive host. The apartment was clean and comfortable (the bathroom and shower were great). Location is excellent - very close to West Hollywood, Sunset Blvd, Beverly Hills and Mulholland Drive. ",clean

"Great stay!<br/><br/>You park right in front of the door, even with a bigger car even though the entrance is narrow.<br/><br/>Good shower, good bed. Wifi could use a boost, but is good.<br/><br/>Close to all entertainment on hollywood and a short drive to the studios. But located in a quiet neighborhood in the mountain.<br/><br/>Would definitely stay here again!",location
"The place was in perfect condition. The only issue could be the location: in order to reach the house you definitely need a car, since there are no pedestrian paths.",clean
"Radu was a great host, he was very attentive in making sure we had everything we needed when we arrived and gve us same great spots to visit. The studio apartment is a great size open planned space with everything you need. There is a great little convenience store about 5 minutes walk down the road as well as a a great hiking trail for those interested in a morning walk. All in all, I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a small place near by west hollywood who doesnt want to be in the hustle and bustle of it all. Lovely quiet place in a beautiful surrounding! ",location
The location is fantastic! Especially if you're driving. The local store is walkable. This is like a hotel and you can not cook easily at the studio BUT it is so beautiful it shouldn't matter. Loved it! ,location
"Apartment was comfortable, quiet, and had easy parking. It is close to downtown and to Sunset Blvd, but feels very removed-- good for sleeping!",location
Nice apartment. Cool location. ,location
I feel so lucky to have come across this fantastic spot. It's a wonderful Hollywood Hills bungalow that feels both peaceful/secluded but also part of the exciting LA scene. The space was clean and with a lot of Hollywood character! I would definitely recommend staying here :),clean
Thanks Radu.,clean
Best location up in the beautiful hills! There is no cell service but wifi works great. It was exactly what we were looking for and way more affordable than most hotels.,location
"Lovely, quiet spot in the heart of Hollywood. Easy check in/out. Great place to leave your car and take Lyft. ",location
"Great spot in the hills! It was so nice to have a private parking spot, and getting around with Lyft was cheap & easy!",location
Great location and quiet spot above Hollywood and close to the Valley.,location
"Radu's place was clean and exactly what we were looking for! It was a cozy place in the hills, quiet but only a short drive to Sunset Boulevard. Having an off-street parking spot was a must for us, but navigating the hilly roads and the slightly narrow driveway opening might be a bit difficult if you're driving an SUV. We would stay again!",clean
The house was lovely. Up in the hills but still close to lots of restaurants and night life. Easy quick weekend trip! Radu was very responsive. ,location
The place was great and Radu was a great host but I did have some inconveniences. No A/C when we got there and fan was broken. Water line was broken during our trip which was a major inconvenience. This wasn't Radu'a fault and communication was good about it but still not the best experience over all.  ,location
"The description is accurate. The location is close to sunset and hollywood and place is very clean. The bed is really comfortable; however, there are many ants in the place, especially on the bed, which is annoying while sleeping. The parking is guaranteed which is nice. Driving into the parking is a little bit challenge because the entrance is narrow and there is a big hole on entrance ground which added additional difficulty to get in on the uphill road. ",clean
"We had a wonderful stay here, such a great neighborhood and space to spend time on vacation.",location
"This was our second time staying here, and it was just as great. Love the location, feels like you're out in the country, yet the clubs and restaurants are just a five minute drive away. Radu's place is cozy and comfortable and has everything you need.",location
Very easy to work with. No hastle or confusion. Quiet central spot.  Loved the canyon market!,location
"Perfect location for anyone who wants to see all of LA. It is 15-30mins between anything you could want to see, beaches, museums, Hollywood, and many more.",location
Great location and very clean. Minutes from Hollywood Boulevard.,clean
Radu's place was perfect for my wife and I. It really gave us a good sense of what it feels like to be a local in the Hollywood Hills. It's close to everything that matters. <br/>I was pleasantly surprised at how clean and cozy it was for the price. The pictures were not deceiving like some other places I know of. <br/>I hope I'm able to book this place again on my next visit and I recommend anyone that wants to close to everything to book it as well.,clean
"Radu is a great host. He was very responsive and worked with us when we wanted to check in a little early. The location and private parking is what really sold us, very close to everything that we wanted to do. We rented a Prius and had no problem parking. The description of the property is accurate. If you plan on spending the day out and only staying in to sleep and wash up (like we did), this place is perfect.",location
Great location and the wifi either perfectly which helped since my phone got no reception there.,location
"We really loved the location of this studio. It's in the middle of LA but at the same time away from all the city noise. This place is very tiny, but it has all the basics you might need for a short trip. In my opinion, it might use some upgrades and maybe pest control. You can't leave any type of food out on the kitchen counter or on the coffee table, ants will find it right away.",location
Excellent location and quite setting. Perfect for single or couple. Great private parking. Wifi signal was adequate. Will stay here again and highly recommend. Owner was around and available but never needed.,location
"Radu has been very nice and responsive throughout our stay. The place is good enough for a couple to stay. It was clean and very well maintained. Also, there was enough space for car parking.",clean
We enjoyed the location and the outside area. But the Appartement is smaller than it looks on the pics.,location
Easy to get to the east of west side of town from this great studio apartment!,location
"Everything as pictured. Great location, communication and response, easy check in.",clean
"Great stay at Radu's place. Good location, everything we needed for a few nights in Los Angeles.",location
"Radu's place is a nice, cute little place.  It's small, clean and pretty much has all you will need.  Shower is great.  Bathroom nice.  Coffee.  Fridge.   Etc.  Host was responsive and helpful.  No blowdryer (I don't use one so no biggie to me) so if that matter to you, bring one.  If you have a low profile car the dip at the head of the drive may freak you out but I managed just fine with my Prius.  If you have a car it is quite ideal with parking right in front of your place.  My cell service (Verizon) didn't work up in the canyon (you are in the mountains so it's not a surprise).  internet tv just kept dropping out and internet was slow in general.  But, like I said, it's the ""hills"" so it simply is what it is.  If you need to work from here, you may reconsider but for me, I work all day in LA and welcome no service at night.    I've already booked this place again in a few weeks.  It served my needs just fine, clean, comfy bed, quiet.  Coyotes yowling and owls hooting at night were an extra treat.   Laurel Canyon is magic.",clean
"This was our first time using Airbnb and everything from the checking in, to our stay and checking out was so smooth. Radu's room was quaint and quiet. Surrounded by trees in the Hollywood Hills. Room was cozy. Within 5 to 10 minutes of well known Hollywood Blvd attractions. Radu was prompt on his responses and when we requested a fan, it was there and running upon our return. A perfect stay for us. We'll definitely return someday!",location
Check in was easy. Close to where we needed to be. It was great.,location
"The benefits of this AirBNB were the location in Laurel Canyon and the free parking space included. Otherwise, our stay was just satisfactory. The unit looked a lot cleaner and brighter in pictures. It could have used a better cleaning prior to our arrival. The windows did not have screens, therefore opening them for some circulation allowed bugs to come inside. The wifi was also quite spotty. We appreciated the host dropping off extra towels when we asked. If you are okay with a basic accommodation, you will probably be satisfied with this place. ",clean
It is a clean place. The bed was very comfortable.  Fairly close to many places but you would need a car for better transportation. The room is very small and dark. The photos look better. I often visit LA. Usually stay in hotels. I think this place is overpriced. I expected a better place. ,clean
"A great place, in a fantastic neighbourhood close to everything! Would love to come back!",location
"If you want quiet, rustic, and private, I highly recommend this unit. We attended an event at the Dolby Center which was just 1.8 miles away and a very pleasant walk.<br/><br/>Leaving the chaos and clutter of Hollywood Boulevard and retreating to the canyon is a lovely experience.",location
The place was good for the price. It was a small studio that was centrally located. It had the basics. The mattress was really old and flat so it wasn't the best. There were some ants but the owner had some spray. The driveway was sort of hard to get up and it scrapped the underside of my car. Overall pretty decent. It's a good place to sleep when you have other attractions to go to.,clean
"This place has a definite charm to it, straight from the early 1970's.  The location is ideal for Hollywood sightseeing, and its proximity to Sunset Boulevard and the 101 mean the Valley and trendy neighborhoods like Los Feliz and Silverlake are in easy reach.  In spring and fall weather, you might not find a better value - in summer, it's a bit warm, caveat emptor - Radu and Laila are great hosts, and the view of the city at night from the top of their street is breathtaking.",location
"If you stay this hide, you must have a car because this house is located in the mountain. Itâs very quiet place and surrounded by nature. So youâll see some insects there. You have to bring your dryer they donât have it. ",location
Great and calm location ,location
"Radu is an excellent host. He communicated very well throughout the process, the space was as described and great location for all of Los Angeles.  ",location
"Raddu was a great host. His studio was much more spacious than it appeared in pictures. Check-in/out was a breeze. It was quiet at night, the a/c worked well, and the bathroom was well stocked. We spent very little time at the house (using exclusively for sleeping) and we were very satisfied.",clean
Radu provided a small but safe place for us to stay,location
I stay here every time I come to LA. Great location,location
We had a great stay here. Radu was always easily reachable and responded very fast. He was also very helpful.,location

Radu's location is great. Super easy to get to the rest of LA. Private and quiet location. Very clean room and easy check in. Excellent hospitality. Surpassed all expectations.,clean
"The place was definitely a cute spot mostly suitable for a single person, or a couple. Lots of great spots around the area. Clean, studio. Was able to come and go as we pleased, and it was nice that the studio is located on the side of the house so we can have our own privacy. Would most definitely stay here again.",location
Always a great stay at raduâs!,location
"Pretty good location for visiting Hollywood, Beverly Hills and Universal Studios.",location
This place is exact as described. Make sure you are okay with the location being remote and probably having no cell service (as mentioned in the description). The host is a nice gentleman and he is prompt to respond.,location
"Amazing location!! It is a quiet area right in the heart of the city. You will definitely need a car to move around. Better if not a sports car because pulling into the driveway is a little challenging. The place is cozy but has all what is advertised on the add. Nothing more, nothing less. Radu was very quick to reply to all my questions and needs. No complaints from my part.",location
Perfect location for all activities that want to be done while in Los Angeles. Clean apartment with good amenities. Great spot for a weekend get away!,location
"Cozy space, prob best for one person or young couple, quiet and beautiful neighborhood. Host is very quick to respond, place to park",location
Great place! Loved staying in the hills.,location
"Expect dishonesty. Misleading about the space and the PARKING. False promises of reimbursement to clean a car that was hung up and in potholes...Unless you want your car tore up, don't attempt to stay here. It is impossible. Had to park blocks away on a dark canyon hilly road each night to walk back up to this dark place. It's the equivalent of a small, basement room with people walking above at all hours. It's super old and by far not hollywood hills standards. I felt like a tent would've been more desirable. Also the bathroom shower has a window that says do not shut...was freezing...The heat is a portable little corded oil heater and a tiny tiny electric heater in bathroom. Worse than a college dorm. The bed is practically falling apart, ceiling fan did not work...the tv is useless b/c of no cable, and the lighting is by far the worst of any place I've ever stayed. You can hardly see to get ready in the bathroom...I can't believe the positive reviews on this place...and I've stayed in some truly terrible spots! The host is not at all truthful or respectful of his guests so this is my honest review!",location
"Radu is a particularly great communicator and was quick to respond/accommodate all of our asks. He completely gave us our space and privacy despite the studio being connected to his house right above. We felt safe and the location was great. Central yet quiet and restorative. We stayed during a very cold weekend in LA and found the space heater to take more time than we would have liked to warm up the space, but I think our experience was unusual and really a result of the rare cold front that passed through. Just a heads up if you tend to run cold! All in all, the studio is great find and Radu is an experienced and intuitive host. Highly recommend.",location
"Good little budget studio! Itâs a bit off the grid, so WiFi and cell service are very spotty, but we were close enough to the main roads to see everything we came to see. Cute little touches of old Hollywood throughout. Would recommend if youâre looking for an affordable way to experience the area.",location
"Susan's place is really wonderful if you are a person who is looking for a quiet and comfortable place while being not too far away from the central part of LA. I've been able enjoy little bit of cooking, reading, and retreating from Susan's place. She is attentive to ensure you're comfortable and her two dogs are very friendly and sweet. I highly recommend anyone to her place! ",location
She welcomed me and helped me whenever I had a problem.,clean
I had a lovely time at Susan's place. Her introduction to the room was warm and welcoming and then left me to my own devices which I actually prefer. She was extremely quick to reply to any questions I had and was a lovely person all around. Would definitely stay there again without hesitation. ,clean

"Susan's guest house is pretty and fully equipped. The backyard is huge. There is even an orange tree! During my stay, another guy moves into the main house(before him, nobody stays in the main house). It is weird in the beginning because we kinda live in the same area and share the backyard and we don't know each other. I did not expect this ""roommate"". But we talk later. Other than that, the guest house is great for a short/long stay!",host
"Had a great stay at Susan's place. The location was very homey, cozy, and cute. It was great getting to know the tenants of the main house. It was close to many stores and restaurants like the famous Portos (at a walkable distance). There's also a great walking and biking section near the house that goes for a mile or so, ideal for walking your dog or going for a jog or a ride on the bike.",location

"I lived in this space for a month, and it was everything I needed! Itâs perfect for one person, but I had a friend stay with me a couple of days, and itâs kind of tight for two. Nevertheless, everything was a breeze from check-in to check-out. The tenants in the main house are very kind! They would offer suggestions for food and polite chat whenever we would run into each other. Getting used to their three dogs took a minute, even for someone who grew up with dogs. They bark very loudly when they hear someone outside, but that was it- all bark. Still, I had to reassure friends when they came to visit to not be alarmed by the barking. All in all, it was a great space and a fantastic location! I was sad to go.",clean
Amazing stay. Definitely plan on staying here again. Thanks so much! Absolutely recommend! Renita and Anna are the best.,location

"I would describe this space as cozy, quaint, relatively small, artistic, and filled with character. <br/><br/>Max and his partner were quite helpful, polite, and friendly, in regards to sharing their knowledge of Venice, and were able to point me to where I needed to go. <br/><br/>The room was smaller than I thought it would be, but it was quite comfortable.<br/><br/>In terms of the apartment's proximity to Venice Beach and the boardwalk, you will be hard-pressed to find a better venue. Everything was walking distance and easy to get to. <br/><br/>I enjoyed my stay, and it was a great, first California experience for me. ",location
"Had a great stay, it's a great location in a lively neighborhood and their apartment is cozy and comfortable!",location
"Friendly couple, clean room, thank you! ",clean
"Overall, we had a great stay, the room was as described (clean, comfy bed, not big). Max and J******** (not using their real names here) were friendly and suggested nearby bike hire and kindly posted some postcards we had forgotten about. The two cats are also lovely and friendly. <br/><br/>We felt a bit weird about pretending to be friends of the host - I think they have issues with neighbours/landlord so as there was a plumber visiting we had to pretend to already know them when we arrived which threw us off a little. <br/><br/>There were also no bagels in the kitchen for breakfast - not a big deal, but maybe worth checking if a quick breakfast is important to you. <br/><br/>The shower pressure was really low which the hosts did mention to us, and the plumber's visit clearly indicates that this is a problem which will hopefully be fixed. <br/><br/>The hosts were great, and I don't want to criticise their attitude at all as they were really friendly, but the accommodation was just a little disappointing for us. However, it might be that none of this will bother you which is great! ",clean
"Amazing location, super friendly hosts and cats. Very very low water pressure, not really enough to wash your hair if it's long, very quiet and cool at night so we had great sleeps. Clean space, and our hosts were so helpful with recommendations. Pretty small, so better for a single traveller rather than 2.",location
"Good location, great hosts, awesome if you love cats",location
Really nice apartment. Prefect location!,location
The host canceled this reservation 22 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.,clean
Nice place! Located in the heart of Venice! Friendly people. We had a great stay! ,location
Loved it! Location was really good and felt at home,location
Everything was great. They were really helpful to make us comfortable and more enjoyable visit to LA. Many thanks!!,clean

"Great spot, terrific bed, super well equipped kitchen. Thankful for this great experience! ",location
"My daughter stayed in Susan's place for three months while doing her internship in LA. It was the perfect little place for her. Location was great, and in a safe neighborhood. Susan was a breeze to work with. She responded quickly to all communications and was very helpful. We highly recommend this space!",location
"Wonderful place and she has two amazing, calm, and friendly pups who will just casually say hi from time to time.",location
"Great communication, very helpful host!",clean
"Wonderful place to stay, even asked mid trip if i needed anything so really happy with this place. I hope it'll be free next time I'm in LA!",clean
"Great location, but the streets surrounding the house can get a bit testy. Also, the place is quite a bit smaller than I would have assumed from the photographs.",location
Perfect location for what we wanted on this trip! The space had everything we needed!,location
Radu's place was close to Hollywood boulevard and Beverly hills. It should be cleaner though.,location
Good stay great location,location
"Raduâs place was a great stay. I was there for 2 nights and found the bed comfortable, bathroom clean and well sized and the out door space pleasant for sitting in the sun. Great location in Laurel Canyon and a large are for off street parking. Would happily recommend and look forward to coming back some time when in LA in the future.",location
"Amazing location and Radu was very quick to respond to any questions. We were very happy with our stay and checking in/out was very easy and clear. The room is clean and comfortable, just what we were looking for. Thanks Radu!",clean
"Radu provided a safe, comfortable, cozy, quiet, and clean place for my husband and me to stay during our long weekend trip. We would definitely return! Just a heads-up, because of the location in the Hollywood Hills, if you have Verizon, thereâs no phone service, so you will depend on the WiFi or data. Sometimes this affects Lyft/Uber drivers so itâs helpful to know the general direction where youâre going.",location
"Great place. Itâs in the hills away from everything, a little convenient store at the bottom of the hill. Itâs about a 5 minute walk down, but serious trek up, not bad if you do it once. A car down to the Chinese Theatre is about $5-$6.",location
"great place, so close to everything.",location
Radu's place is great! It has everything you need for a short trip. The wifi is spotty but works for the most part. If you need to call an uber give yourself enough time since they have to get up the hill and will likely lose service (best to meet them outside!). The place is clean and easily accessible otherwise.,clean
Nice little place to stay in LA!<br/>Radu is a great host! Easy check-in and always fast responses!!<br/>Great time!,location
"Perfect place if you want to explore Hollywood,  close to everithing, quiet place, Radu is an excellent host and comunication was so easy.",location
Our stay was great as we expected. Just take care when driving into the parking lot without an SUV - there are some holes.,clean
House was good for a fast stay had everything we needed. It was really close to everything all the touristy areas so really cheap Uberâs.,location
"Situated in a lovely area in the Hollywood Hills. Perfect location for walking down the hill to Hollywood Boulevard and getting an Uber back! The apartment is as described and provides everything you need for a base to explore Los Angeles. Private parking, good directions and easy check-in/out is a bonus. Would definitely recommend.",location
"Ranuâs guest house is perfect for a solo traveler or couple who needs a quiet place to crash after sightseeing in Hollywood! Itâs in the hills but a quick 5 min ride down the hill to anything you could need in Hollywood! The unit was clean, comfy, and easy to find!",location
Radu's place is a really great place. Nice and quiet up in the hills. The room is big enough and it has a large bathroom. Good parking space for my car. It is close to pretty much everything.  I can really recomend this place and I hope to stay here again the next time.,location
"Radu's place was small, but perfect for 2. It was clean, the shower was good, and the only bad thing was the internet connection (but if you're a tourist, it's not so important).<br/><br/>Would definitely stay again! Thanks Radu.",clean
"Exactly as pictures show. Check in was effortless. Comfortable and private. Location was as described, Hollywood hills but only a few minutes in a cab to loads of restaurants and bars in Hollywood/ West Hollywood. Only feedback is that WiFi was slow, though not sure if thatâs just a general LA thing. Overall wouldnât hesitate to stay there again.",location
Very cozy space in an AMAZING location. Highly recommend if you want something out of the ordinary with a historical flare.,location
Great spot. Iâd stay here again.,location
"The place does look like how it appears in the pictures. Now for the parking spot, there are huge pot holes when pulling up into the drive way. I wish there was a warning or the host would of let us known beforehand. My partnerâs car sunk and hit the bottom of the potholes it was kinda hard to pull in and out of the driveway. If you have a small low car itâs best you donât park there. <br/><br/>We had the doors and windows closed and there were so many insects/bugs flying inside; it was not pleasant at all. <br/><br/>The WiFi kept buffering so it was slow and that was very frustrating. The microwave as shown on the picture is on a very tall closet, but personally I feel that is hazardous especially when taking out heated food. Itâs just such a strange place to put a microwave. <br/><br/>The place is very tiny, as said in the description itâs best for couples. Definitely no more than two people. <br/><br/>I spent Halloween weekend here so I did have music playing loudly for a while before going out to enjoy the night. The host messaged me saying âto wrap it upâ because he had work the next morning. Which I completely understand, but he could of chosen different words. Maybe kindly asking to turn it down, but âwrap it upâ just seemed a little out of pocket.<br/><br/>Overall the hostâs communication was good, the place was organized and clean.  If anything from this review doesnât sit right with you then maybe youâre better off looking for another stay.",clean
Was the perfect place for a quick getaway to the LA area. As described and just what we needed to be able to have a place to crash at night.,location
A very good location!,location
"We arrived late at night due to traffic delay. It was completely dark & creepy , we couldnât find the place. GPS showed we had arrived but we had to get off our vehicle (it was freezing cold)to search for the entrance. It was a small, tight space to turn into the porch with potholes (about 3?). Once u turn in, youâre fine. <br/><br/>The place is small but it looks like the pics shown in listing , just didnât expect it to be that small. The bed is not even a queen sized bed, more like a super single, it was squeezy for the 2 of us , for 8-9 nights, we didnât have a good sleep at all. Not to mention the heater provided was a small portable one, it was freezing most of the time for us. Even if u got the room warm, the toilet was freezing it was impossible to bathe without coming out shivering each time. <br/><br/>However , host was very responsive even though I texted him late into the night. He addressed the issues I faced, eg cannot lock the door when we were inside the room. Apparently u have to lock it from the inside and slam it shut. Not like our usual way of closing the door and then turning the lock. Felt unsafe, although Radu said it was a safe neighborhood . But still u know, we wanted to keep our belongings safe, whether or not itâs a safe neighborhood. <br/><br/>The washer and dryer. It was in the shed under the stairs outside the room, somewhere in the porch. We couldnât find it n texted Radu to ask. He responded promptly, however, the location n state that it was in, Iâd rather not use it. It was dusty n full of spider webs in the shed, plus , it looked like nobody ever uses it? We instead drove to the nearby laundry shop to have our clothes washed and tumbled dry. <br/><br/>Overall , the only plus point was that the Host responded promptly. I wouldnât stay there again. Place was too small and creepy especially at night .",location
"Small, cozy and well equipped studio in a quiet neighborhood. Perfect for a short stay in LA. Communication with Radu was easy and fast. Personal tip: If you come by a flat sports-car, you would better park at Kirkwood Dr (itâs allowed there) since the entry to the attached driveway is pretty rough and bumpy ;-)",space
"This apartment is perfect for a quick get-a-way to LA. Although it's not a huge space, it's in a great location and has everything you would need.",location
"If your in town with a full schedule or need a quiet getaway this is the place. Bang for the buck, clean, close to everything and quiet. Really enjoyed the easy parking situation.",location
The place was clean and the host was extremely hospitable. I would definitely stay again when visiting LA,clean
Awesome location! Nice people!,location
The location was great. Max was kind and gave us a good advices. Their two cats (Walley and Little Girl) were adorable. ,location
Great place right in the heart of the action. Max and Jenny were great hosts! ,location
"If you're looking for a quaint stay in the heart of Venice beach, look no further!",location
"Very comfortable home to stay in and in a great location! The hosts were very communicative, and provided everything we could need.",location
Would definitely recommend for anyone visiting Venice beach and looking to be very close to everything.,location
Everything good! Max was very helpful and Kind at arrival and departure.,clean
"Great value room in a very welcoming home! So close to everything you could want in a Venice stay- shops, restraints and of course the beach. Room is a fair size. Hosts are eager to help with anything they can. Takes around 1 hour 15 to get anywhere you would want to get to in LA (via public transport) like Beverly Hills and Hollywood. Only 15-20 dollar uber to LAX.",location
This place was very nice and host was friendly â¤ï¸âºï¸,clean
"My little son (3 years old) and I spent 3 nights. We woke up really early in the morning and arrived every day at 9 pm, so we didndt spent much time with Max or Jenny. We showed up earlier than the check in time and was ok to quickly leave our luggage, change clothes and go off sightseeing (we came from a 20 hour flight). The low pressure of the shower i didn't care, the bed suuuper confortable, location amazing. During the night some noise from the street. <br/>Max was really nice, Jenny not too talkable. They lent me a chair to go to the beach. I didnt know that breakfast was included. They didnt say me anything about it. And during one morning my son came with a dead mouse in his hands, because he founded in the kitchen. First i didnt notice it was a real mouse, seconds later i realized it was real and it was dead.. despite that the cleaning was allright.",clean
"Staying in this Hollywood Hills apartment was mostly a good experience. The location was great and the bed was comfortable. <br/><br/>There was just a few problems. Unfortunately the WiFi connection and cell service were so bad that I had to walk down the street to use my phone. The driveway had two holes and was very difficult to get in and out of. The apartment attached to this studio had a guest over and they shared the driveway for one night. It was difficult to maneuver around the other car and avoid the holes so I ended up parking down the street as I was afraid I would damage our rental car. <br/><br/>Overall, the apartment was clean and in a very cute neighborhood.",clean
"Excellent location, easy access to West Hollywood. Very nice accomodations, clean, and easy going host.",clean
Radu was very quick with responding which is always super helpful! The place was great for a quick weekend getaway. Location was fabulous with Ubers taking about 5-10mins to get to WeHo. Definitely would stay here again!,location
"Great little nest super close to all the hype of Hollywood, yet quiet and safe thanks to its location in the hills. I really enjoyed my stay there.",location
"Very quiet and fun place, great location in the Canyon, walk to the local coffee/deli/grocery. Room has all you need. Radu is a very responsible host with great communication and response to requests. Will recommend to everyone !",location
Great little place in a great neighborhood,location
"Perfect little spot in the beautiful Hollywood Hills, just a 5 minute drive from Sunset Strip. The apartment is quiet and peaceful. Check-in was easy, and Radu was very helpful and responsive throughout my stay. Would stay there again.",location
My friend and I stayed at Raduâs place for a weekend. It was in a great neighborhood and the location was perfect for our trip! Ubers were always available and cheap to get us where we needed. The space is definitely for 1-2 people and best for those needing a place to crash at night.,location
"Great location in the hills. Can walk to an outdoor espresso bar, can walk around the Hollywood hills. 5 minutes to everything on sunset strip.",location
Radu was always quick to respond and gave clear instruction on finding the location. The private parking was amazing as well. Quite and quaint location!,location
"If you need a quick stop by Hollywood for a couple nights this place does the job. Down the hill is all of the cool brunch and dinner spots of Hollywood. Keep in mind that if you plan to hang out and relax inside at the airbnb, that the wifi signal (which seems like it's just coming from the main house) is too weak to actually stream anything, and we tried for a good while. So just have your Netflix content downloaded to your tablet, or phone prior to arrival.",location
"Great location, near lots of great tourist spots and in quiet neighborhood.",location
"Radu's lower floor studio space was idyllic, the perfect place to land as I touched back after being away from L.A. for months.<br/>The home is just a short walk from Laurel Canyon General Store and the delicious Italian Restaurant, Pace, and just a hop, skip, and a jump from the main drag off Hollywood/Sunset in West Hollywood.  The spot in Laurel Canyon is tranquil and brimming with inspiring energy.  Day and nights walks through the neighborhood are filled with beautiful sights and sounds, and the air fills your lungs with vibrancy.<br/><br/>(just be aware that Wi-Fi in the studio space, and cell reception in this part of the Canyon are quite spotty.)<br/><br/>Overall the stay was a magnificent breath of fresh air!",location
"This was a great place to stay, close to a lot of the nice features of the city but with a nature feel to it.",location
"You get what you pay for. Perfectly acceptable for a base camp just to sleep and shower, but a little tiny to spend any extended time in. The lack of wifi was a bummer, but we expected it due to other reviews. All in all, perfectly acceptable place to crash.",price
"okay well lets see, I am going to write about my honest experience at this place. its just my honest opinion and in no way meant to be negative towards the host. so the place itself is quite small, very small. I think the photos make it seem bigger than it actually is, however it's adequate for two people. the apartment is directly below the main house and idk maybe it was a shed or something that was converted. It was not as clean as I expected it to be, in the ceiling were spider webs, there were a few ants here and there, I expect perhaps due to the location bugs can get in. there is a sliding door that leads into the bathroom, the door itself below the handle has a yellowish stain. thats kinda gross, didn't want to touch that. in the bathroom the trim on the floor seems to have mold or is just very dirty, the shower head is very dirty, looks like it has mildew growing within the spray nozzles. the water pressure was good and plenty of hot water, so that is a plus. in corners of the bathroom the wall is falling apart or it needs repairs, just very unsightly.<br/><br/>the bed wasn't great, seems to sink in the middle and not firm at all. looks real old and like the legs mite break if you weren't careful, same for the couch. very unstable couldn't even sit on it. now the apartment is in the Hollywood hills, a lot of the houses around there look very run down and not maintained at all, so maybe thats just the overall condition of these places and the normal vibe. antique run down vibes, maybe thats a thing that people are into. I thought it would be nicer being in the hills, I was wrong. there is zero cell phone reception in the area so you will not be able to use your phone and the apartment has no wifi. the host offers a wifi extender, so its an extension of the wifi in the main house, and its an extension of a 2G network. so you will not be able to use it for anything. so basically you are completely disconnected from the digital world. the driveway parking was actually very good. private parking as advertised. the entry to the driveway is paved with stones, the driveway itself is loose gravel. so be careful if you have a rental car. the roads going up to the house are super narrow and at nite there are no lights. so if driving just be careful. <br/><br/>overall I would say that the place has a very dingy feel to it and not comfortable at all. now if these things do not bother you and you are okay with these conditions then I would say to stay here. personally I would not stay here again. <br/><br/>I must say that Radu does communicate well and he also seems like a very nice person. I'm sure he would try to accommodate any guests to the best of his abilities. maybe in his eyes these conditions are normal and apart of maybe some kind of bohemian vibe. so again I am not trying to be negative to Radu, just want to express my honest opinion of the apartment. for under 100 bucks a nite I suppose its fair and that should be the quality expected especially for being in Los Angeles. so on my part for a future trip I will opt to spend much more on a hotel or more modern airbnb. <br/><br/>I will say thank you to Radu and to any future guests, if you guys are okay with the things I have mentioned then yes you should stay here, its a bargain find. it is close to a lot of shops and restaurants once you drive down the hill.",clean
Great awesome place up on the hills!!,location
Listing and previous reviews were accurate. Good place to rest after being out all day. Nice to have long iPhone chargers! Get what you pay for - perfect if on a budget.,location
"Clean, cozy little space for a short stay. The only issue was the wifi signal; it would often cut out. Great otherwise especially for the location/neighborhood. Host is kind. ð Thanks Radu!",location
"Radu's guest house is a small place but it's perfectly good for one person who needs a comfortable place to sleep in a great location. Laurel Canyon is a quiet neighborhood, and great places to dine can be found down the hill in Hollywood and West Hollywood. The guest house has a nice shower with ample amounts of hot water. Be aware that cellphone service can be a hit or miss in the canyon, but Radu does note that in his description. The WiFi did go out on me one night, but Radu was quick to respond after I reached out to him and he gave me a solution that worked out well. Overall, I would recommend Radu's property for the traveler that is looking for a quiet place in a unique neighborhood at a decent price.",location
Perfect little spot to decompress. Parking spot is a huge plus!,location
"Great location in Laurel Canyon for a person or couple to stay, if you're planning to be out and about most of the day and just need a place to sleep and shower. Pictures are accurate of what to expect. Check in and out was simple.",location
"This is an excellent choice if you are looking for a no frills place in the hills. The studio has all your basic amenities and a parking spot, which is really helpful in that area. I had some trouble with the wifi, but Radu was incredibly responsive and we got things working within the day.",location
Great value for a crash pad in a great location. Thanks Radu for the stay!,location
"Comfortable bed, very clean, private, and host is a good communicator. The internet was a bit slow, otherwise a great stay.",clean
"Small place but perfect for a quick trip, with 2 people. Clean and efficient. Good place to stay at if youâre out all day and come back to a comfy bed and cozy place to chill and sleep. Bathroom was amazing, great size and nice shower and the location was very cool, right in the middle of the Hollywood scene, just 10 minute drives to great spots all around. Service was not great but Netflix worked on the tv. 10/10 would come back! Had everything my girlfriend and I needed to enjoy our stay.",clean
"Great spot to crash, because it is surprisingly close to everything. Wifi is a bit slow, so just FYI. Comfortable and homey.",location

The room was clean and Radu communicated well and helped us with small conveniences (new batteries and extra pillows).  Good location and a nice space to spend a weekend,clean
Laurel Canyon is stunning. This place is exactly as described. I should add that I had no problems at all with the broadband as others suggested there was an issue.,clean
"This place is a great stay! I showed up super late at night and the owner already had the heat on in the room.  It was cold outside so I was very thankful!<br/>Spacious driveway to park in, hot shower, nice bathroom, coffee machine, fridge, couch.  I would highly recommend!",clean
Great stay in a great location,location
"This studio is perfect for couples or close friends as it is relatively small. However, it has everything you need. As it is located in the Hollywood Hills a car is necessary to get around. Radu was a nice and welcoming host. We would definitely book this studio again.",location
"Raduâs place Is definitely in the perfect location, great distance to all the hot spots without the hassle of paying an arm and a leg for an Uber/Lyft. The place was exactly how described. Very cozy and comfy, with AMAZING water pressure lol I would definitely stay again!! My husband and I loved it there!!",location

Lovely little guesthouse in the canyons. Very close to all of the Weho spots and walking distance to the Laurel Canyon cafe for morning coffee. Host was great and super responsive.,location
Great place! I stayed for a summer internship in Burbank and it was perfect.,location
"Susan is super helpful and I loved staying at her place. I took advantage of the fire pit quite a lot, and the orange tree smells amazing when in bloom. I will miss the cute lemon tree, tree-lined street so close the Chandler Bike Path, and Morrisonâs pub down the street (happy hour all day til 6pm!) <br/><br/>We will especially miss Astro and Wanda, Susanâs sweet rescued greyhounds. <br/><br/>The private entrance is great and if you have a dog, this is especially great for you because of the extremely secure backyard and double gates. <br/><br/>Thank you, Susan!",location
"I arrived to Susanâs place and it was not clean. There were yellow stains all over the spread and piles of dirt/dust in the corner. The desk chair had large stains. There were spots on the bathroom counter, a dirty rug, previous guests had left their bath loofah and face covering in the bathroom. These issues were very concerning to me considering COVID 19. Not to mention the host didnât interact with a face mask on which is in Airbnbâs guidelines. In addition, there was no way to secure the window as it didnât lock and could be pulled open.  I spoke with Susan about these issues and offered to pay up until that day and she agreed to figure out the numbers to see what I would owe. However, she proceeded to leave me outside waiting on her for over an hour. Upon contact with her she told me that she contacted Airbnb instead (which she could have came and told me). I left her house that day and had to get a hotel for the night. Getting refunded for a place that I never stayed in and wasnât properly prepared upon my arrival was a very lengthy process.",clean
"I recently stayed in this adorable Airbnb for almost 2 months. As a single woman I felt very safe in this neighborhood and surroundings. The owner of the Airbnb, Susan, was so wonderful and helpful. She greeted me upon my arrival and showed me everything in the Airbnb and was always available if I needed anything. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend this home.",location
"The studio was incredibly comfortable. Every little detail has been thought out, if I ever found myself looking for a bottle opener or anything, Susan had already provided one. The neighborhood is quiet and feels very safe, while also being walking-distance to a ton of restaurants and cafes, as well as Rite Aid and Target. Thereâs a bike path nearby great for afternoon walks. Susan was welcoming and communicative, and her greyhounds are the sweetest dogs ever. The studio is very private if you want it to be. Overall, a great little place to stay.",location
"Great spot at the Venice Canals and really close to the beach, too!",location
"Such and excellent location, and a home that feels like a home! Two blocks from Venice beach, and Abbot Kinney, can't get better than that.  The room felt cosy and well decorated and if you're a cat person you are in luck as they have two adorable and loveable kitties. Was told that the bathroom shower stream would be low as its an older house, but it was perfectly fine. Thanks again for letting us stay!",location
Nice little room and very good location.,location
Max is a really thoughtful host. His place is really cute I really enjoy my staying there.,location
"Terrific Place, terrific host, great neighborhood, definitely would recommendððð",location
Susan was accomodating and quite attentive. She has very dogs that are very kind and if you like outdoors the backyard is spacious. The area feels quite safe as with the entrance to the studio as well. Keep in mind that this studio is rustic as it shows in the photos. I felt the value was good and street parking is quite easy to find in front.,location
Susanâs place has everything you need for a long term stay! The neighbourhood is lovely and feels very safe and quiet. Susan was a great host and was always available if I needed anything or had any questions. I would highly recommend staying here!,location
"The best Airbnb experience. Susan is an amazing host. Easy to work with and very welcoming. The place is conveniently located and in the most picturesque neighborhood. Super safe. My 2 daughters really enjoyed staying in the unit, it had everything that they needed and they always felt comfortable. It was the best introduction to California living and the perfect launchpad! Highly recommend!!",location
"Where do I even start! I was shocked when I walked into the place. It didnât look like it has been cleaned AT ALL. There were spiders, spiders webs and dead bugs everywhere. ( I have pictures) There were rotten fruits and veggies in fridge and the fridge itself was very dirty ( Also have pictures). Even the vacuum filter was full and I had to empty it before cleaning the place myself. When I messaged her if she had any kind of spray to get rid of the spiders, she didnât not reply until a couple of days later so I obviously had to buy the spray myself and sprayed everywhere before I was able to even sit down in the place. While cleaning the place, I found an underwear in the closet ( also have picture)<br/>The bed side lamp didnât work. The table was broken and would make a terrible sound with the slightest movement so it was impossible to use it to study. <br/>Overall I did not feel welcomed. She didnât even provide one single toilet paper at least for the beginning. I wasnât expecting her to provide a full supply, but I was surprised to see the toilet paper holder empty. <br/>Communication is also definitely a big issue. She NEVER replied on a timely manner. It was always a couple of days before she got back to me if I needed something. So if anything is wrong, youâre basically on your own and canât rely on her. <br/>About the hot water: in the initial check in message , it said to let the water run a while before itâs hot enough and I thought it meant 5-10 min, but I was wrong. I always had to let the water run a good 20-30 min before Iâd get any hot water. <br/> I would obviously never go back there and do not recommend this place at all.",clean
"Everything was perfect. It was a clean living space, comfortable, and I felt safe staying there. The hostess would check on me occasionally to make sure everything was going well which was very appreciated.",clean
"Super cool airbnb! Went for a weekend for my bday and it was super close to everything we went to! Only 15 mins away from Universal Studios and less than 10 mins away to sunset blvd, hollywood blvd and others. I liked how clean it was and had a lot to provide! Definitely would come back and recommend!",clean
It's easier to back into the driveway rather than backing out.,clean
Cozy stay for 2 people and in a great location!,location
"This was my second stay in Radu's place. The location is perfect. It is close to everything. The neighbourhood is quiet. Good parkingspace for your car.

We will definately return to his place whenever we are in Los Angeles. I can highly recommend it.",location

"Welcome to Laurel Canyon. A little haphazard but lovely all the same, Raduâs studio apartment is comfortable and convenient. Check-in is a breeze and parking was as well. The studio is on the small side but is comfortable and has all the comforts of home. Bring a jacket because the canyon get chilly relative to the rest of LA.",location

Comfortable bed, reliable wifi and good shower (although it is very high, shorter people may struggle to reach it!)<br/>We walked in a few times which was very easy and only about 30/40 mins to the v busy/touristy bit of hollywood boulevard, WeHo neighbourhood, etc.",clean
Great spot nestled in the hills. Super quiet and clean with all the amenities you need,location
"a great place to stay for a couple, friends, or mom and teen daughter like we were! excellent location in Laurel Canyon. Studio is exactly as described and very comfortable. price is definitely a value esp considering location. the Roku tv was a nice touch and provided us with late night entertainment. area very quiet at night. I would absolutely stay here again.",location
Awesome location. Great for a short stay.,location
"There's no reception for Verizon and I had struggles with the wifi I don't know if was my phone or the internet, I would suggest to ask to Radu for the wifi password in advanced",location
Staying at Raduâs place was a great experience. Thank you!,location
The apartment has the perfect sice for 1-2 people. It was very clean and cozy. The location/area is very laid back and chill - its very good to calm after a day in the busy city. Radu is a tremendously nice guy. He allowed us to drop off our luggage earlier so we were able to explore LA. He also gave us tipps for LA and was very accommodating. 10/10!,clean
"perfect place in the best place in LA. <br/>Laurel Canyon is amazing. For those whom know Laurel Canyon no other words needed. Radu is a great host nice and helpful.<br/>Highly recommended, in the heart of Hollywood Hills and near to ""everything""!",location
Super interesting and special place to stay. Based on my schedule I didn't get to spend too much time with Victoria and Mark but they were super chill and friendly and Victoria even dropped me off at a workshop space I was teaching at. I highly recommend getting the tent which will also give you access to the spa room. The combination is so relaxing! It was probably in the 60s the night I was there but I stayed nice and warm with the bedding in the tent as well as the fact there was also a space heater. If I am back in Silver Lake I would stay here again!,location
Really nice place with cute cats! Perfect location right next to the beautiful canals and the beach! The Bed was comfy and the noise from the street wasn't loud at all. Would definitely come back!,location
This house's location is perfect for visitors to Venice! Thank you for your kindness and comfortable room.,location

We had a great time :) awesome house and cats,clean
"The apartment is in the perfect location for enjoying the Venice canals, the beach, and strolling along Abbot Kinney Blvd for a chi chi coffee. There is no heating in the apartment, so I personally found the room rather cold in the mornings and evenings.",location

"When I come back to LA the first AirBnB I will check on for availability is this one. Max and Jenni are so welcoming and friendly, communicate well, and are as accommodating as can be. On top of being wonderful hosts, they also show interest in the people who stay with them. Parking is easy to find, they have great tips to share for your travels, and everything is close and accessible! If you donât like cats, no worry, they usually keep to themselves but are super sweet! This is a perfect place for those who are on the move during their trip!",host
"We enjoyed our stay very much!! The apartment has a very clean and had a lovely warm feeling. The room was perfect for our 3 day stay. The bed is comfortable, everything was clean, bathroom fully supplied and the shower was nice and warm. We really appreciated the box in our room  with a few extra things we may need like a blow dryer or iron. We enjoyed a cup of coffee each morning before our day. And we love animals so it was very fun for us to be around such loving cats. We also loved then location. Just a short walk to Venice beach and everything around there and a cab ride to anywhere else we needed to go. We felt fully accommodated and would definitely stay here again! ",clean

"Julian and Patsy were excellent hosts. The studio is spacious, totally private, and there's even a nice backyard they gave us access to.  With just a short walk to restaurants and bars, and about 10 minutes by car to Santa Monica, this apartment was a fantastic choice for a quick stay-cation in Los Angeles. I would highly recommend staying here!",location
"I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to pacific palisades.  Julian and his wife were very friendly and helpful in accommodating us all week.  The place is exactly like the pictures, which is very nice to know. It's quaint, but clean and comfortable.  The internet works great, parking is very easy and location to town is top notch.  Walked to coffee shops in the morning and to several different dining establishments in the evenings.  I would recommend this place to anyone not needing a ton of space, you won't be disappointed.  ",clean
"This was our first airbnb experience (and a last minute booking) and I cannot say enough about how Julian's prompt and kind communications were greatly appreciated.  Julian and his vibrant wife, Patsy, welcomed us to their Garden Pied-a-Terre which, while exactly as described, felt much more spacious than we expected.  Located in a lovely neighborhood walking distance from restaurants, grocery stores, and other activities, the area is pleasantly quiet both day and night.  <br/><br/>If you want to be closer to the beach than the hub-bub of other parts of LA while having access places like the 3rd Street Promenade that offer a variety of food and shopping opportunities, you cannot find a better place at such an amazing price!  ",location
"Very easy and fast communication with host! Great location, beautiful area. Room fits description well. And make sure to visit the gorgeous beach just minutes away!",location
"Super cute guest house. I would recommend Julian and Patsy's space to anyone visiting the LA area. My husband and I loved that it was just a short walk away from countless shops, cafÃ©s, and restaurants. Santa Monica beach is also within walking distance (about 40 mins).  Beautiful, quiet neighborhood. Our only minor issue was parking; however, the street parking opens up in the evenings. Also, the bed is full sized which was not a problem for us (we're both under 5'8"" and average sized), so just be aware of that. Overall, it was a sweet, peaceful stay. Our hosts were great and were easy to communicate with! Grateful they accepted us about 3 hours before we arrived!",location
Had the pleasure of staying in Juliann and Patsy's guest  house it was styled mid century modern very spacious. And a friend in the middle for me to do yoga. It had a lot of light <br/>and  a skylight in the bathroom. My favorite of all was the garden outside with tables chairs great place for me to face time my friends and family. And it smelled so good! Parking was a breeze no problems at all!<br/><br/>Maria ,location
"We stayed at Julian's studio for 3 days around Easter and enjoyed the unit. It is centrally located, quiet and clean . The owners are helpful and the only negative we had was the double bed which was not very comfortable. However, we were informed that it is in the process of being replaced. Other than that, a tv might be a good addition to the overall appeal of the unit.<br/>Al and Jeannette,Scottsdale,AZ",clean
So hospitable and accommodating! Would book this again for sure!,clean
Super nice location to stay in Venice Beach. The house is close to the canals and the room is also comfortable. Recommended!,location
"Nice place, near to beach. Highly recommended.",location
"A lovely little room near the beach. Public transportation options near by. The only thing is that rideshares donât know how to get to this place, so you either guide them through it or get dropped off at the corner of Dell & S Venice. Most variety of restaurants & bars are south at Washington & Pacific, use Yelp. The canal walkway is a great way to get there, or use Culver City green bus to get there. This part of town isnât car parking friendly. The hosts are great communicators and their cats are sweet.",location
Lovely home. Walking distance to Venice Beach (5min walk). Great location/ close to food places/stores. Cheap uber/lyft ride going to Santa Monica Pier. Comfy bed. Would stay again!,location
"Place was great, Jenny and Peter were very welcoming. Didn't see them<br/>Much after that as I was out and about for most of my stay but would definitely stay here again",location
The hosts description is 100% accurate. Itâs difficult to get to using gps and parking isnât the easiest on Monday and Tuesday due to street sweeping. The room is very cute and the bed was comfortable. All linens had a great fresh scent and once you know where you are the location is one of the most prime locations in the Venice area. Definitely would recommend if youâre in the Venice area.,location
"Comfortable, clean and close to everything I needed. Thanks for hosting. Sandra<br/>",clean
"Julian was prompt in all of his responses. Great neighborhood. Walking distance to lovely restaurants, Starbucks and shopping. Beautiful garden with happy humming birds in the day and hooting owls in the night.",location
I had a great stay at Julian's Garden Pied a Terre. It was fun to visit with Julian and his wife and talk about the way the Palisades use to be when I grew up there. The location is perfect! It is one block to town and all that the Palisades has to offer. The Pied a Terre is spacious and very comfortable. I'm sure I will stay there again. ,location
"What a great experience staying at Julian's guesthouse-it was very relaxing and delightful.  Everything was as described or better.  The nice yard was a plus and added to the overall comfort.  I had to overnight a box the day before I travelled and Julian was very accommodating with that last-minute request.   It was a great safe neighborhood, and I would love to stay there again.",location
Nice room on a right place. Close to Malibu and Santa Monica...<br/>Kind people.,location
I had another great stay at Julian's place. It is the perfect Palisades location and he makes everything very easy and accommodating. I'm sure I will be back soon. ,location
Basic two-star accommodation. You need a car to stay here though two blocks away are great eateries and the Sunday morning Farmers Market is great for food and sampling. ,location

"Julian made my wife and I feel welcome by meeting us when we arrived and giving us a short tour of the property and informing us of nearby restaurants and grocery stores. The listing description was very accurate and the house was located in a very beautiful and safe neighborhood.  Although most recommend a car in LA (and the surrounding areas), we utilized the number 9 bus, but did remain close to the coast. We would both highly recommend this listing for anyone looking to stay in the Santa Monica area.",location
My mother stayed here for a trip to the pacific palisades and had a wonderful time. The apartment is just as described and she would definitely stay here again on future trips.,clean

The location was good and quiet.",clean
It was a wonderful stay!  We were in town for a wedding and the place was great.  Very peaceful and relaxing.  Julian and his family were very responsive and easy to communicate with.  I would definitely stay again.,location

Julian was very attentive and made sure he was there to greet me upon my arrival.  Everything in the room was in great condition..

I would definitely stay there again.   <br/><br/>he also made sure to let me know of local events going on in the area in case I was looking for something to do.. ,clean
"This was a perfect Airbnb experience.  Our hosts were willing to accommodate our early morning arrival and early morning departure, and provided some helpful tips on things to do nearby (e.g. farmer's market).

The tent was surprisingly warm even on chilly nights, especially with the heat lamp on.  It was super cozy and the hanging lights were a nice touch.  I couldn't recommend this place enough and Victoria is a wonderful host!  Hope to come again!",location
Victoria is a super host! Literally! They welcomed us with open arms and provided all the necessary essentials for an over night stay. I slept in the luxurious glamping tent outside and it was one of the best sleeps OF MY LIFE. In the morning I could see the Hollywood sign and Victoria made us breakfast in her cozy home. Book with Victoria! You will regret nothing :),location
A great stay in a unique spot! The views are as amazing as the pictures and the place is shockingly private for a rooftop in a metropolis.,location
"The rooftop was definitely dreamy and the view was amazing. Victoria was a great host and had a Lot of cool decorations in her house. Only catch was a pretty scary electrical storm in the morning, and suddenly we were up high in a metal tent and it was terrifying. So just make sure you check that the whether is nice before booking the outdoor room! ",location
Fun time. Lovely home. Not a ton of privacy as other guests would come up at night onto the rooftop where the tent is located...also jacuzzi was unavailable because that area was rented by another guest. Vic was easy going and very nice.,location
We loved Victoria's home. It was as described and the views were gorgeous over LA. ,location
"The space is just as described. It was different and fun and a last minute reservation. The views are amazing with downtown LA, Griffith Park and the Hollywood sign! I only wish I was staying longer. Victoria is a very interesting host and joined us for Sushi. ",location
"I had a fantastic stay with Victoria and Mark. They were extremely kind guests, helpful, full of advice and very interesting! It was a unique and fun experience staying in the tent- I had an incredible nights sleep and the views were brilliant. The house is really well situated for Silver Lake with some really handy steps just by the house taking you right into the action. And Uber to take you home so you don't have to climb them! I'd really recommend it.",location
Charming tent on a rooftop with incredible views of LA. It was very peaceful and the weather was perfect for sleeping outside. It was easy to get around since it was centrally located. Highly recommended!,location
My stay on this rooftop was great! Amazing view. I never saw the jacuzzi so make sure you ask about it! I didn't meet the hosts until I was checking out but they were so friendly and had tons of suggestions of places to eat.<br/>The only hiccup I experienced was that there was nobody home when I arrived at around 7PM. I waited about 45 minutes until a friend arrived to get me settled in. The room was not made or ready. There were many past guests belongings/glasses left behind.  Overall it didn't affect the rest of my stay!,location
"Really pleasant experience. Was our first time AirBnbing in a private room so we werent sure how our first experience would be. You enter the property through a gate at the end of a curved road (easy to miss it). Right when you walk through the gate, you feel the warm laid back vibe. Beautiful murals cover the walls. When we walked in we were greeted by Mark, whos super friendly and seemed very interesting. He told us the house rules and showed us around. Every process seemed very organized and there were nice little reminders hanging just incase you forgot.<br/><br/>The view on the roof was beautiful, theres a nice table with stools in the corner along with some nice chairs and a hammock to lay out in. All in all, awesome experience and Vic and Mark were really welcoming and easy to talk to!",clean

They also gave us some great tips about good restaurants and bars, as well as for our ongoing trip to Austin and New Orleans. Silverlake is a fun place to stay, lots of good places to go just a short walk away.",location
Victoria and Marc were both very knowledgeable about Los Angeles and were very helpful to make sure I enjoyed my week in Silver Lake and the wider city. <br/><br/>The view from the deck is quite beautiful.,location
"Victoria was great. The house, rooftop, and tent were so cool. The pictures don't do the view justice. All the amenities she provided were great and it was a really nice feeling knowing where you were going ""home"" to at the end of the night. We ate out for every meal and didn't spend too much time there during the day because Silver Lake is such an awesome part of LA to explore. If you're feeling adventurous you should definitely book it!",location
"A really unique place to stay in LA, your very own rooftop paradise with an incredible view out over the city. An oasis amidst the bustle! Victoria was sick when I visited, so we didn't have much contact, but she made my arrival easy and was quick to respond to queries.",location
This was a wonderful place to stay! Great location. The hosts were very accurate and up front about everything to expect staying there,location
Perfect for Venice Beach,location
Very friendly hosts that respected our privacy. Extra friendly cats that didnât but were really cute and able to move. The neighbors were loud late at night for a short time. Location of the home was perfect - 8 min walk from the beach. Weekday parking was not hard to find nearby but we had to move our car between the hours of 7:30 and 9:30 Tuesday morning.,location
Everything is like it says in the description. The place is perfectly located and the house has everything you need! We had a very nice stay!,location
"Amazing location!! Lovely hosts, comfy bed, hot shower - wish we stayed longer. The room is a bit small but you don't want to spend much time in a bedroom when you have all of venice on your doorstep! Thanks for a great stay.",location
This spot was unbelievably perfect. The location canât be beat and the room itself is touched by lovely little features that give it a homey vibe. I couldnât have been more comfortable. The next time Iâm in Venice Iâm wasting no time hunting for different AirBnBs. THIS is the place I want.,location
"Nice place to stay, close to Venice beach, parking available outside. <br/>The host was very reactive and provided with all the necessary details. <br/>Good value for money. I would definitely recommend this place !",location
Notbad. It is a little cold in the balcony,location
"Victoria has created a truly unique and awesome experience. The views from the top deck are incredible. Staying in the tent was awesome, no problems with weather or noise or anything like that. The bathroom is downstairs and inside the house from the bathroom, which is potentially annoying if it is the middle of the night, but not really a big deal. I will absolutely stay here again next time I'm in LA. Great find. Victoria is also very hospitable and welcoming and a great host. Thanks!",location
It was so special staying in this beautiful tent. Both the tent and the house are so nicely decorated and Marc and Victoria are 2 lovely persons. Really liked the neighbourhood and of course the view. Hope to be able to come back one day!,location
"Vic was welcoming and responded quickly.   The place was gorgeous inside and out. The view was amazing, and the room was cozy and warm. I would definitely return, and made my first night in LA very memorable. Thank you!! ",location
"The rooftop tent experience was great, it was just what my trip to L.A. needed.  It's located atop a hill overlooking the greatest little gem of a neighborhood, Silverlake.  It was comfortable, cool, and interesting with an absolutely breathtaking view of the entire city.  <br/><br/>Personally, I did not find there to be any surprises; it fit the description very closely.  It's a swanky tank on a rooftop balcony.  The night I stayed there was a light rain; however it did not get inside.<br/><br/>Once inside the tent you could be in distant persia or a high end burning man abode.  Thank you Vicky for a great experience.",location
Had a great experience at Victoria's rooftop tent. Great layout and views of the city. Very friendly and hospitable. This was my first time using Airbnb and it was one I will always remember.,location

There is a really cute brunch place called Vida walking distance from the house, and a fun farmers market on Sunday's (where you can spot celebs). <br/>Julian and his wife were so nice and accommodating. I definitely recommend this place! ",clean
After a warm welcome we were happy to see the room exactly the way it was described and were also happy to have the village just a short block away.  During our visit it was easy to come and go comfortably with easy access to the private detached room.

Finally; it was nice to meet such warm and friendly hosts.,location

Amazing place for the price. Noisy is an understatement though. The room is located rught above the  sidewalk and main travel road.

"This is a wonderful property in a superb location, with the friendliest and most gracious of hosts.  I am a frequent visitor to Pacific Palisades and have stayed at this property seven times during the course of the past year.  <br/><br/>Julian is always very welcoming helpful and available.  This accommodation is a completely separate self-contained building from the main house, affording total privacy and is extremely comfortable, spacious and warmly furnished.  the neighborhood is also a free and safe place to park.<br/><br/>The location is ideal.  It is one block from the Palisades Village with boutique shops, restaurants and supermarkets.  The house is a five minute drive to Will Rogers State Beach which is the quintessential L.A. beach scene and a further few minutes drive down the coastal highway to Santa Monica.<br/><br/>Overall this is a really comfortable private place to stay in one of the nicest, safest and friendliest locations in LA.  This is excellent value and I highly recommend.  <br/><br/>",location
"Julian is a wonderful host!  He met us when we arrived and showed us around the room.  He provided everything we needed for a weekend of watching golf at Riviera County Club during the Northern Trust Open.  This is a neighborhood gem - there were a number of great restaurants within walking distance, quiet surroundings, and plenty of nearby parking.  Once we parked the car each day we had everything we needed within a 3 block walk.  A Great place to stay for a quiet, fun weekend in Pacific Palisades! ",location

"I have stayed with Julian before and he welcomed me back once again. It is a perfect location to just walk out the door and into the village atmosphere of Pacific Palasades with wonderful shopping and also a short walk to Temescal Canyon Park. I love that it is a separate and fully contained guest house, everything that I needed was readily available, clean and warm.<br/><br/>Thanks Julian!!",location

"We had a really nice few days at Pacific Palasides, at Julian's<br/>Fantastic location, great little studio, friendly hospitality - we'd go back anytime :-)",location
"Our staying at Julian's place was awesome. Place very clean (which I think is the most important thing) It was so nice to find brand new soap and shampoo in the shower :) we had bottles of water, a small fridge to store our drink and food, heat and a fan available. there is no kitchen but plenty of store are all around the block with a delivery service for some. The place is independent and we felt very private. Location and neighborhood was perfect for us, commuting to Santa Monica (10min) every day: very quite and peaceful. Parking not always in front of the house. Julian and family always available and ready to help.",clean
"It was a pleasure meeting Julian and his wife (and, briefly, his son). They occupy the main house on the property and were available to deal with any special needs. ",location
"Charming, peaceful little apartment with easy street parking!",location

Incredible gem in the heart of the Palisades. The space is immaculate. The hosts are awesome.,location
We had stayed at Julian's in the past and the location and convenience of this unit made our trip to the Palisades very easy and smooth. The place was clean and comfortable.,clean
"Highly reccomend our stay at Julians apartment. It was very clean and comfortable, absolutely private. The area is just five minutes (by car) away from the Santa Monica pier.",location
"Owner greeted us when we arrived, and also during our visit, and when we left. One spacious clean room with separate new bath in free-standing guesthouse (with key) behind their home. Queen bed, wifi, quiet residential neighborhood, walk to Palisades Village shopping, and not far from beach. Perfect for my husband and I walking 5 blocks to visit our new baby grandson, daughter & son-in-law. We were happy and would return!",clean
Everything was as promised and Julian was there to show me what I needed to know. A very quiet and comfortable place--though I'd have loved it a hair more if there had been a coffee maker.,clean
"Julian and Patsy had welcomed us into their space and are very nice. They have settled us in and then gave us peace, only to communicate through AirBnb which we prefer. Parking was not a problem and the space is very easy to freely enter and leave without disturbing the hosts.<br/><br/>The space that is located in the garden is very nice and peaceful,<br/>it has everything that we needed including a fridge which we really needed for my partners insulins so we was happy with that. The location is great, right next to the main areas for the shops, food stores, the market and points of interest. The space is nice and clean, spacious with a well built shower room, storage was available and comfy bed too. <br/>",location
"Julian is a superb host! My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at their place. It was quiet, clean, safe, and relaxing. The best part about their place is that you can walk to some great local restaurants, and to a farmer's market nearby. Wonderful neighborhood with a close drive to the beach. We Highly recommend them!",location
"Julian was very welcoming host. Showed around the place and it was as shown in the pictures, clean and cozy.<br/>We were happy with the place. No need for AC because the climate is great, warm during the day and cool during the late evening / night.<br/>Short drive to the beach (we mostly went to Santa Monica & Venice).<br/>Parking available near, sometimes right in front.  Supermarkets (groceries & daily stuff) within walking distance from the place.<br/>We would definitely recommend Julian's place if you have planned to stay around Santa Monica & Venice.",clean
"Julian's place was exactly as described and suited us well for our short stay in the area. It's within walking distance of shops and restaurants in the little Palisades town, which is very nice. We would recommend this listing for short stays if you want privacy and don't need to rent a full apartment/house.",location
"This was a fine small place in the quiet back yard of the hosts' house.  Everything went as planned, and it was exactly as described--a comfortable single room at the end of the garden.  Clean and just perfect for a quick stay in Pacific Palisades. ",clean
"Julian's place is great! And he's a great guy as well. The space is very comfortable and quiet, with a great bathroom and walk in shower, and a complete wall full of books... I never had a problem finding parking on the street, and it's a 3 min walk to downtown Palisades, great sushi and other food options... There is also a highly rated on Yelp dry cleaner walkable as well. There is a nice backyard area with table and four chairs that Julian invite me to use at anytime. You can access the unit without disturbing the house, and you can leave the main door open for breeze... All the way around a great place to stay, with great people, in a great area. I would definitely stay there again!",location
We booked the tent last minute and Victoria was quick to respond and very accommodating. The tent was INCREDIBLE and it had a GORGEOUS view of the city. I will definitely be coming back to stay in this magical space again!,location
Victoria was friendly and helpful. Such a unique and lovely place to stay.,location

"This place was completely amazing, from the people hosting it to the view outside! My girlfriend and I had a great and memorable night here and it truly is romantic.

Thanks Victoria! :)",location

Victoria is great. The place is amazing. Great place for real easy LA,location
"To be honest, we had a lot of awesome airbnb's experiences  around USA these two last months during our Road trip but this one was disappointing . First, we had unfortunately a car accident on the highway to victoria's home (at around 1:30 from her home) We had to pass the night at the hospital. We booked two nights at Victoria's home and we explained her our situation and asked her if it was possible to report our stay to the two nights after. She refused because she don't accept last minute cancellations (circunstances were exceptionals, Right?) . Moreover wer had the feeling that she was cynical  because she told us to take a valium and to not disturb the house when we arrive. So after 14 hours at the hospital we had to come to her home (it was 7 am) otherwise we had to pay the night we didn't sleep.<br/>When we arrived we were amazed of the original decoration  and the wonderful view. Unfortunately, the ""second night"" was unpleasant. A lot of noise for a nice place that appears like a quiet area ! <br/><br/>It was a little bit dirty and sincerely too expensive for what it really is. It's not a yurt, it's an opened tent without bottom so  don't be surprised if insects are inside! We use to do camping  so we should use maybe this solution (it would be cheapest and unsurprisingly) ! Moreover there was no breakfast for our second morning... It's not a problem for us to not have the breakfast but if it's said on the description, we can wait for it! <br/>Like it's said on the description, Restrooms are in the house and you have to walk a little bit and use downstairs to go there and cross the home. It s not very pratique at night!<br/>Finally, we didn't feel really welcoming... However, Victoria seems to be a sympathic person and suggested us some places to visit! ",host
This was an incredible place. Like a total escape from the hustle and bustle of LA. The tent was beautiful and very romantic. The sunset views were spectacular. I would definitely stay here again! They were so friendly and hospitable and left us to do our own thing as well. My gf loved it too and we're definitely coming back again. Highly recommended. It's not too far from Silverlake cafes and bars as well. Such a good location. ,location
"Victoria and Mark have a very beautiful home in a great location!! The rooftop lodging was perfect for my stay, and the view is beautiful. Victoria had amenities that were very accommodating and she was nice enough to lend me her charger a few times after I forgot mine. I would love to stay here again sometime and definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a quiet getaway. Thank you, Victoria! ",location
"Wow! What an awesome spot. Definitely the best views of the city from the roofdeck. This cozy comfy tent was warm and homey, and within walking distance to plenty of fun spots. We had a blast exploring the neighborhood, watching the sunset, and meeting Victoria. She's a sweet host with easy house rules to follow, and truly the best location. I will book again!",location
Best Airbnb experience ever! Victoria and mark were great hosts and the room/view was incredible. Hopefully I end up back in LA so I can book again!,location
"Victoria and her place were amazing. Such a welcoming host made us feel right at home, and staying on the roof deck with the great view of LA beneath you was fantastic!<br/><br/>They have a grill on the deck which we made use of to cook up some fresh burgers and enjoy a nice bottle of wine under the stars and over the city lights. Their entire place has a calm, comfortable and cool feel, which almost feels a world away from the craziness of LA.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a unique experience, this place is it for you! Highly recommended",location
"Great last minute stay! The view, the deck, the tent, the host. All great! Would def stay again. Truly an adventure!",location
Love everything about the tent. Feng Shui level 100000,clean
"We really enjoyed the tent at the terrace, which is just beautiful. However you should be aware, that the house is s very social space with several tenants, who is also allowed to use the terrace - we found that a bit challenging during evening and morning hours, as we did not know. The people are all very nice, but one evening there was a small party at the terrace when we got back ready for sleep, and the morning after we got woken up by another tenant speaking heavily on the phone. An introduction to that circumstance would have been nice.",location
We have had a great and very interesting experience staying at Victoria's. The tent is fantastic! The vista over LA is incredible and Silver Lake is a nice area to stay at.,location
"Best place to stay in LA. Will not stay anywhere else. Great views and great hosts. Victoria is very organized and has tons of items, coffee, and tea for you to share. They are great hosts, and we had a wonderful stay. Cannot say enough about the bedroom and the view from the terrace. Unreal!",location
What a fun place to stay while in LA. Views are incredible and the bed was super comfy. ,location
"A wonderful, almost unreal, experience spending 3 nights in this cozy, colourful tent. Located in a very peaceful neighborhood. Amazing view from the rooftop. Vic is very thoughtful and provides you with pretty much all the amenities you'll need. <br/>",location
"Victoria's rooftop tent was a highlight of my trip to LA! The view was spectacular, the tent was cool and comfy, and Victoria and Mark are excellent hosts. I would definitely recommend staying here. I also enjoyed being within easy walking distance of Silver Lake bars and restaurants, as well as Echo Lake Park. ",location
"This space is fantastic. It felt like a little sanctuary in the middle of the city. Victoria and Mark are hospitable and warm- totally welcoming you into their space while at the same time giving you room to be on your own. Had everything you could need - towels, water, toothbrush and open access to tea and coffee. I rented a bike and kept it inside their yard and it was no problem - a great home base to explore Silver Lake and Echo Park with easy access to the rest of LA. <br/><br/>The only downside I can think of is middle of the night bathroom travels (it's in the main house and you need your key) but it really doesn't take much away from experience. <br/><br/>Would highly recommend this to a solo or couple travelers. If I ever come back I'll definitely be here again. <br/><br/>",location
"Pros: Location, beautiful view, glamping experience, comfy bed, interesting hosts<br/><br/>Cons: While the place really is amazing (second time staying here),  communication at times with Victoria felt tense and unwelcoming.",location
Such a great place for musicians and creative people to relax at,location
Loved the stay here !! Awesome down to earth creative neighbourhood with hosts and Airbnb to match. Tent was set up so nicely and our view overlooking the city was stunning. Would definitely recommend this as a retreat to step out of the craziness of being a tourist in LA ,location
"Victoria's place was awesome. A friend and I needed and place to stay in LA for a few days and we were blown away. The view was incredible, the ""tent"" was super comfortable and Victoria was a great host. Victoria's place is perfect if you're looking for a centrally located glamping experience.",location
"Was very enjoyable staying at Victoria's place , the tent was nice and interesting. I love the decoration of the tent and the house. The host really has a good taste on it. The location was good which was about 15mins by Uber to the Hollywood and downtown. ",location
This place was super nice.  The terrace with the tent was amazing. Victoria was a nice host that helpt us with everything and gave us some great tips for the area. ,location

Victoria and mark were very welcoming! They made sure they gave a thorough induction into the space and very kindly offered tea. The tent was a magic zone with great lighting and the view was a pleasant suprise. Thank you! ,location
Victoria's rooftop tent is an idyllic retreat that easily surpasses the comfort & privacy described in the listing. <br/>The care and attention that has gone into transforming an outdoor enclosure into a cozy and lavish abode is evident & makes for a wonderfully unique getaway with a superb location near Echo Park. ,location
Fantastic night get away with amazing views of the city! ,location
"My girlfriend and I stayed at Victoria's tent/rooftop space for a couple nights in November and it was great! The weather was perfect, high 70s in the day, cool in the evenings. Victoria explained everything we needed to know and we also learned a bit about the neighborhood's history from her which was neat. The photos don't do the views justice - absolutely incredible view of downtown LA, Silverlake and the Hollywood sign. The rooftop is so relaxing, you'll definitely want to make time to take in some sunrises or sunsets with a glass of something :) Only thing to note would be the bathroom is shared and you need to walk downstairs and through the living room every time you need it. Not a problem for us but if you find you need a lot of bathroom time (prep or otherwise) this might not be the ideal situation for you. Happy travels!",location
"Took my girlfriend here for her birthday and she couldn't have been happier. It's a beautiful, serene, and romantic spot overlooking the LA streets. The tent and house are masterfully decorated and made the stay feel like a quick getaway to another world, one with an abundance of peace. The hosts were great, very welcoming and kind. They have thought of everything that a guest would need in a tent and more. Our favorite AirBnb by far!",location
Only was here for one night but what a great place! Anyone would be happy to stay here! ,location
This place is such a gem amongst the city! Up in the hills over looking all of LA as you are nestled in a relaxing deck/tent in the trees. It is such a unique and special place to spend time at. Victoria was so sweet and extremely accommodating. She is so organized and has really thought of every single detail to make your stay smooth and comfortable. We will definitely be back! ,location
"Very cool spot to stay, close to great food options, amazing view. The house is streamlined for guests with notes and policies. Victoria and Mark are very friendly, don't be too intimidated by the house rules.  In the chance there is rain it gets a tiny bit damp but still sleepable and well worth it.",location
"My wife and I had an absolutely amazing time staying in the tent at Mark and Victoria's place from New Year's Eve until January 4th. The view from the deck is nothing less than spectacular and basically felt private to us throughout our stay. The mattress was so comfortable that we couldn't stop talking about what amazing sleep we were getting each morning when we woke. Their house is located perfectly to everything ""L.A."" you would want to go to and lies in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood. <br/><br/>If you enjoy camping like we do, then I highly recommend this wonderfully unique ""camping"" experience for your next visit to L.A.   <br/><br/>2 big thumbs up! ",location
"Great view from the deck and a very comfy bed inside the tent. We were there in January and were still warm enough overnight. Unique, cool vibe. Bathroom setup inconvenient as advertised. Victoria expects a lot from her guests, which may rub some people the wrong way, but we enjoyed ourselves very much and she was quite accomodating. Would definitely recommend for a unique AirBnB experience. ",location

Loved  the view and hospitality will be staying again great space!,location
"Our stay at Victoria's rooftop terrace was truly a highlight of our trip. It was our first experience ""glamping"" and tremendously exceded our expectations as it was incredibly comfortable! Victoria made us feel right at home with bathroom and kitchen access in her home. And last but certainly not least, the views are a sight to remember. She most definitely meets super host status for her dedication to hospitality. We are so grateful and hope to be back soon :-)",location
"Awesome stay. If it's not too cold, this is great for a night. Bed was really comfy, THE VIEW is incredible. A little bit pricy to basically sleep outside but I definitely get it. <br/><br/>Victoria checked us in late at night which was much appreciated, and was very pleasant and hospitable.

They even had a cappuccino machine and a large assortment of tea. I felt right at home. Also, Victoria was very nice and hospitable.",location

Great alternative style for the Bohemian traveler.,clean
"Victoria's rooftop tent was very unique and has a fantastic view of the city. The amenities were readily available for us to use. As we did not know that there would be other guests staying on the property as well, our only concern was the lack of privacy as anybody had access to the rooftop, therefore our tent as well. But we did not have any issues through out our stay! Victoria was a great host and gave us a very informative and thorough tour when we arrived :)",location

"This is an amazing Airbnb! I stayed here with my significant other and we truly enjoyed the sunrise and sunset views. The bed itself, tent/canopy and temperature (since this place is not inside) were very comfortable. I would recommend this place for 1-2 nights if you want to explore Silverlake and the surrounding area. The shared bathroom was fine, there are a lot of rules, but mostly just basic courtesy (and I loved the post-its because I'm pretty forgetful lol). The hosts were very kind and were available if we needed anything- the perfect mix between being present and giving you space. Overall I think this is a great Airbnb for awesome rooftop views, and access to a really cool area.",location

Comfy and trippy tent with gorgeous night view. Victoria was very informative and friendly. Make sure you bring your own water though~,location
Cool views,location
Me and my friend had an amazing stay in Los Angeles and Victoria's place was one of the key factors in this. The house is located in a lovely and exciting neighbourhood and the space itself is cosy and well arranged even if very relaxed. Victoria's thorough descriptions and house rules also made the stay comfortable â they helped us to know exactly how things work. Even if it was cold outside we slept so well in the tent because the mattress was heated. And the view outside the tent is just stunning. I would very much recommend this place to anyone who understands that it's a shared house and the rules serve to make everyone feel comfortable. I would like to stay again if I go back to LA!,location
"Thanks Vic and Mark- we had a great stay at your bohemian abode! <br/><br/>The rooftop has amazing views of the city and is perfect for watching the sunset or a morning cup of coffee. When we arrived the hosts gave us a tour and showed us how to use the heater, lights, etc. You do have to go downstairs and into the house to use the restroom. The tent itself was very warm, comfortable, and stylish. <br/><br/>There are tons restaurants and bars within walking distance. Vic can help you narrow it down if you're looking for a certain food or vibe.<br/><br/>You can tell that Vic and Mark love their home and their neighborhood- thanks for sharing them with us!",location

Located near many great eateries and shops.  If you've got a notion that you want a taste of Bohemian chic, this is a MUST.",location
"The tent is a cool fun space in an excellent location. Hosts were friendly, and the deck is a great place to hangout. The bathroom can get a little busy, but not a huge deal.",location
Great location. Nice and cozy tent definitely recommend!,location
"What an amazing space! It was perfect for us after returning from a 3 week road trip through the Baja. A tent atop a rooftop deck was bedecked with gorgeous fabrics, a stunning view and thoughtful extra touches. <br/>Victoria was there to check us in exactly when we arrived and took us on a tour of the place. Great communication and detailed instructions that we appreciated. <br/>Close to downtown LA and the beaches. Many thanks!",location
"We had a nice stay at Julian's AirBnB unit.  The room was as described, cozy, clean, private, and in close proximity to restaurants, grocery store, the beach, and ice cream.  The neighborhood is safe, walkable, and there was ample street parking.  Our weekend was extremely warm, and though the room did get awfully warm, the fan kept things manageable.<br/><br/>Check in was a breeze, and communication with Julian was easy and thorough.  I would highly recommend staying at this unit, and next time I'm in the Palisades, I will try to stay here again.  ",clean
We appreciate the privacy. Everything was clean. The location was very quiet. ,clean
"The space was efficient but comfortable for my son and myself. Access to the beautiful yard outside was very nice. Comments about parking are valid, so it may be easiest to drop off baggage then find parking if arriving during the day. Each day when I got back in the evenings I had no trouble getting a spot in front. The neighborhood was great with restaurants and shops within a block as well as a grocery store and pharmacy. The area had a wonderful small town vibe with tree-lined streets, something I didn't expect in LA! From there it's just a short jaunt to the nearest beach. Overall it was just a great place to stay for our short time there!",location
everything was perfect! the neighborhood is wonderful and quiet and the place is really nice for a couple but also for a solo. highly recommended,location
"The description was accurate. The room was nice, cozy. Very pleasant stay overall. Nice neighborhood as well. Only issue is that the room did not have air conditioning - only a fan. This was something of a problem given the heat.",clean
"My host(s) were easy-going when traffic between Utah and California delayed my arrival and welcomed me to the guest house, which looks exactly as represented except it's even more spacious. This was the perfect location for my visit to a neighborhood I grew up in & returned to in order to document in photographs before a huge demolition & redevelopment begins in the adjacent shopping district. I walked all over Pacific Palisades based from this listing's restful and peaceful location. Julian's internet access is strong, and I was even able to do some work at the backyard table (pictured). Parking on this street is on only one side (which my host kindly pointed out after I had somehow missed the signs), so you may not be able to park right out front, but I could always find parking on the block (I arrived on Monday & left on Friday and only used my car a couple times in between). There is a small refrigerator and a single-cup water boiler to make tea with bags or coffee with Starbucks instant (and an actual Starbucks is only a couple blocks away). The couch is comfortable (I did some computer & legal-pad work there), and so is the bed. For my purposes, this was an excellent place to stay in the Palisades, and there was not a moment I didn't feel comfortable at this listing. ",location
Second stay here--it's a very comfortable and quiet place. Everything we needed.,location
"Our host was fantastic from the first contact -- friendly, welcoming and efficient. He accommodated our request on the key exchange which was greatly appreciated and made it easy. Our visit to L.A. was enhanced by staying in this private, quiet and spacious Pied a Terre situated in the back garden of our host's home in Pacific Palisades, which is a delightful beach town in West L.A. close to hiking, West Hollywood, and Santa Monica. Street parking was easy. The space was exactly as pictured only better, the bed comfortable, lots of room, a clean new bathroom, beautiful wood floors and downtown was an easy 2 minute walk. Coffee bars (including a Starbucks), juice bars, breakfast, lunch, pharmacy and grocery store all at the ready. There is also a lovely garden with an outdoor table and chairs for sitting outside and relaxing; and the best thing is the private entrance. The location is excellent -- right off Sunset, less than a mile to Pacific Coast Hwy. We enjoyed meeting and talking with our hosts and will definitely stay here again! Thanks Julian!",location
Julian's place is a convenient place to visit Santa Monica and Venice beach (by car). The neighborhood is good. The room is spacious and the garden comfortable.,location
"We loved the garden house, it was so nice and quiet.  Julian and his wife gave us great tips about L A.  <br/>The house was nice, light, clean, comfortable and these lovely hosts where very flexible with the hours. We arrived way to early, and we were allowed to leave our lugguage there. Many thanks",location

"I had a very nice stay here! The location was excellent, the room nice, and the hosts were very friendly and accommodating. I happened to come during a cold-spell in LA and when I let Max know the room was cold, he went out of his way to get me set up with a space heater and make sure I was comfortable. Would absolutely stay again!",location
Lovely little place in a great location right by the Venice canals! Room was the perfect size for the two of us and was stocked with everything we would need!,location

Cute place very close to the beach. Very open to sharing their home including food/kitchen area. Enjoyed my stay!,location

"When we arrived the key was immediately (Website hidden by Airbnb) we settled in & got comfortable quickly..Excellent minutes-away location to charming downtown Pacific Palisades & nearby PCH. Quiet, clean, pleasant..our host provided the additional item or 2 we needed. Julian is pleasant & friendly & we felt like we were ""home"". We will come here again when visiting the Palisades.

Everything was great and just as described! Would definitely stay again :),clean
"Julian's place is a great getaway in Pacific Palisades.  If you like your own space at a reasonable cost, I highly recommend it.  Easily accessible to West Hollywood, Santa Monica, Malibu in a relatively quiet neighborhood. Close to local shops and restaurants. ""An ideal getaway in northwest LA""",location
"This is a very nice, private room in a great neighborhood. It is so conveniently located to stores, cafes, public transport and Santa Monica.<br/>Communication with the hosts was super smooth. I would happily stay there again.",location
"This was the perfect solution for our holiday visit to family in Pacific Palisades.  It is close to the shops and services in the village, and saved us a trip from Santa Monica or Malibu.  The studio has its own space in back of Julian's house, and it is a quiet oasis.  Very clean, with good bed and heater, and a lamp bright enough to read by.  A plus is that Julian's collection of art books and his own photography grace the studio.  It felt very welcoming, and there were extra touches like a small coffee maker and a plate of little candy bars. Julian himself is gracious and helpful.  This was our first Airbnb experience, and it was a great introduction...",clean
"Julian and Patsy were very flexible and accomodating with our arrival time. The place is just as described, cozy, and private with its own side entrance. The location is great. Very close to the hiking trails and Temescal Gateway Park, which was lovely, as well as near dining, shopping, and the Santa Monica Pier.",location
"This sweet, private, ultra-quiet spot is perfect.  Location can't be beat:  walk to the village for coffee, restaurants, banks, pharmacy, all kinds of shops.... or to the local park.  Even to the beach, if you want some exercise and have a little time.  Palisades is a key spot to get around to other cool LA locales like Santa Monica, Malibu, Topanga Canyon.... and of course the beach, both Getty Museums, and really anywhere else since you're not too crazy-far from the 405 or 10 freeways.  <br/>The space is perfectly quiet and private and clean.  You feel like a lucky local in your own secluded spot with a cute little yard.  My daughter had enough space to juggle her soccer ball in the grass.  Also the flowered tree you walk under getting to the door was a pleasure.  <br/>Lastly, Julian was really friendly, mellow, easy to communicate with..... really this spot and everything about the experience was a piece of cake.  ",location
"My wife and I stayed at Julian's for three nights on our trip to explore the West side of LA and visit family. The description of the place is accurate and Julian met us at check-in to go over the accommodations and to make sure we were settled. The room was simple, clean and comfortable. The location was perfect for our visits to the two Getty museums, Santa Monica and to visit family. The neighborhood is quite and safe and it was a short walk to the local market and coffee shops. We would stay with Julian again.",clean
"What a wonderful stay.  I loved the private guest house in the quiet and friendly neighbourhood.  Only a minute from the shops and restaurants, and a beautiful walk to the expansive and breathtaking beach area.",location
Julian and his lovely wife made me feel very welcome .. The room was exactly as described private and great location next to some nice restaurants .. Check out pearl dragon .. I'll be hopefully staying next year !!,location
"My name is Emily, daughter of Fe and John who was lucky enough to stay at Julian &Patsy's place for almost two weeks. <br/>Should you seek tranquility and privacy after touring the beautiful city of Los Angeles or after a life changing retreat in Malibu /Pacific Palisades, Julian's guesthouse is a perfect place to be.  In addition to the restaurants, grocery stores and farmers market, the Will Rogers Beach State Park  & the hiking trails of Temescal Canyon are within your reach. I enjoyed many slumber nights and sunny walks in this beautiful neighborhood. Julian and Patsy were marvelous hosts who respected my need for privacy, yet they were there for me when I needed something. Utterly grateful and highly recommended. ",location
"Excellent accommodations for a visit to the Palisades. Very comfortable bed. Interesting books and knickknacks in the room. Garden patio with table and chairs. Quiet, safe location. Walkable to the village. Priced fairly. We would return.",location
"Julian's place was great. Everything was just like the photos. After a long day of sightseeing, we were able to unwind peacefully. It was quiet and comfy. They left us some water and towels. The little town is near by. We were able to get some food with ease. Only call out was that there was no light path to get to the guest room, but they included a small little flash light on the keys to help. Overall, wonderful! ",clean
Julian's little back house is in a great location and is set up for all your needs.,location
Great stay!  Very peaceful and comfortable.  Would certainly stay again!,location
Jullian & his wife are very sweet. The places nice and peaceful. Great location for walking into town and a 5 min drive to the beach and hikes.,location
"Best location in Los Angeles - super close to anything and everything on the East Side.  <br/><br/>The tent was super comfortable and the view and patio are both amazing. <br/><br/>I brought my friend on her first trip to Los Angeles and we both loved everything about the space. <br/><br/>Victoria has thought and everything and is super thorough,  I would definitely stay here again and recommend the space to anyone.  <br/><br/>Parking was a breeze and when we didnât have the car,  taking a Lyft was extremely cheap.

"Wonderful views, hosts and ambiance! 10/10 would do it again! ",location
"A very lovely bohemian experience ! Beautiful roofterrace with stunning views at a good location in Silverlake. Parking is easy , around the corner. If you want a good bohemian experience right in Silverlake, go to Victoria. ",location
Super cool place to stay! Very comfortable and unique. I wish that we had booked to stay for more time. Hopefully we can come stay again sometime!,location
Victoria was a very gracious host. The pictures of the space are beautiful but must be seen in real life. It is such a nice comfortable retreat in a fast paced big city. We paid for the time to stay there but the LA sunset was just priceless. She had superb recommendations that were all within walking distance and definitely made you feel comfortable just to sit and relax as well.  We will be back! Thank you Victoria.,location
"I stayed in the rooftop tent and had a great experience. <br/><br/>As you can tell from the pictures, their entire house is filled with cool funky decor. Views and sunsets are amazing, it's quiet on the roof both in terms of the rest of the house and in terms of surround neighbors and streets (good thing as I'm a light sleeper) But I slept great in the comfy bed and with lots of fresh air. <br/><br/>I regret that I was out late most evenings and didn't get to see more sunsets or connect more with these sweet hosts!",location
"Great stylish space, we checked in late but Victoria accommodated us! The tent is great for a glamping getaway in the heart of busy LA. Amazing view of downtown from the rooftop at night.",location
"As this was our first glamping experience i would say im very surprised about how good it was to come back to a nice and warm bed after spending hours of walking around in Universal Studios. And after driving several hours.<br/>Me and my girlfriend didn't stay for long but the tent is clean and a place you can really sleep well. The shared bathroom was clean and we were shown around in the house and bathroom even though we arrived a bit later than we said. This was a good place to visit and stay, thank you for having us. I would definitely stay here again if i get the chance. <br/><br/>PS: The view from the rooftop is amazing!  ",clean
Victoria is amazing! She was VERY accommodating to us and made it to where we were able to have one of the best nights of our life. Her space is AMAZING I would recommend it to anyone! The vibe is amazing and the energy is overflowing! ,location
"it's been very funny, beatiful and liberating sleep some day on Victoria's terrace! the view is fantastic and the tent has everything you need for a comfortable stay, included heated mattress pads. just a bit inconvenient the restroom downstairs (for who need it overnight), but it's absolutely something that can be overcome because the romantic nights worth everything:) then the house is like a dream, full of interesting images, objects and books. finally thanks to Victoria's tips we spent a beautiful day trekking in the Griffith Park and having a nice pic nic! recommended!",location
The view is great. Too hot to stay in the summer. The tent is really small. The speaker is installed right next to the tent and it gets really noisy when the host is playing music and enjoying her sunset. Bathroom is downstairs and a little far away.,location
"What a unique experience! This was the last stop on our Californian adventure...and what a memorable way to end it! :) <br/><br/>Although there appears to be a lot of rules and regulations as to what you can / can't do, this was really in order to ensure that our stay was of a high standard. The view really is something else, and for a city full of cars & noise, this roof top retreat was the perfect antidote. Mark's local recommendation was fabulous too. Thanks guys!<br/>",location
"Victoria was an absolute sweetheart! She welcomed me with open arms and was arguable the most friendly AirBNB host Iâve ever dealt with! She has an amazing home in lieu with an amazing view of the city! If you love seeing beautiful sunsets and mellow vibes, this is the place for you!",location
"We had a pleasant stay at Victoria's & Vic's place. The neighborhood is phenomenal and relatively close to everything by using either buses or ride-sharing services. It might be a bit tricky to find the house but Victoria sent detailed instructions making it easier.<br/><br/>While the tent on the patio is equipped with everything to sleep, it requires to do a few backs and forth to the house to take a shower, go the restroom or get some water. The tent is comfortable and offers a beautiful view of the city. ",location
"Victoria was a super nice host! Very responsive :) Thanks for this stay, awesome location, just a little noisy in the morning but amazing view ! You really feel like a local ",location
"Great place! Was worried about the noise but you're so high up the hills that you don't really hear much of any. Great views of the city's sky scrapers and the Hollywood sign to the right. Split between me and my boyfriend, it came out to be about $50 per night for each of us which is a hell of a deal. The bathroom is shared and you will have to go through the house and encounter people to use it but the hosts are great about respecting your privacy and space. Thanks for the great stay!",location
my dream came true! I finally found my home away from home :) ,location
"Really beautiful and eclectic place, I stayed in the tent on the roof- the views are great. Victoria was very friendly and gave me some great tips as to what to see and where to eat during my stay. Would definitely recommend, thank you!",location
"We had a really unique and awesome experience staying at Victoria and Markâs terrace tent!  The terrace has the most beautiful view, and the tent itself is so cool inside with a dÃ©cor that really transports you to a different place.  The tent includes many things to make the stay as comfortable as possible: mattress heating, a decorative space heater, additional blankets and pillows, numerous outlets, a waste bin, mosquito screen, etc etc.  Although the rules and guidelines seemed a little overwhelming in text, once we actually arrived and got the walkthrough from Victoria and Mark it was all clear and pretty reasonable.  The only thing that was a little unclear to me beforehand was that there might be other renters occupying another area of their home.  So youâll likely be sharing the bathroom space with another guest, who also is allowed access to the terrace til 10pm (which wasnât a problem for us though).  Victoria and Mark themselves were chill and very interesting peopleâ definitely visit with them if you get the opportunity!  Overall we had a really memorable stay, thank you!",location
Victoria and her husband were phenomenal hosts. They provided great tips on local sights and also was very quick to rwspond to any messages prior to arriving. We left a necklace and jewelry and not only did they fimd it for us but they also mailed it to us the next day. Such great people.,host
Right on the canals and close to the beach. Parking wasn't too bad. Friendly cats,location
"Exactly as the photos and description suggests, youâre getting a small bedroom in shared living space in an amazing location. The hosts were great, allowing us a later check in with our flight, as well as a place to keep our baggage after check out. Close to everything in Venice as well as walking distance to Santa Monica.",location
"What a unique experience! The heated mattress, piles of blankets and endless pillows made this tent the coziest place I've slept in a long time. The view from the deck is not to be missed. I would definitely stay here again!",location
Great location! Amazing views of LA from the deck! Perfect place for your down to earth solo traveler.  <br/>Only complaints is the mattress bed & pillows should be improved. I woke up with back pain from it.,location
One of the best bnb's I've ever stayed at! Pictures do not do it justice!,location
"Beautiful tent! Very zen! After staying in Victoriaâs home, my soul feels refreshed! Will be coming back!",location
its really cosy with a great view.,location

"The view is amazing. This is a great spot for the sunset and you can see the Hollywood sign in the distance. Sunset Boulevard is walking distance away and there's plently to see within a quick drive. Victoria was very friendly and welcoming, and was helpful with offering suggestions of places to visit. The only part we found a little annoying was having to go downstairs and through the house to use the bathroom, but I think the view makes up for it.",location
Only one night but such a good one :)<br/>Really good place to stay !!!,location
"GREAT place. I absolutely recommend the âtentâ. The view is fantastic, the decor is beautiful, and no need to worry about cold nights as the bed is heated. ð¤  Victoria is very helpful when it comes to tips on getting around and recommending spots to eat/see.",location
"Stunning view, convenient location and a well-managed place. Would recommend.",location
"Glamping, as described. Quirky home and private outdoor/indoor hut on deck. Plenty warm even in late December. It was a bit of a hassle to go to the bathroom, but that's the only downside.",location
"I just had one of the greatest nights of my life with my girlfriend at Victoria's place. For Victoria, hosting guests at this beautiful setting and welcoming them to their wonderland is rather more important and enjoyable than being a host to make money. I really loved how she was super excited about our stay and comfort. I totally recommend this place, worthwhile airbnb experience for a romantic night! Thank you Victoria",location
This is such a beautiful place. Very unique and highly recommend. Amazing views very private area.<br/>We absolutely loved it.,location

It was clean and comfortable - but be sure to pack a couple bath towels and travel iron! The location is within walking distance to cute brunch places, and the farmer's market at the local school was a nice way to spend a morning. Street parking was not a problem either.

Julian's cottage is a quiet retreat with a lovely little garden to hang out in. It was the perfect getaway for a weekend filled with parties and socializing. The pictures make the room look dark but with the blinds open it's quite bright and airy. The only thing we missed was a TV.,location
"Julian's place was lovely! Beautiful, upscale area with great access to Santa Monica. It surprised me with an exceptionally comfortable bed and a Herman Miller office chair, which was really nice because I needed to do some work during my trip. Do be aware that the sofa is not appropriate for sleeping for anyone larger than a small child, so if you have multiple people in your group they will need to be comfortable sharing the (very nice) queen bed.",location

The Pacific Coast Highway is a short drive, so it is straightforward to get most places in LA. Julian is responds quickly if needed and is hospitable.",location
"This is a very comfortable accommodation which is in easy walking of the village.  The room and shower are very clean and the bed comfortably firm. Excellent for a single or a couple. No kitchen, just a refrigerator and a coffee maker but, with the coffee shops and restaurants so close by, this is not an issue. The hosts are very nice and accommodating. If you are without a car there is the number 2 bus that runs along the blvd to downtown Los Angeles.",clean

"Victoria's place is SO COOL and the surrounding area is breathtaking. We stayed in the tent, which has a beautiful view overlooking the city and is nicely tucked out of site from the street. The tent was decorated with fabulous fabrics and pillows, and was perfectly cozy with a space heater on a chilly night. In order to go to the bathroom, you need to go into the main house, which is also fabulous and is a no-shoe zone, so bring something easy to slip on and off your feet.",location
"Good location and unique place to stay.  Cool view off the deck.  Shared bathroom made me feel like I was intruding a little bit when I had to use bathroom at night before going to bed, but the hosts seemed use to it so didn't seem to be a problem.  If you are looking for something different and a place to sleep this is it.",location
"Had a beautiful two nights staying with Victoria! The space was breathtaking in its view, overlooking the skyline of LA and it was nice and quaint. The touches to ensure it was cozy, like the heater and fan were real handy and nice to have. Did get some mosquito bites so donât forget to use the repellent Victoria provides!",location
"The location of this Airbnb is beautiful and the glam-ping was fun but we really couldnât enjoy it much because we just couldnât wait to leave. This was due to an awkward check in and the whole Airbnb situation being such an OCD thing for the hosts. It made us feel like we were annoying the hosts. I completely respect hosts wanting their stuff kept up and clean, however, they were a little over the top about the whole situation. It just wasnât relaxing like I thought itâd be. I was just disappointed because the hosts were not very welcoming and it made our stay very awkward. I love interacting with welcoming hosts and having cool conversations but this stay was not like that. Most likely the hosts were thrown off because they werenât aware of our staying, even though I had booked two weeks in advance and had communicated our arrival as requested and someone had checked in out of no where apparently. Anyway, long story short-ish, really really read their long advertisement before you reserve and take it word for word. This extensive of an advertisement should have told me to pick another place but I thought it was just precautionary against bad Airbnb-ers. It wasnât, the hosts are just really particular so if youâre okay with this and it doesnât make you uncomfortable or nervous, youâll love the Airbnb.",location
"This place is awesome!! The tent is warm and cozy, and the roof has an absolutely incredible view. You have lot of privacy on the roof, you just have to go downstairs into the house to use the bathroom. The place is in a great location, and Victoria is super nice. Highly recommend!",location
Beautiful Space & Amazing Vibes,location
"We enjoyed our stay in this quirky, yet completely comfortable location. The space is very stylish, but also very clean and neat. Both Victoria and Mark were hospitable and flexible and we so appreciate them! <br/><br/>Thanks again! :)",clean
"Gorgeous place, especially the view from the balcony. Sparkling clean as reported and overall comfortable.",clean
Beautiful Tent and Gorgeous views.,location
Great location with a beautiful view. Good place to crash if youâre going to be out and busy doing stuff in LA.,location
The stay was amazing. Victoria and Mark were fantastic hosts and the space was clean and was just as advertised.,clean
Beautiful space! Amazing view to wake up to,location
"Fantastic place in a great location. The tent is super comfortable and has awesome views, while Victoria and Mark have a bunch of great suggestions on where to go.",location
Amazing location and great view of the city,location
Super friendly host & nice set up! Amazing views on the deck as well.,location
"A fun experience for a night or two.  The rooftop view was special and unique.  Tent cozy and comfy.  Do note that this is not a place to stay if you are wrangling alot of luggage.  It is down on steep flight if brick stairs to access the house, then up wooden stairs to the roof.",location
"Beautiful place with a beautiful view. Pretty close to downtown, Sunset Blvd, and Hollywood. Victoria and her husband gave me a tour of the place, lovely people. Parking was easy to find and didn't have to walk much to get to her place. Though the tent was a fun experience with a great view, I wasn't expecting to walk up and down so many flight of stairs just to go to the bathroom. Keep in mind that you're sleeping outside so you hear everything and anything and ear plugs are a must if you're a light sleeper. The bed was comfortable and they have accommodations in the tent if you're cold or hot. Great location, a bit of an inconvenience for me, but overall a fun experience.",location
Everything went well.  Area is nice. View is great.  For being a tent it was very comfy and we got some nice rest.  Would recommend earplugs if you're a light sleeper cause there is more ambient noise than a house coming from street and occasional helicopter that passes by.  But apart from that very cozy.  Shared bathroom and access to house is a little tedious cause you have to walk downstairs and take off your shoes and go into the house.  Hosts are polite.,location
Wonderful experience thank you for letting us stay !,location
Amazing Airbnb. Would 100 percent come back,clean
Victoria was very sweet and friendly and had a wonderful home. The view from my stay was spectacular and I really enjoyed the outdoor feel of the space!,location
This place was so beautiful! We stayed for one night and really enjoyed the tent and upstairs deck. Victoria was very quick in responding and helpful. Amazing little getaway!,location
"This place is so fun, a bit wild, beatiful tent, cozy, with a great view of the city!",location
A truly stunning view with deck chairs right outside the front of your tent. A bit of a trek to the shared bathroom or kitchen. Very easy to stay here. We booked day-of and had no issues. Expect more of a glamping than house experience.,location
"Absolutely incredible stay with countless amenities and breath-taking city view from the porch, such a unique stay!",location
This was a great place to stay and as-advertised.,clean
Great views.  Very cool space.  Very warm inside the tent even in the winter.  Victoria is really cool and nice.  Would definitely come back.,location
"If youâre having second thoughts about Victoriaâs place Iâm here to tell you BOOK IT NOW!<br/><br/>We visited in a cold weekend and even if it was freezing outside, the tent was super warm with a heater and electric blankets.<br/><br/>The from the balcony where the tent is is incredible, whether itâs day or night.<br/><br/>If youâre worried about parking, itâs quite easy to find it around the street where Victoria told us.<br/><br/>Going to the restroom may seem to a hassle to some since you have to walk down from the balcony and into the house but honestly it wasnât a bother to us.<br/><br/>The bathroom has a basket for your own lil hand towels and to place your toothbrushes. It also has a heatlamp so you can stay warm while you get in and out the shower.<br/><br/>Overall great experience, canât wait to return!!",location
This place is absolutely fantastic. Even with it being a bit chilly outside the tent stayed nice and cozy. Heated bed and a little space heater kept me comfy all night. And the view! Very special little spot. Cannot recommend it highly enough! All the stars! Victoria is a great host and very accommodating. Would absolutely stay there again.,location
Itâs so nice to stay at Victoriaâs place. The tent is warm and decorated well. Looking forward to come back in the future. Thanks,location
"If youâre looking for a fun and relaxing place to stay in LA, come stay at Victoriaâs. My favorite part is waking up to the sound of the city right outside of my room :)",location
Staying in the rooftop tent was a wonderful experience! My husband and I had a great time and really enjoyed the beautiful view out over Los Angeles. This is a glamping experience and highly recommend this to anyone wanting a unique experience :),location
"Living up to its namesake, the Scheherazade rooftop offered ever more comfort and enchantment with each passing night. Perfectly suited to my needs, I would stay again. Thanks Victoria.",location
"The listing is very accurate, including the various rules and the hostâs detailed policies on checking in/out and communication. The deck has a lovely view and the tent was very cozy.",location
"I arrived at this space beginning of February. First night was miserable. It was sooo windy. That tint was swaying back and forth, making noise, and I could hardly sleep. The view is amazing of the city, however, it's not enjoyable if its loud. It was not loud from the street, but when the tint is making ""wind"" noises and rocking you can't relax.  The host was kind enough to let me sleep in the house instead. The room inside is awesome!!! Beautiful corner room view and very spacious. I would book this and skip the tint. The host woman is rude in my opinion. She asked me to bring down sheets from tint, so I did. I brought in the blankets and sheets and she smirked and said with a tone ""I just told you to bring down sheets. Did you not listen?"" Overall, there's better places to stay with friendlier people, but this was cheap so can't complain.",location
Captivating!,location
"Awesome view when you wake up in the morning and have a coffee on the balcony, love this place.",location
"AMAZING view and cozy glamping setup. The listing is very accurate to the experience, which is nice. Would definitely recommend, especially if you are looking for an experience in your sleeping arrangements while doing your own thing in LA.",location

Amazing! Has a beautiful view and you can see the hollywood sign clearly from the patio. Great host with breakfast included!,location
"Perfect location and view for my first visit to California! The space was comfortable and beautiful, especially the deck right outside the tent that showed a fantastic view of the city. Location was great for close places to eat/drink and public transportation, and even with the hills it was a convenient spot for someone who likes to walk and explore. Victoria was very communicative about the space and arrival!",location
Victoria's place is great! the tent is well sealed and comfortable. The Jacuzzi as a treat! The view from the balcony is spectacular. The place was clean and comfortable. And the communication with Victoria was fluent. We'll be happy to book again!,location
Victoria lives in amazing Silver Lake neighborhood. The views are unbelievable and the vibe is great!,location

"Julianâs place is in a great area. So close to the beach. And itâs quiet. You donât feel close to downtown Santa Barbra at all!  Only downside is there is no microwave, just a small fridge. Plan on eating out for all your meals.",location
"Five star place. Apartment is big, clean, private and comfortable. Julian is a great host. Beautiful neighbourhood and the property is a two-minute walk from a Ralphâs, a great Italian restaurant and an incredible sushi restaurant- Pearl Dragon.",clean
We had a wonderful stay at Julian and Patsy's. It was clean and Julian was a great host! There were nice touches like spare floss and some tea/coffee that really made it feel like a cozy home. The location is also convenient when visiting LA. I would recommend it for anyone visiting.,clean
Clean and comfortable,clean

Always enjoy staying here.,location
Perfect stay! Great location. Excellent hosts.,location
"Sweet, classy, low-key, quiet. Street parking was an initial worry but turned out to be a breeze. Their place is two blocks from all kinds of store-goodness on Sunset. A restful, welcoming space I'll come back to again.",location
"Everything was ""as advertised"". Despite no kitchen, it was a great little spot with nice cafes in walking distance so we were never at a loss. And no problems finding parking spaces for my rental car on the side streets. We received delicious apples for breakfast one morning from Patsy and it was one of the little touches that made the whole experience worth it. Highly recommended.",location
"Great place.  Great location. Great hosts. Street parking can require walking up to a block at certain times of the day, but the nice place and the proximity to good restaurants and other village conveniences more than makes up for it.  All in all, it was a very good experience.",location
"We had a great time at Julian and Patsy's. It was quiet, the bed was comfortable, everything was very clean and they even left us a note with a little gift for our anniversary which was so thoughtful! It's very conveniently located (very short walking distance to the town) and easy to get places on nearby Sunset by car. Only note, like people have said before, parking wasn't super difficult but also not 100% convenient (have to drive around looking for parking and park up to a block away at times). Overall, great stay!",clean
Great spot. I would stay again! ,location
"Cute & cozy space. Perfect for 2 people. Super clean! Very close to town so can walk to get coffee, food, etc. liked the small touches like the chocolate & water they left for us. ",clean
"A cosy, quiet backyard guest cottage in the middle of Pacific Palisades. They provide everything from a great bed to clothes iron to shampoo -- they even left chocolates and water. No AC, but you really don't need it as you're quite near to the sea. Can't recommend enough and would absolutely stay again.",location
"Exactly what we expected, hosts were very easy-going and kind. The room was perfect for the price and the location was more than perfect, a very short walk to the beach!!! We had a wonderful stay here, thank you!!",location
"My boyfriend and I stayed with Max and Jenny for the weekend after a busy trip to Disney. It was just lovely! The location to the beach for the price is unbeatable. The bed is super comfy and the apartment is very cute and quaint. The hosts provided everything we could possibly need for a comfortable stay and we wished we could stay longer. They are super friendly and so are their adorable cats! If we come to Venice again, we would definitely stay here. Thank you Max and Jenny!",location
Perfect place to feel at home. Very comfortable bed and room in general. Two beautiful cats and breakfast was on offer every morning. About 5 minutes walk to the beach. Would definitely stay again!,location
"The location could not be better just a 2min walks to the beach and Venice canals! We could easily park the car in the street for free and tons of parking around for a good price. Max is super easy, he waited for us and it was very easy to plan our arrival. Also, we enjoyed Willie's and Little Girl's (the 2 cutest cats) company. Great place to stay at in Venice area.",location
I really enjoyed my stay. Quiet cozy place to rest up. Super close to the beach. Also may be the comfiest bed I ever slept on. Highly recommend staying here.,location
Great location and comfy bed,location
"The hosts were so kind and the communication was great. I forgot my keys inside the room and had to ask them to open the front door,mind you it was about 11:30pm, and they so kindly opened the door without hesitation. (Some other AiRbnb Iâve stayed at had ride hosts of something went wrong so this was a big deal to me). As for the room, it was so quirky and personal-felt like home away from home. And the cats were SO CUTE & friendly. Great home,great people, great location.",location
"The hosts were very welcoming and really fun to talk to. They described the place as ""tiny"" but it was perfectly spacious and had a very nice atmosphere. They provided us with breakfast food and filtered water as well as beach towels! The location was incredible, just 30 seconds from Venice boardwalk, the beach and the canals were directly behind the house. We also really enjoyed the company of the two very cute cats even though Little Girl was a little menace during the night.",location
Max's place was perfect for my boyfriend and I's quick visit to LA. The apartment was incredibly charming and welcoming (including their two cats). Extremely convenient location near all the attractions Venice has to offer. We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if given the chance!,location
The stay was even better than expected - great hosts in a perfect location with great value!,location
"The hosts were great at communication and made us feel at home. They have two very sweet cats that will be your new best friends. The house is just a few minutes walk from Venice Beach and right by the Venice Canals. Thereâs tons of restaurants and shopping within walking distance as well. The listing accurately describes the property. It is an older house and right by the beach so there is some noise pollution but it quieted down at night and we had no issues sleeping. The bed is super comfortable and the hosts went out of the way to make sure the room was stocked with towels and other travel necessities guests may have forgotten to pack. Overall, it was a perfect fit for our weekend getaway in Venice!",location
"We had a wonderful time at Maxâs place. The location is perfect, the bed is really comfy and the two cats are the cutest ! I can only recommend !!!",location
A good place for a short stay to do Venice Beach but if you want the rest of LA it is a bit tough without a car.,location
Perfect location and awesome kitties,location
Good location if you want to be near Venice Beach! Small but cozy- has everything you need :),location
"The place is great, the room is big and cozy with a great window. The cats are such sweeties!",location
"They went above and beyond to make me feel welcome, have what I needed, know what to expect and know what I could enjoy in the area. You feel right at home with them and if you linger and chat, theyâre engaging conversationalists! I have fond memories! If I was a local weâd be friends!",clean
"The room is very cozy and lovely. The apartment is like a 5 minute walk away from the beach and has the perfect location. <br/>Max and Jennie provide breakfast, essentials for cooking, shampoo,... which is great! <br/>They also have two cute cats that love to be cuddled and get attention ;) <br/>We had a great time!",location
"Amazing hosts, amazing location and amazing kitties. Highly recommend booking Peter and Jenny - they made my girlfriend and I feel right at home!",location
"If Pacific Palisades is in your plans, Julian and Patsy's cottage is the purr-fect space. Detached,  private, with access to a backyard, walk to shops, banks and great restaurants, all in walking distance. Have a blast!",location
"Cozy, clean amenities. Within walking distance to hiking trails and a quick drive/taxi/bus ride to the beach. Right next to the Main Street of Pacific Palisades with many cafes, restaurants and grocery stores.",location
Everything was great :) Peaceful appartment and the neighbourhood was nice.,location
Great place. Great people,location
Julian and Patsy's home was lovely and a great location! Loved the smell of the mint in the backyard and the close proximity to the village.,location
"Patsy met us in the front and gave us a lot of recommendations on things to do. The place is at a quite neighborhood close to restaurant and grocery store but is also convenient for going to the beach. <br/><br/>The room is very clean and nicely decorated. We both adored their bookcase with a wide collection of books, just what you would need for a relaxing get-away. Will definitely stay agin if Iâm in the area.",clean
"We had a wonderful stay at Julian and Patsyâs comfortable and welcoming place.  We especially loved the location in the beautiful residential neighborhood of Pacific Palisades.  Itâs an enjoyable one-mile walk from an overlook of the ocean and just a couple of blocks from good restaurants.  For most of our visit we didnât have a car and found it easy to get around either by walking or by using  the number 9 bus, which goes to Santa Monica.  We highly recommend Julian and Patsyâs place.",location
Great place to stay. Thanks.,location
"Great place to stay for a night, but not long-term. Priced appropriately.",location
"Clean, comfortable and well located. I would totally stay there again!",clean
A nice place to stay if you want to be close to Venice! Two friendly cats that like to cuddle. We had a nice time.,location
"For a short trip in San Francisco this house is perfect, with Uber you can reach the center in 30min, but itâs really close to the airport. The room is clean, lots of towels, and everything you need. The host is really available, everytime.",clean
"Itâs like stepping into the core of Venice, cats are absolutely great and had a smooch with both, Max was accommodating and understanding about my super late arrival. <br/><br/>Plus, this place is literally a stone throw away from the boardwalk. <br/><br/>Will definitely stay again :)",location
The room is little but I was alone so it was fine! The bed is very comfortable and the cats are adorable. I suggest it for few days.,clean
House location is perfect. The cats really made it for us. They are so cute and cuddly.,location

No surprise when you arrive. Location is great to Venice Beach and Santa Monica. House really fit with the description<br/>And the two cat of the house are so nice,location
Very good to stay near Venice beach in walkable distance. Max is very welcoming and supportive when we got late for check-in becoz of personal issues. House is very clean and perfect for 2.,location
Great place. Great area. Great hosts!,location
"Cozy, place that is very close to the beach to have a nice get away.",location
"Max was a great host! The description was extremely accurate and they were super accommodating and flexible w check in time. The only one thing to call out is - as mentioned in the Airbnb description- there are 2 cats who roam freely. The cats do come into the room frequently and are hard to move out. We had to be smart about closing the room door immediately after entering. Again- the cats were called out in the description, but just be aware that they may spend a lot of time in your room!",clean
Really nice place to stay in Venice Beach - perfect location and nice hosts. Absolutely recommendable!,location
Clean room with very friendly cats.,clean
"Amazing location, extremely comfortable bed, very quiet, clean and wonderful cuddly cats! We had a great stay at Maxâs place! Would definitely recommend",clean
"Great location in front of Venice beach. Cute cats. Thank you so much for being flexible with my check-in time. I had to change the check-in time a few times and in the end, I was still late because of the difficulties to find a parking lot. For anyone checking in with a car, I recommend being cautious and plan ahead on how you will find a parking.",location
We had a great stay here. The location is ideal being so close to the beach. The room itself was cozy and clean with a great selection of books and art. We got to Venice by biking from LA and the hosts were incredibly accomodating and helped us store the bikes overnight.,clean
The description is correct. The toilet/bathroom is very tight but no issues. The room itself  has a lot of personal stuff in it and we felt a bit weird about staying there.,clean
Small house but worse the price,price
Thank you so much for a warm stay. We enjoyed being a part of Venice area for a couple of days with great hosts. Extra thanks for little nice things like flowers and home bread. Definitely will recommend anyone whoâs visiting LA.,location
"It was very centrally located! Loved having the beach one way, Abbott-Kinney and Erewhon market in the other direction. The space was great for sleeping; very cozy bed. The hosts allowed us to check-in late with no problem.. we really appreciated that! It is a bit noisy, but if you want to be close to everything- that is to be expected!",location
"If you love a place that feels like home, this oneâs for you. Great conversation, awesome cats, and just enough creak in the stairs to have that home feel you miss when traveling.",location

Great location and living space,location
"Though we did not get to meet them, Max and Jenny were great hosts. They made everything clear for us. Their home was cosy and creatively decorated, as well as in a great location. It is beautiful to walk around the canals and is super close to Venice Beach. And their two cats are the sweetest!",location
Perfect location for Venice beach,location
Perfect place to stay next to Venice canals. Just 5 mins walk to the beach with lots of food choices around. Also very accessible with public transport going to Santa Monica Pier and Downtown LA. The hosts are very busy people and are usually not around but I was able to have a small chat with Max before we left and he seems to be a cool and kind guy. The room itself is very comfortable with lots of books and personal artworks which makes it homey. And the two cats roaming around are so cute too! :-),location
"The location of Maxâs place is amazing, right down the block from Venice beach. The room was super clean and had a great book collection! Definitely was a great stay!",clean
Loved our stay here. Convenient location for the beach and the room was very nice. When you open all the windows you can almost imagine its a tree house!,location

"Felt like home, sharing D's apartment.  Easy going, eager to help in any way, and, given her busy schedule, the place--cozy, comfy and full of light--is largely yours.  Location great too: just a five minute walk to the beach, less than that to Abbot Kinney for shopping/dining, and the famous Venice canals are even closer.  Cute fun kitty to play with too!",location

"Very cozy little backyard studio in a lovely neighborhood. Parking was available and easy. Hosts were nice, although we had very minimal interaction with them. Very sweet birthday greeting, fresh flowers, water bottles and chocolate upon arrival. Bed was comfy. The accommodations were simple and adequate. Very close to the Getty museums, Santa Monica, Venice and Malibu beaches. A good value in a great location. Recommended.",location
"This was exactly what we needed in every way for a short weekend visit to Pacific Palisades for a wedding. The location was perfect (we could walk to all of our events!), the check-in process simple, and the room itself was comfortable, private, clean, and welcoming.

Julian and Patsyâs place was perfect location to get to all places in LA and was easy to access. Parking is super easy as well.  ,location
Quiet. Clean. Comfortable. I have stayed here multiple times and each time it feels like home. It's such a great little space in the Palisades. Highly recommend.,clean

"My husband and I stayed here 4 years ago and knew exactly where we wanted to stay when we came back. For us, the location is the most important and this is located right near sunset Blvd with lots of great shops and restaurants. It was raining during our stay this time, which was a slight bummer because we werenât able to walk down to the shops, but we had a rental car and the close drive to Santa Monica beach, Malibu, & everything else is just so great. We went to Will Rogers State Historic Park (awesome exercise & views) and hiked there and the drive is literally only 2-3 mins from this guesthouse. We love the Pacific Palisades area and this airbnb really is such an awesome value for how centrally located we can be for all of the places we like to visit while in LA!",location
"clean, comfortable, easy access, parking availability, quick responses! Thank you!",clean
"Wonderful room tucked in the Palisades. It is a separate building behind the house, so very private. Close to everything you might need. 7 min from the beach and 5 min from the hiking trails in the canyon. Patsy and Julian are great hosts, very attentive.",location
A very attractive and comfortable studio apartment in a very nice neighborhood. I had everything I needed and my few communications were answered quickly. It's a short walk to shops and espresso. The garden is pleasant and the little pied a terre is very private. I would stay here again.,location
"Our stay was so great. The location is perfect. A really nice quiet residential neighborhood but only a short ride or leisurely walk to silver lake or echo park neighborhoods which are amazing for restaurants, bars and anything else. The spot was nice and clean and the view is absurdly nice. The bed is super comfy and cozy. Great stay would definitely do it again",location

"Victoria's place was a very special experience that I recommend for people looking for something nice, wholesome and just really different in all the right ways. We had a wonderful time enjoying the views while having everything else we need for a great and relaxing time. Highly recommended!!!",location
"I really enjoyed my stay at Victoria's place! The view from the deck is beautiful and it faces west so you can enjoy the sunset. Everything was reasonably clean especially given it's a semi-outdoor stay. The bed is very comfortable and I wasn't too cold even in February - the space heater and heated blankets help a lot. And, the bath is wonderful! There is some space in the kitchen and bathroom where you can store things (like toiletries, etc) that you might not want to keep in the tent. <br/><br/>One thing I want to note because it can be confusing looking at previous reviews - the tent now has a hard covering which was added recently (Victoria let me know that she was adding it after I booked my stay, which was much appreciated since I was a little nervous about staying in a tent during California's rainy season). It didn't end up raining while I was there, but I'm confident that it wouldn't have been an issue. The hard roof over the tent seemed extremely waterproof.",location
"Great place, great view, great host. The neighborhood was quite and a nice break away from DTLA. Everything was set up and worked just as noted by host in descriptions.",location
"Great Even in Inclement Weather!<br/><br/>I stayed at Victoria's place during an unusual LA weekend in which it both rained and dipped into the low 40s at night. The tent has a hard top that stayed dry and the space heater and heating blankets kept it warm. <br/><br/>Besides the tent, the view is phenomenal, the jacuzzi tub is super, and Victoria's is located near some incredible restaurants off of Silver Lake Blvd and Sunset Blvd.",location
This was a beautiful little getaway spot! Will definitely be back.,location
"Things I look for in my AirBNB:<br/>Location: check<br/>Cleanliness:check<br/>Comfy bed: double check<br/>Great shower: check (note: jacuzzi w shower head)<br/>Communication: check<br/>Special sauce: check (tent!)<br/>This is a bit of a different stay in that it is a tent but it was comfortable,  clean and fun! <br/>Iâd stay Againð",clean
Unique and beautiful spot in a gorgeous neighborhood! The huge terrace has stunning views - this along made the stay worth it. Easy walking distance to great restaurants and things to do in Silver Lake and Echo Park. We visited in late March and were plenty warm in the tent. Would definitely come back!,location
Great views and close enough to a bunch of stuff in the area! Highly recommended if you want to visit LA and not been in the thick of the it all. There was a lot to do in the silverlake area!,location
"Amazing location, stunning view. So happy we decided to stay here a few nights. One of the best decisions we made for our LA trip",location
Superhosts! <br/><br/>They were so awesome and communicative. Everything was just great!<br/><br/>The area is awesome with plenty to do.<br/>I highly recommend checking out the area.,location
"If you have an open heart and  mind this place can be magical. There is nothing like sleeping in a tent on a rooftop in LA. The view was unbelievable, the breeze lovely and the temperature perfect with the heater. Itâs a little weird to not have much indoor space but well worth it to have the insanely good outdoor space.",location
"We loved our stay here. Part of the charm is the lively, dense Silver Lake community that is all around you--but expect noise at night in this wonderful location.",location
Perfect place and location.  View day and night.  All the little things thought of and offered to make your stay comfortable and private.,location
This is a little hidden oasis for out of country or state travellers and I'd bet it would be a nice little weekend getaway for those who live in town too. We had a lovely and peaceful stay while in town and would stay here again without question. The accommodations are clean and the decorations are peaceful and calming. The view is beautiful and we found ourselves waking to see the city light up in the mornings and we ate in to watch the sunset. One of the nights got chilly but the heated blankets were absolutely perfect. Thank you for a memorable trip!,location
"I loved staying at Victoriaâs place. The experience was unique, comfortable, and generally perfect. Victoria is a great, thoughtful host with great energy. Iâd absolutely stay there again the next time I visit.",location
"Great location and neighborhood , I felt very safe walking to get food as a solo female traveler. The stay was beautiful and comfortable. You can even see the Hollywood letters from the deck!",location
A great and comfortable place to stay.  Perfect location with beautiful views from the deck.  Very nicely decorated as well.,location
"I thoroughly enjoyed staying here, although I only recommend it if you donât mind being exposed to the elements, as you are in a tent. But a few bug bites and cold night air didnât detract from waking up to sunlight showing through the roof, the spectacular view, and the glut of deck space to practice yoga or relax in. I will say, my stuff felt a little insecure just being left in a tent that the family or anyone in their house has access to, so I started locking my stuff in the bathroom/kitchen space. Victoria was very kind and accommodating, and a great communicator.",location
It was an oasis!  We were in town on business and the space was just what we hoped for.  Uniquely designed and super comfy.  We sat on the roof top deck and worked in the LA sun shine. Felt like a mini-vaca! Weâll be back!,location
What a treat to stay on Victoriaâs gorgeous and interesting property in the hills of Silver Lake. The location could not be more ideal for easy access to all the delicious food and drinks and venues on Sunset and Silver Lake Boulevard. We barely used our car which is such a lovely surprise for LA! The tent and bathhouse are extremely comfortable and we reveled in the absolutely incredible views from the deck. What a steal and dream for the area! Donât pass up this spot.,location
"Comfy tent, great views, and well-equipped bath house/kitchen.",location
"Fun, non-traditional place to stay in LA (which is what I was looking for). Clean, comfortable, convenient, easy check in, great views, fun hosts, safe, great Silver Lake neighborhood. Thanks Victoria!",location
Victoria was communicative from the start and made effort to make my stay welcoming. A beautiful space with an amazing view hosted by lovely people ðð¼,location
Exquisite view of Hollywood Sign as well as DTLA. Very cool indoor/outdoor space that feels between a jacuzzi suite and boho-glamping. KILLER location with easy access to everything. HIGHLY recommend.,location
"Victoria is a fast communicator and was very accommodating to our requests. Safe location, clean space, and beautiful view from the deck!",location
Diana is the best! She made me feel at home the first day I got there. I never felt like I had to be in my room. I had everything I could have possibly needed! ,clean
"Anna's place was lovely - very tastefully furnished, fantastic location, with all the amenities you could think of and then some. The outdoor shower was handy to wash off sand from the beach but also very cutely surrounded by greenery, making it pleasant for a random outdoor shower when the weather was hot. The large doors from the living and bed room to the patio let in the refreshing ocean breeze and the high living room ceiling and open concept gave a very spacious feel. This place worked out very well for us with 2 small children (1 and 2.5 yrs old)  and 3 adults - Anna stacked a couple extra twin mattresses to make a temporary additional bed in the dining room, which worked out comfortably.",location
Location couldnt be better. Place had a king bed so that was good. No couch or tv. Pretty uncomfortable to stay for long periods of time. If you have funishings to bring with you great 10/10,location
"Amazing place with beautiful garden,perfect for two people with great hospitality.We were late about an hour but they were there and waiting for us, for which I want to say one more time thank you Julian for that.<br/>Also anything that you'll need you can find it in 5 min. distance.The neighborhood fantastic with very good restaurants and market places .<br/>Cafe Vida just 5 min. from the house for the best breakfast ever. Enjoy!!",location
Easy and excellent stay! Would absolutely stay here again. Perfect location for access to the beach and Hollywood.,location
"The Spacious Garden Pied a Terre is perfect for a great stay in Pacific Palisades. It was comfortable, cozy and a great location! Wish I had more time to enjoy the nice garden and see more of the local spots and nearby beach areas. Perfect!",location
Great location for exploring LA while enjoying a quite place. Also within 5min drive of the beach.,location
Wonderful location and excellent hosts. Easy check-in and check-out and just a great space for what I needed. Loved that they didnât have a TV in the space.,location
Wonderful location! Everything you need. A beautiful garden area to enjoy.,location

Great place to stay in LA! Lots of trails nearby and close to the beach.,location
"What a lovely spot! Julian and Patsyâs place is clean, quiet and peaceful. Super-comfy bed and nice, new bathroom. The location canât be beat - a short walk to downtown Pacific Palisades with all sorts of restaurants, coffee shops, etc. AND walking distance to Temescal Canyon Park, one of the best hiking spots in LA. Julian and Patsy were communicative and helpful. Highly recommended!",location
"I was here for a work trip and Julian and Patsy's was perfect! I imagine it would also be great for a vacation! One block walk to the new and awesome Palisades Village and tons of other shops and restaurants makes it perfect if you don't want to rent a car. Walking distance to an awesome hike at Temescal Canyon. The place was super clean and had everything I needed. Since I was there for work I didn't need a kitchen, but the mini-fridge and kettle (plus provided instant coffee and tea) were everything I needed. Two groceries stores in walking distance as well if you want snacks or breakfast. Super comfy bed! Quiet neighborhood which was great for me and my jet lag :)",clean
Great location close to the fashionable little shopping area of Pacific Palisades yet very peaceful and secluded. Highly highly recommended! Perfect location for visiting LAâs west side.,location
The host canceled this reservation 14 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.,clean
"We had a great stay! We had booked Annaâs one bedroom, but she upgraded us to the two bedroom cottage. It was perfect! Close walk to the beach and downtown for dinner. We rented bikes from a shop up the street and rode the Strand. Plenty of good options for food in the town. The home was well equipped and comfortable. Thank you, Anna for the great stay!",location
"Overall Anna's place was a comfortable stay. It was very clean and the bed was comfortable.  There was clean linens, towels, shampoo and body wash. Being there for a week, the pans and teapot came Imin handy.<br/>Anna was prompt in responding to any questions and quickly attempting to troubleshoot the temporary network issue. If it's you or a couple Anna's 1 bedroom is a comfortable stay.",clean
Safe beautiful location. Anna is very kind and warm and ready to help with anything any time... I had an amazing stay and the bed and pillows were super comfortable. Loved it there!,location
Great location and great host,location
"Nina was great, let us book an extra day! We are so appreciative. ",clean
I would highly recommend renting this spot! Excellent location; a stones throw from the Palisades Village. Owners are so nice and even let me store my luggage at their house as I had a late flight. Bed is very comfortable and space is cozy! Itâs great. Owners had great communication with me regarding check in as I arrived late at night and this made it super easy to settle in! Itâs a gem!!,location
Ideal location and hassle free check-in. Very nice hosts.,location
"A must stay if youâre in the area for a day or two weeks. Julian and Patsy are amazing hosts. I had everything I needed for a one week stay and I met Patsy, who couldnât have been kinder - she also gave me tips on the area. If you walk 3 minutes, you are right near Ralphâs, which is the local grocery place and many other restaurants/stores. Itâs very quiet - I awoke to birds beautifully chirping every morning. I canât recommend this place enough!",location
"Julian and Patsy are friendly and very welcoming! The room was spotless, in a great neighborhood, and quiet (especially at night!). The Palisades Village is one block away and the beach just down Temescal Canyon Road. Also walking distance to Temescal Canyon Park for some hiking. Would definitely stay again!",clean
A great easy place to stay in Pacific Palisades.,location
Lovely and quiet. The hosts provide a parking pass for the street. Pacific Palisades is lovely and this home is next to everything.,location
"We loved our stay at Julian and Patsyâs! The location is perfect, close to everything. It is easy walking distance to great restaurants, movie theater, grocery store, hiking trails, coffee shops and bookstore. The space is private and thoughtfully set up, with mid-century vibe and touches. They provide everything you need for a comfortable stay: comfortable bed, coffee & tea, water, small fridge and microwave, snacks, interesting books, and a selection of magazines highlighting places of local interest. The back garden is lovely as well, beautifully landscaped with a nice place to sit. We are already planning our next trip back!!",location
Great space. Had everything we needed for our long weekend. Location is close to dining and grocery store.,location
"Great location, very comfortable and clean.",clean
"One of the first things I noticed was the sweet scent of the garden. Julian came out to greet me. The furnishings were comfortable and basic. One can expect to feel comfortable in their place. The backyard is a peaceful place to sit, read, and meditate. I can see enjoying a cup of coffee or tea in this surrounding. It's literally a 3-4 minute walk to the village with all of its shops, restaurants, and markets.",location
"Itâs a cosy and tidy room. Amazing location that close to the Santa Monica. Only take 10 mins driving to the beach and 2 mins walking to the main Sunset Blv where has a local super market and many restaurants, coffee shops over there.",location

"This is a perfect place for a visit to LA with easy access to the beach (highly recommend booking parking and pool pass at Annenberg Community Pool nearby for both pool and beach access),  short drive to both Getty museums,  walking to delicious restaurants and a grocery store for picking up snacks for the beach.  We drove in both nights to eat at fantastic restaurants in West and East Hollywood. Highly recommend.  They offered us their parking pass so we could park on the street near the place.  Clean place and friendly hosts.  Thank you, we enjoyed our stay!!",location
Lovely location in an upmarket and quiet street.<br/>Shops just 1 minute walk and a bus stop for access to nearby Santa Monica.<br/>The toiletries and snacks were a welcome surprise.,location
"Location was amazing! Close to all the beaches and nearby attractions. Quiet, quaint and classy family neighborhood walking distance to stylish coffee shops, restaurants and boutique stores. The room itself is tastefully decorated with everything you need from coffee, tea, sweet treats, and bathroom toiletries. Thereâs plenty of reading options available if you wanted to enjoy a quick read in the garden, and I very much appreciated the restaurant and sightseeing tips provided! The parking permit they provided was also a thoughtful touch. Highly recommend!",location
"Julian and Patsy's place is perfectly located for a trip to Los Angeles. It's very close to a nearby beach, and not a far drive from Santa Monica, Venice, and many other great locations in the city. The neighborhood is adorable, and has some cute cafes and shops nearby. The actual studio had just what we needed, and a great outdoor area where we had morning coffee.

A great place to stay if you are looking for a spot in the Palisades. The apartment is within walking distance of restaurants and shops. Easy parking on the street. Short drive from the beach. Great location!,location
"Itâs a very nice apartment in an amazing area of LA. Super nice houses and close to the beach by car (walking would be a bit far). Very comfy bed. Garden has a nice patio to have breakfast. The only thing to realize is that apart from a fridge and microwave there is no kitchenette nor sink. Some plates and cups are provided but if you think of re-using them, you would need to wash them in the sink in the bathroom. Otherwise we had had great time!",clean
"Julian and Patsy's place is exactly as pictured--a perfect quiet, simple getaway guest spot. They were friendly and available but also gave me privacy. Easy walk to the town of Pacific Palisades, no parking difficulties, easy access to PCH, hiking, beaches, etc. I would stay here again!",location

The washer and dryer was handy and efficient.  The bathroom was all white tile, new & clean with the perfect shower!!!  There was a yard with a weber grill where we were able to entertain family and guests - it was awesome!<br/><br/>The bedrooms were welcoming, spacious and had european cotton linens with very comfortable pillows as well as looking simply <br/>Beautiful!  We were in the perfect central location for everything Santa Monica has to offer!  If you are looking at booking with Nina we highly recommend doing so!  Nina's airbnb was a really great experience!  We look forward to booking with Nina again the next time we fly out to Santa Monica!  ",clean
"Nina is a great communicator and the house is wonderful. The remodeled kitchen boasts cement countertops with all new appliances and the living room is thoughtfully decorated. We felt comfortable immediately. And the iPhone dock was perfect for playing music in the background. Great location, too, because you're only 5-10 minutes from everything in Santa Monica. The house fit four of us quite well. ",location
"Quinn is an excellent host/home owner with a great knowledge of Santa Monica and the surrounding area.  Her place is great: updated, clean, with comfortable beds and new appliances.  We used the Weber gas grill for half of our dinners and enjoyed the 70 degree weather and patio furniture.   Her location is in a lovely neighborhood so close to everything!  Although we rented a car, we enjoyed walking many places. For some destinations, near, but too far to walk, we used UBER at less than $5 per trip.  We definitely look forward to booking with her next time we come to Santa Monica.   Enjoy!<br/>",location
"We had a fabulous time at this cozy place. I can strongly recommend staying there. Quiet neighbourhood, not too far from the beach and some great restaurants. <br/>The apartment is super clean and best of all, it comes with boogie boards that we put to great use at the beach! Communication with Nina was also really easy.",clean

Peggy and her home were wonderful! We were working at the Fairplex all week which is within walking distance.

I would definitely recommend it to others or stay again. ,location
"The home: <br/>Peggy and Phil's home was the setting for my ""getting ready"" wedding photos, and it's the perfect place for it, since there are so many windows for natural lighting to peek through. There are plenty of beds, and even though we only had a group of 6-7, I booked both top and bottom so we would have the extra privacy. The home is exactly as pictured, and has both a modern and vintage feel to it, which I loved! The driveway to get up to the home is steep and narrow, but we had a stretch Escalade SUV limo back into the driveway with no problem, so if anyone else is looking to use for the same purpose, you are good to go!<br/><br/>The hosts:<br/>Peggy and Phil were very accommodating, and were sweet enough to leave mimosa fixings for us, which is a must have for any bride and her maids!

What a clean and inviting space, quiet neighborhood, and great location  (1/2 hour from the airport and Griffith Park, close to the northern canyons where we were attending a wedding at King Gillette ranch, and around the corner from upscale shops and restaurants.) We loved walking to and along Will Rogers beach -- it was practically empty at 7:00 Saturday morning. Julian was super responsive to my question about finding late dinner and made the effort to look up a place for us to eat en route from the airport.  We also liked the LA natural areas/green space map, Topanga Canyon hiking book, etc.  Would definitely come back!",clean

Well thought out living space ... needed more time and a rainy day to check out the in-house library chock full of photography, art and the classics ... great books of the most important photography of the 20th Century plus fun like Calvin and Hobbes and the collected works of one Dallas Burrows, which to tell the truth most know as actor Orson Bean.

We came into town for a wedding, so while I was busy with that the rest of my family got to hang out and enjoy each other in a real home.  Great place!",location
thanks,clean
Peggy is a great communicator and special host who shares her own dream home with airbnb renters! The house is set in a secluded spot with peaceful outdoor spaces and stylish interior. It served as a place of solace and sanctuary during a time of grieving for our family. The amount of space available is dependent on the number of guests although the airbnb quick search does not represent the home as such. This detail is embedded in the home description and caused us some confusion.  I would recommend reading  through the entire description and adjusting number of guests in the reservation tab in order to have a clear understanding of what you would get for what cost. We appreciated our stay in Peggy's home. She offered us latitude with having family visit us at the house despite the request to have only listed guests there and for that we are very grateful.,location

The patio and deck were gorgeous and the hot tub was the perfect was to relax before the wedding. We would LOVE to stay here again!!",location

As advertised, her cozy and well-appointed home was a relaxing home base in a quiet neighborhood. We wish we could have spent more time nestled in the trees!",location
This place is a great retreat to stay when coming to LA. It's a beautiful house with everything you could need and is hidden away in a quiet part of the city so it's very relaxing as well.

Very nice house. Great for a getaway,location
"The Treehouse has some great perks like a full kitchen with dishes, cookware, and utensils to use and a huge grill. Peggy's place also has a lot of outdoor space with peaceful water features and tons of seating. Peggy is a very responsive host. Before you book, I recommend inquiring about the house rules. If you are a group looking for a very private place to live it up a little The Treehouse may not be a good fit due to rules about volume and rules regarding the hot tub. I would highly recommend The Treehouse for families and groups that plan to hang out at the house during the day and then be off on adventures during the evening/night hours. Overall a cozy and relaxing stay though.",location
"In general, this Airbnb was a good experience for our family group of eight. Peggy is very responsive and professional in all communication, and our check-in went very smoothly. The things that worked well for us: communication with Peggy, the open, shared spaces of the living rooms and kitchen, and the location (close to the Claremont schools for the volleyball tournament we were there for). The things that were tougher for us (given that we had our 80-year old parents with us): temperature in the house--despite the fact that there is air conditioning in the house, it really struggles to keep the house comfortable during the heat of the summer; and mattress comfort--three of the four sleeping areas would benefit from newer/more comfortable beds. The downstairs apartment section was also difficult for my kids because of the morning heat that made it hard to sleep past 7am, even with the two fans we put in the room. That said, we made the most of the lovely communal spaces and enjoyed shared meals and visiting, which is what we had hoped for when we planned the trip.",host
"Peggy's house is quite nice, the photos and description are accurate, and she is incredibly easy to talk to, generous, and readily communicative. The property manager Zach was a nightmare to deal with following what should have been a small, readily resolved misunderstanding (2 extra cars in the driveway with 4 extra guests for 1 hour Saturday evening). I received a stream of increasingly rude communications from the property manager along with the reneging of a previously agreed ability to host a free-of-charge small brunch the morning of our checkout (being given the opportunity to find somewhere else or pay a last minute $600). Thankfully that morning we were able to find a change of venue, however that was a difficulty that could have been done without and not the way I would ever do business. Because of Zach's terrible communication style and his combativeness in every message I would not recommend anyone staying here, on the misfortune they have to deal with him. It is a shame to say that, as the house itself is quite nice.",clean
This was the perfect venue for our 7 member family as we attended a weekend wedding for our daughter at Pomona Valley Mining Company. <br/><br/>The space was comfortable quiet and relaxingâ the bed in the master bedroom was exceptionally comfortableâ all great amenities and very close to shoppingâ the hot tub was fantastic and we saw a fair amount of wildlife from the beautiful deckâ including a bobcat and three coyotesâ what a great weekend getaway yet close to everything we needed.<br/> Peggy is a heat host and the house and separate apartment was the perfect place for our family which included a young babyâ<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this place to a family group looking for a relaxing time together in the hills of Pomona.,location
A beautiful secluded place.,location

Be aware that the bathroom is very small.,clean
"Julian & Patsy's is the perfect place to stay at for seeing the local area. It's within walking distance of some shops, a short drive to the beach and the Getty Villa. It's the perfect size for 2. A cozy little hideaway in a busy city! <br/>A tip though- aim to arrive just after 6pm, as parking in any city is crazy, but it eases up once people get off work and head out",location
"This location was so easy and perfect- a short walk from shops, dining, a movie theater, and close distance to the gorgeous beach!

"This was a very comfortable pleasant cottage. It was quiet and private and a good amount of space for us. The kitchen is easy to work in and has everything you need.

"nice place, good size and great location, would recommend for those looking for a 2BD in Santa Monica/Venice area. ",location
"The home was gorgeously decorated with vintage furniture and art. There was a very feminine and sweet vibe to the rental which was perfect for my girls weekend trip. It is situated in a lovely little residential neighborhood however we were still able to walk to the beach, shops, and restaurants. We also rented a car so we could check out other local areas. <br/><br/>The home was clean and the host was a good communicator during our stay. We loved that there was filtered water, wine and small snacks available to us as well. <br/><br/>The bathroom was lovely and clean, but there was low water pressure when taking a shower. This is because there was a regulation showerhead installed to control water usage. Not a big deal but just wanted to share with future guests to set expectations. All in all - a very nice place to stay in! ",clean
"Couldn't be more perfect! Lovely bungalow in an ideal place close to beach and Venice.

Great experience and would love to stay again!",location
"We are so glad we stayed here. It's in a great location and close proximity to the beach and shops.

Its centrally located, and because its not IN beverly hills, you can park overnight, which is REALLY useful. Inside is beautiful and relaxing and the hosts are generous and responsive. ",location
We love the location the neighborhood is great it was close to everything we wanted to be close to. Leor and Tara we're great and very accommodating especially during the big storm that hit the Los Angeles area during our stay which knocked out power to the entire block. They brought us candles and flashlights and checked in on us to make sure we were OK and to apologize even though it was out of their control.<br/><br/>The building is nice and safe just a little bit loud due to a few of the neighbors but overall we had a great experience! Being able to cook and make our coffee allowed us to feel like we were home while traveling. ,location

Overall, nice stay and the hosts were super friendly and accessible...",clean

"Mena's airbnb is perfect. I used to live in Santa Monica (2 blocks from her place!), and so appreciated the proximity to the ocean and Main St. in santa monica. Everything you need is within a 5-25 min walk. Moreover, I appreciated Mena's hospitality. There were welcome snacks on arrival, coffee and tea; there are beach towels, good shampoo and conditioner, and extra towels. Her apartment is adorable, so cozy and comfortable - I really loved her design aesthetic. There are also a million cookbooks, which were fun to peruse and made it feel like home. We didn't have a reason to use the kitchen, but it was a really nice one. There was also a washer/dryer. The beds and pillows were comfy. We appreciated the parking permits as well. ",clean

"The host, Patsy, was racist upon my arrival. After I checked out, I reported her on airbnb and I received an automated message saying the host had canceled the booking and refunded the money to me. Money does not make up for her racism. It seems like a convenient way to hide her racism. She has not addressed it nor has she apologized for treating me inhumanely. <br/>The room was as described and the garden was lovely.",clean

The cottage is charming and cozy, with everything you need to relax: comfy bed, sofa, cute kitchen, lovely back porch and yard with a table for coffee and a view of the sea just a couple of blocks down the hill. Andrew and Bryce were warm and welcoming hosts. Communication was effortless and they made us feel right at home, and we appreciated the bottle of wine and chocolates, and thoughtful guide to the neighborhood! Although we werenât here on a real vacation, we did have a chance to wander down to the beach several times in the mornings and evenings, explore the many many local restaurants and shops (everything one might need is available within walking distance), and start the day watching local surfing with tasty coffee from Scapegoat -- a new coffee shop next to the Hermosa Beach pier. We hope to return, next time on a real vacation that will allow us to spend even more time lounging on the beach! When we do, weâd love to stay at The Beach Cottage. Thanks Andrew and Bryce! Very highly recommended!",location

"The house was very comfortable. It was within walking distance to Gelson's grocery store. We explored Santa Monica and drove into LA a couple of times....I was very happy with the drive time into LA for the wedding. Enjoyed exploring Santa Monica.  Everything was close. We walked to the Santa Monica Pier once  and the rest of the time we drove. I was happy we rented a car. We were able to explore a lot more places. Parking was easy. Overall it was a very pleasant, relaxing and fun long weekend. ",location

Love the locationâso convenient! Felt right at home during my stay. Julian & Patsy made sure I had everything I needed. Would definitely love to stay here again!,clean
"We had a great stay! It is perfectly tucked away and in a safe neighborhood, but still within very close driving distance to everything in Santa Monica, and less than an hour to everything else in the greater LA area. We would definitely stay here again!",location
"This place is really a fabulous choice for those visiting LA. It's in a really nice neighborhood, with nautical design-inspired homes on the street. Within walking distance, are numerous eateries, cute shops, salons and small outdoor live music ensembles. Since these are a few blocks away, you cannot hear them, but you can walk to them in 5 min flat. This location is also close to all the popular beach destinations like Santa Monica, Venice & Malibu. And when you arrive to your chateau, you will find the biggest library at your fingertips, one that reminded me of my home growing up with two parent educators. I had a little time to catch up on Linda McCartney's photo journals of the Sixties, and read the cliff notes for 1984, which I was supposed to read in college. Julian and Patsy are very friendly and welcoming, as well as being eager to share information about the area. Their backyard is so peaceful and lovely, and the neighborhood so quiet. This is a cozy place you will love, and get a lot of LA culture, inside and outside of the unit. Enjoy!",location

"Andrew and Bryce made us feel very welcome.  The house was even better than the pictures.  There was plenty of room.  The beds were very comfortable.  The back patio was lovely, and the view of the ocean is amazing! The location doesn't get any better.  Andrew and Bryce included extra touches (snacks, water, wine, beach towels..even a cooler) which we truly appreciated.  Their positive energy and kindness made us feel that we had a home at the beach.  ",location
"Andrew and Bryce made us feel extremely welcome in their gorgeous beach cottage. We loved our stay, as it is literally a 3 minute walk to the beach, where you can find lots of restaurants, cafes, shops, etc.  Also, the house is extremely clean and beautifully decorated. <br/><br/>Thanks for letting us use your bicycles - the ride on the Strand to Venice Beach and back again was a fantastic experience ! <br/><br/>Thanks again for everything - we would love to come back one day.<br/><br/>Monika & Tom",clean
"Trying hard not to gush through this review, but great hosts, great place, in a great location. Andrew and Bryce were helpful and hospitable in welcoming us and use of the shared space and beach equipment. The beach cottage was clean and had a fun and interesting vibe that added to the experience.  Photos and descriptions were accurate and helpful. They even arranged for absolute perfect weather ;)",location
"Andrew and Bryce were absolutely fabulous hosts! They and this lovely little cottage are exactly what make AirBnB so great. My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights in mid December. We felt totally at home, the cottage very cool, decked out in tons of kitchy but comfortable furniture and accessories. There were many nice touches as well, the bathroom, while small was set up very nicely with nice towels and really good soap and shampoo. Believe me, this may not seem like much, but I travel about 100 nights per year for work, and these are the little touches that can make a stay feel nice, or feel like drudgery. So I do appreciate all the little things that Andrew and Bryce have done to make this feel like home. The neighborhood is great. The place is very close to the heart of Hermosa Beach so lots of great restaurants and shops are within easy walking distance as is the beach itself. They had bikes we could borrow, even a grill we could have used on a longer stay. There was a large bottle of water, and a few other staples waiting for us in the fridge. Really, it felt like we were just staying over at a friend's place. Just a wonderful experience, I can't thank Andrew and Bryce enough for the terrific weekend. My only complaint is on me, I should have stayed longer! <br/><br/>My wife and I just parked the car and holed up in Hermosa for 3 nights. Awesome.<br/><br/>Highly recommended, with no reservation. Really. If you want to hang out in this cool little corner of LA, do it here. And say hey to Andrew and Bryce. Oh, and don't miss their ultra cool shop around the corner. It was a huge bonus that we were there right before Christmas. ",clean
"Andrew and Bryce are great hosts and their beach cottage is equally great.  Clean, spacious, nicely decorated, close to the beach, restaurants, shops - and around the corner from Andrew and Bryceâs shop, Curious (check it out â great finds).  Canât say enough about Andrew and Bryceâs hospitality - left us coffee and wine for us, very friendly, helpful, and accommodating.  Weâll stay there again!  Todd and Diane.",clean
Great stay at Mena's house. House was in a fantastic location. Easy 15  min walk to Main Street where there are so many places to eat. Another 5 mins from main to the beach. Overall the location is perfect and the area feels very safe and welcoming. A lovely cosy house that felt nice to come home to. Parking right outside the house with a space always available. Mena was very quick to respond to emails. We would stay here again. Thanks for a great experience. ,location
A wonderful neighborhood and great walking to the beach and downtown Santa Monica and a number of nice shopping and eating streets.  ,location
"What an awesome place! I stayed here for two weeks in early to mid Jan 2016 whilst working in our LA office (I'm from the UK). I arrived rather late on a Tuesday night, but Andrew and Bryce very kindly waited up for me and provided me with a much needed supper and bottle of wine to help with the jet lag. The cottage was perfect for me - very comfortable, good internet, relaxed atmosphere, and a super terrace out the back where you can see & hear the sea and enjoy the back garden. <br/><br/>I hadn't been to LA before, and Hermosa beach was recommended as one of the best places to stay in the city - quiet yet fun, and most importantly very safe. The cottage is situated just around the corner from a string of good restaurants, bars and shops, and there's a couple of corner shops/liquor stores within a couple of mins walk. Up the street is a very handy launderette, along with a decent sized supermarket should you need it. <br/><br/>Andrew & Bryce are brilliant hosts - they're really friendly, happy to help out with anything I asked of them, and they've done a seriously good job at making the cottage feel like being in your own house. The furniture is really cool, the layout superb and all the extra touches were much appreciated. I didn't have much free time whilst out there due to work, however on the weekend they lent me one of their 'beach cruiser' bikes, and I cycled from Hermosa all the way to Santa Monica and back - a round trip of some 33 miles! (I'd thoroughly recommend it if you have the time - there are cycle paths the whole way down the beach, and it's a great way to see the city).<br/><br/>If I manage to return to LA for another trip, I will definitely try to stay at the cottage again, along with a visit to their great little shop around the corner. Thanks!",location
"This place was absolutely amazing! Andrew and Bryce made sure I (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication during the booking process was perfect and I was welcomed by their shop manager (the shop around the corner is definitely worth a visit!) on arrival to show me everything. Unfortunately I only saw Andrew and Bryce briefly as they went off on holiday themselves. I would really have liked to get to know them better as they seemed both lovely. They made sure to keep communication up during my stay in case I had any questions or needed anything. The place itself is really cute and feels like home, everything you need is there and it's even got views towards the sea from the balcony. I'll definitely stay there again next time and will also warmly recommend their place to friends and colleagues!",location
This place was incredible. I wanted to give my family a true Hermosa Beach experience. My mother and sister were visiting and I wanted to put them up in a place that had some real character. This place completely nailed it. The location was perfect as well. Andrew and Bryce are some of the coolest guys in town. They were very accommodating and genuinely friendly too. My mother and sister were so comfortable and impressed throughout their entire stay. I will absolutely rent the place for any of my friends or family that fly out to visit. ,location
"Andrew and Bryce was a home away from home for my in-laws traveling from Australia. From the minute my in-laws arrived, Andrew & Bryce made them feel welcome, offered their help should they find that the house wasn't equipped with something and ideas for fun excursions around the area. My in-laws raved about the fully stocked kitchen as my mother-in-law was set to cook for us as soon as she arrived. They loved the set up of the place and thought the bed was very comfortable. They also stated that although it's near just about everything in Hermosa Beach that you need and want, the street is quiet and relaxing. Mom had her ""cuppa"" tea outside on the porch every day. The place is in walking distance from our favorite Hermosa Beach shops (like Curious!) and amazing restaurants. You can't go wrong with this place and we will suggest to friends and family for future stays! Thanks again for being great hosts! ",location
"Our experience at Andrew and Bryce's cottage was wonderful right from the start. The hosts had a bottle of wine and everything we could need to make our stay comfortable. In case you forget anything, they have it for you! The cottage is very cozy and bed and linens were very comfortable. It is centrally located and so close to the beach, that we parked our car and didn't use it until we left. We stopped in Bryce's store on Pier Ave and ended up buying so much fun stuff. We will definitely be back! ",location

Julian has an adorable puppy, who we loved meeting, too. Julian gave us directions for a shortcut to the venue for the wedding we wrote attending, saving us from missing the ceremony. Pacific Palisades has a beautiful downtown area, so we were able to take a short walk to shops & restaurants. Short drive to Santa Monica and Malibu.",location

Unfortunately we did not have the chance to meet Bryce and Andrew, who were on holiday them selves, but we communicated very well via email, and Genna helped us out, and was ready with kind assistant if necessary.

Despite its proximity to the nightlife, the neighborhood was nice and quiet at night. <br/><br/>We were met by the house manager, who was very helpful and friendly.   She provided us with a parking pass that was invaluable as parking can become hard to find, especially on the weekends. <br/><br/>The house had everything that we needed, except a washer and dryer, but within a couple of blocks there are 3 places to get your laundry done. I chose a little laundry mat next to a great coffee shop.  The beds were very comfortable for our family of four  and there was a lovely deck overlooking a cute little garden.

White picket fence surrounded the home and its garden filled with flowers and succulents. <br/><br/>The house does not have A/C which is not a problem with the ocean breeze coming through the windows at night, which was a lovely, cool treat for this Texas family. However, there are no screens on all the windows which caused me to worry about the safety of my sleeping family if we left the windows open all night -- so you do need to consider whether you're comfortable with wide-open, unlocked windows to keep cool at night or if you would rather shut them all and be a bit stuffy and warm without A/C.

Mena's home was lovely to stay in during our Labor Day Weekend gal-cation. Although there was no AC which is usually fine for California nights we happened to be there in a heat wave which made it a bit uncomfortable at times but the fans helped a lot. So if you're a sweater be warned if you go in summer. <br/><br/>The house was very clean (I have crazy standards of clean and I was happy with it) and so cozy - we felt like it was our apartment for the weekend!! She had a handy welcome book and a cute welcome basket for us upon our arrival which was a warming touch. <br/><br/>The house was a block away from a bike share program so it made it easy to get down to Venice to explore while getting some exercise!

They were really quick to answer when I had a question and they made sure our stay was as comfortable as it could be. The listing is very accurate, the place is really clean and comfortable. The place is central to Hermosa Beach and you can find restaurants, stores and coffee shops nearby. It can get noisy a bit during weekends but we didn't have any issues with it. There is parking space available on the street if you have a car, but if you don't it is not necessary at all because of the location. I definitely recommend this place!",clean

It has a laid-back beach vibe, has nice shops, and has a great authentic feel about the town. <br/><br/>Also, Andrew and Bryce are the best. They had a bottle of wine waiting for us, were super helpful and responsive  on any questions or tips in the area.

Fully equipped kitchen and a nice patio is great for an evening at home if you don't want to go out. <br/><br/>The host makes you feel extremely welcome and makes an effort for you to have a great time.

Julian and Patsy were very responsive and helpful and were there to greet us and show us to the back where the guest house is. <br/><br/>Small, but very comfortable and cozy and clean. Perfect for me and my girlfriend to crash for a couple nights. <br/><br/>Notes:<br/><br/>*You have to pay a $40 refundable parking pass deposit that you get back when you return the pass at the end<br/><br/>*No TV, so if you wanted to watch something bring a laptop",location
very comfortable and great location!,location
Great location and space.,location

"Another great stay in Pacific Palisades at Julian and Patsys.  Itâs a cute little spot, just as advertised.  Clean, quiet neighborhood, short walk to the cute little town.  Weâll be back for sure",location
We really loved Menas place. We stayed there with my Wife and 1yr old. Its very clean was in the perfect location. Close to everything. She was full of suggestions on food and beaches. Everything we tried was right up our ally. We will def stay here again when we come back to Santa Monica.,clean
"We enjoyed our stay at this AirBnB. The home is nice and airy and the modern yet eclectic decor was just as depicted in the photos. The enclosed yard was great addition since our two young children were able to play outside and we didn't have to worry about them getting into the street. Mena was a great host, helpful and friendly yet gave us our space. The neighborhood is great, good locale from nearby attractions and although the street can be rather busy during the day, traffic definitely slows down at night. We had no issues with noise even while sleeping with the windows open at night.",clean
Mena is a lovely host and her place is exactly as pictured. Beds were comfy and kitchen has everything you need to cook if you choose. Location is perfect. I would definitely stay here again.,location
Mena' house is in a really cute tree lined street that was quiet and family friendly.<br/>The house was really clean with everything we needed for our stay. It was ideally located close to Santa Monica but still felt residential rather than too urban.,clean
"A wonderfully cozy & quiet retreat in a great neighborhood, and just a 2-minute walk to high-end shops, cafes, restaurants, and groceries. Patsy and Julian have mastered the art of hosting, finding the perfect balance between being available if needed and offering their guests complete privacy.  Their rental unit is located in a separate building behind the house, and is cute, clean, and has everything you'll need.",location

Our stay was wonderful! The location is located centrally to most LA activities and the room was beautifully decorated and welcoming. We would happily return here for another stay!,location
The environment here is peaceful and relaxingâthe garden/yard within which the house is set is an extension of the oasis feel. A great find.,location
"Julian and Patsy were lovely hosts. Friendly and fast in communication. Check in was easy. The room is how I imagine an AirBnB: personal, clean and with attention to detail. The room was as shown in the photos. With a new shower. There is a fridge and a small coffee maker. Big enough, clean and very quiet. In the immediate vicinity of the accommodation, which is located in a residential area, there are sufficient opportunities for grocery shopping and eating.<br/><br/>It's about a 10-minute drive to Santa Monica Beach, 10 minutes to the Getty Villa and 20 minutes to the Getty Center.<br/><br/>Parking is easily possible in the residential street. For this you need a visitor's pass, which you can get from Julian for a deposit of $40. Just return the pass upon departure and get the $40 back.<br/><br/>The price-performance ratio is right. I can fully recommend Julian and Patsy's AirBnB. It was a great stay.",clean
"Private and secluded back house with plenty of space and reading materials for the stay.<br/><br/>Wouldâve been nice to have a TV for downtime in the evenings, but the location is perfect for strolls into town and local shopping.<br/><br/>Also very close to Santa Monica and most of what West LA has to offer. <br/><br/>Julian was very friendly and accommodating. Looking forward to staying again next time weâre on the west coast.",location
"Cozy cottage in a quiet neighborhood with a cute, upscale downtown area. The location was close to the ocean, restaurants, hiking trails, and easy freeway access to explore LA. The room was very clean, quiet, and cozy. Great little escape from the busy hustle in LA to rest and unwind with a variety of reading materials.",clean

"Lorens house has a really big and spacious kitchen which I found wonderful and although I ate out the majority of the time, it was really convenient to have everything I needed! She is walking distance to Earth Bar (amazing) as well as a big grocery store (Gersons market) and Hollyway Dry Cleaners! She is also a short drive to a Wholefoods market!<br/><br/>I loved having the company of her two cats, having pets of my own, I appreciated having them around to greet me home. The house is very clean, you have a separate bathroom and the room is warm and welcoming.<br/><br/>I encourage anyone in LA to have a car (buses are a no no) otherwise download the Uber app! Loren is close to pretty much everything, Melrose Ave and Santa Monica Blvd. she is very friendly, helpful and even took me out to a great restaurant on one of my first evenings here.<br/><br/>This place would suit someone who enjoys a clean, pretty home who is respectful and private. Loren lives in the home, so it's important that you are aware of that! That said, I myself occasionally came home late but it was never a problem. The neighborhood is very safe and in the nicer area of West Hollywood. It's a short drive to Sunset Plaza and Robertson Blvd! <br/><br/>I would certainly stay here again because Loren and I have so much in common! We are both vegetarians, have pets and practice a green living lifestyle so if you're anything like that- Lorens your lady! She has advice about the best restaurants, shopping and cafes and she's always happy to help. I will be keeping in contact with her as she has grown to be a friend of mine.",clean

Great house with lots of amenities!,location
"We had a wonderful stay at Mena's house while we were evacuated from our home in Ojai. Not only is the house super cute, but it's also really comfortable. I slept in the queen bed and it was extra comfortable and cozy. The kitchen has nice cookware and it was great to have a washer and dryer too. We walked to the beach and to get meals. It took us about 30 minutes with our 4 year old and then we would use a lyft to come back home. The neighborhood is super cute and residential, which we liked. It's also very centrally located. Mena was a wonderful host, replying right away and helping whenever we needed something. Hope to stay here again! Thanks, Mena!!",location

"Great place, great host, great neighborhood. Highly recommended.",location
We really enjoyed our stay in Santa Monica and Mena's place was the perfect home base for us as we explored the area. It was rainy the first two days of our stay and Mena kindly left umbrellas for us to use. Our 10 year old son enjoyed the boogie board she had available to use and said it was the most fun he'd ever had in the water. Arriving to a nice basket of snacks and bottles of filtered water were much appreciated after a long day of travel. Thank you Mena!,location
"We had a magical time in this charming space! Not only is everything beautiful and stylish, but we had absolutely everything we needed. We enjoyed visiting a nearby farmer's market on our first day, and prepared some awesome meals with the well-appointed kitchen and BBQ grill. The beds were very comfortable, and there was plenty of closet and dresser space. We loved the bowl of meyer lemons from the yard, and squeezed them into our drinks al week. Loved the beach towels, chairs, boogie board, and toys, too. Mena is obviously one of AirBnB's top hosts, and I'd recommend her place to anyone.",clean

The building also houses a beautiful pool, if you are looking to cool off after a long day of sightseeing.<br/>Loren is very inviting, hospitable and kind hearted. She had plenty of suggestions for local eateries and was proactive in researching transport alternatives and events in LA during our short stay. Loren even drove us to a restaurant late one night after a long & tiring day.<br/><br/>Overall a great location.. Can walk to sunset blvd, Santa Monica blvd & Beverley centre, otherwise an inexpensive Uber ride to Hollywood blvd, Venice Beach, Santa Monica pier.<br/>Perfect location, Perfect host who we will continue to stay friends with..

"Being a frequent airbnb user, Iâve had the most amazing stay with Loren. Her place is simply gorgeous, immaculately clean and located in one of the best areas in Los Angeles. So convenient, it is less than a block to a grocery store, and there are many restaurants, cafes and shops within a very short walk. At the same time itâs tucked onto a quiet street, so it's very peaceful and serene, with a little park right across the street. In addition to the accommodation being top notch, Loren was the best host I could wish for. She me very warmly with a delicious snack and made me feel at home right away. Throughout my stay she was so helpful and friendly, she even invited my to join her to the movie, and go do some Christmas shopping. She was genuinely caring, like a mother, and and went out of her way to accommodate me when I had travel changes and even helped me with moving.

"This is such a nice little retreat in the Palisades, I really appreciated and enjoyed my stay there. The room is in a lovely garden and is close to everything -- grocery store, drug store, Starbucks, etc. The room has a microwave and a mini-fridge and plastic utensils and napkins -- you should be prepared for the fact that you won't be able to prepare anything beyond a frozen meal, or some fruit and yogurt, and a hot drink in the microwave or the coffee maker. Parking is available on the street -- I never had difficulty finding a place, although you do need a permit for street-parking, which Julia and Patsy provided for a $40 fee that they refunded within minutes of my departure. Julian and Patsy were very responsive whenever I had a question, I don't think I ever waited more than an hour for a response and usually not that long. I highly recommend this place, it was perfect for me. Next time I come to LA I'll try to stay here.",location

The apartment is also a short drive for some amazing canyon hikes, tennis courts and public libraries. And it's safe to walk around at night.<br/><br/>As far as Loren is concerned... she would make a great App. Better still, when 'Alexa' gets upgraded, it should be for a 'Loren'. She knows this place inside out and has wonderful taste in all things cultural. She is a wonderful, spiritual human with a huge heart and a wicked sense of humour (she might look all innocent with that baby face but inside she really gets people and life).<br/><br/>'Super Host' is an under statement for you Loren.

"Great place to stay! Jen's condo was very spacious, neat and organized. There were plenty of little shops and restaurants nearby, which is nice if you don't feel like going anywhere far to get food. My only tiny complaint was the shower. Mind you, I'm rather small @ 5'2 - 110 lb yet I felt really trapped and uncomfortable everytime I got in.<br/><br/>Other than that, I'd definitely recommend this place if you plan to visit LA, but dont want to deal with the noise, small hotel space and expensive parking fees!!",clean
Everything is good. Strongly recommended!,clean
I stayed at Jen's place with the intention of spending a night out in LA. Jen provided easy direction to get into her place.  There was plenty of free parking in the structure. The place was very clean and I was in love with all the home decor.  Overall I would definitely stay at this place again.  ,clean
"My husband and I chose Jen's place because we needed a place to stay for one night while visiting LA. We visited Little Toyko, Koreatown and The Grand Central Market which was 15-20 minutes from her condo. Everything she advertised was accurate. Her condo is located above the Atlantic Square Shopping Center. Parking was a little confusing at first because you have to drive through the underground parking to get to the residential parking. Loved how she has assigned parking! The underground parking was lit and open. We felt very safe! When we entered her condo we were so amazed!! Jen's place gets 10 stars for cleanliness. Her place was so open but very cozy. The bed was so comfy, the sheets were warm, bathroom was clean and our favorite was her private patio. It literally looked down to the shopping center!! They played live music downstairs so went down to check it out. They have many restaurants and shops downstairs and I have to mention that they have Lee's Sandwiches which is super convenient. If you do not like noise this place is also for you! As long as you shut her door you will no longer hear the outside noise. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and have recommended our friends to stay at Jen's place while visiting LA! Thanks, Jen! ",location

Kitchen had everything ready, surprisingly no damage on the pots and pans like most other Airbnb provide, most of the items are like new.
