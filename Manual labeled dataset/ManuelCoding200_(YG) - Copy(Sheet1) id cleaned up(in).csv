The other reviews are more than accurate, but I was so pleased I wanted to chime in. <br/>First, the host truly cares about the experience you have. If you like hotels (and who doesn't) this apartment will give you that feeling *and more.* Don't waste $400/night at a hotel, stay at Ari's. <br/>My stay was for 3 nights. The fridge had key things you'd need (incl candy, and I put that in the """"""""need"""""""" category), and there were amenities in the bathroom as well. My chargeable Panasonic toothbrush died but no worries-- they had a travel toothbrush kit in the cabinet! Unlike at a hotel, no extra charges for whatever you use, which is awesome. <br/>I'm not a drinker, but there were beers in the fridge and even wine available. I prefer tea, and a kettle was right there. Score! Prefer coffee? They got that, too. <br/>Untimately, you can show up at Ari's with just the clothes on your back and a few toiletries and you're good to go. <br/>Things can go wrong, and for a bit the internet went down, but what matters is how the host reacts when there's an issue: I messaged Ari, he responded within 5 minutes and was right on it with the ISP. It was fixed fast. <br/>There's no bathtub, but the shower is *fantastic,* & includes a rainshower head. <br/>Parking in a secure garage, near everything, and a quiet bluilding. I'm a writer, and was able to get lots of work done. <br/>The apt is beautifully renovated and appointed, but the rest of the bldg is not, but don't let that put you off, it's not really a factor in the experience. <br/>I also appreciated the fact that I encountered security guards in and outside of the bldg keeping an eye on things. There's a doorman and a secure front entrance. The apt is on the first floor & faces the street but is obscured by plants and trees, and I found no issues with noise. AC/heaters in both the LR and BR. <br/>You can't go wrong. <br/>Thanks Ari and Shab for making it so easy :) <br/>"""" extremely happy aris review accurate pleased wanted chime host truly care experience like hotel apartment feeling waste night hotel aris night fridge key thing need incl candy need category amenity bathroom chargeable panasonic toothbrush die worry travel toothbrush kit cabinet unlike hotel extra charge use awesome drinker beer fridge wine available prefer tea kettle right score prefer coffee untimately aris clothe toiletry good thing wrong bit internet matter host react issue message ari respond minute right isp fix fast bathtub shower fantastic include rainshower head park secure garage near quiet bluilde writer able lot work apt beautifully renovate appoint rest bldg let factor experience appreciate fact encounter security guard outside bldg eye thing doorman secure entrance apt floor face street obscure plant tree find issue noise acheater wrong thank ari shab easy """,extremely happy aris review accurate pleased wanted chime host truly care experience like hotel apartment feeling waste night hotel aris night fridge key thing need incl candy need category amenity bathroom chargeable panasonic toothbrush die worry travel toothbrush kit cabinet unlike hotel extra charge use awesome drinker beer fridge wine available prefer tea kettle right score prefer coffee untimately aris clothe toiletry good thing wrong bit internet matter host react issue message ari respond minute right isp fix fast bathtub shower fantastic include rainshower head park secure garage near quiet bluilde writer able lot work apt beautifully renovate appoint rest bldg let factor experience appreciate fact encounter security guard outside bldg eye thing doorman secure entrance apt floor face street obscure plant tree find issue noise acheater wrong thank ari shab easy,1,2,,2,2,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,

He made me feel welcome instantly and bent over backwards to make sure I had everything from satin sheets to fluffy towels to feeling at home right away. He also turned out to be a really nice guy, caring and sharing, and funny. The room is comfy and has plenty of closet space and dresser drawers, and bright windows on two sides, plus a desk and several chairs. The area has all the conveniences and restaurants one needs and really is 30 minutes from anywhere in LA by car, with public transportation easily accessible also. The pool is a nice addition (as is the Entertainment Room he has for rent) and the roommate, Mark, is a cool and pleasant and interesting additive. It is a real pleasure staying here and Matt constantly does his best to make guests feel comfortable. Unless you had to stay in the heart of Hollywood/LA, I couldn't recommend this more, and a lot of that has to do with Matt's approach to ensuring guests are comfortable from the very beginning.",matt welcome instantly bent backwards sure satin sheet fluffy towel right away turn guy care share funny room comfy plenty closet space dresser drawer bright window plus desk chair area convenience restaurant need minute car public transportation easily accessible pool addition entertainment room rent roommate mark cool pleasant interesting additive real pleasure matt constantly guest comfortable heart hollywoodla recommend lot matts approach ensure guest comfortable beginning,1,1,,2,1,,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,

Upon arrival there were other guests staying in other parts of the same house and other people on the property seemingly. Nothing was very clear. I was told it was per friendly but the host called Airbnb and tried to have us leave after one day because the dog that travels with my crew was barking too much and disturbing people. Well i thought i rented an âentire placeâ. We worked that out and then he sent me a video where you hear a small dog who is 15 btw, let out a bark maybe twice in 3 minutes - he said it was bothering other guests- he didnât realize the dog would be left alone while we were out. And basically the host was on the property tending to a pile of old things outside that he needed to sort out. There was no real light in the place - only pink and blue lights. The bedroom has zero lights and we had to bring in a utility light from one of our jobs to see. The house is so secluded on the top of a mountain that once we were back at the house from work there was no leaving until the next day. My employees who travel for us often said it was the worst experience they have ever had at an Airbnb. And ended up leaving two days early and getting their own hotel rooms because of our uncomfortable they were.

Not only was it close to the hospital but it is in an amazing area of LA (that I look forward to coming back to explore in happier times). I really just needed a place to sleep and shower, but I got SO much more. The apartment was a safe haven, a place of respite from the stress of hours spent at hospital. The bed was unbelievably comfortable with silky soft sheets - and the shower was enormous and luxurious with soft, fluffy (and plentiful) towels. The apartment itself is super clean and modern with comfortable, stylish furniture and adorned with gorgeous art. But it was the little things that really made this such a wonderful Airbnb experience. The easy (and early) check in. The personal and genuinely thoughtful welcome note. The bottle of wine (much needed). The delicious chocolate chip cookies (not at all needed, but devoured nonetheless). The provisions in the fridge. The private patio. I didn't get a chance to use the pool or the gym, but they looked great. I didn't even have time to do my laundry but there is a washer and dryer right there in the apartment for your convenience.

5078176,102910994,9/19/2016,17396297,Maziar,"If I have to say something regarding my experience, I would simply put ' It was a Neato ' . An awesome experience amongst all the journeys I had so far. It was like a ' multicultural assembly ' from all around the world (youâll know it after reading Mattâs guest books). During my stay, I had a chance to meet with cool people from Germany, India ... and even wonderful Texans; and all of âem regardless of nationality and cultural differences, were so close and friendly like they know each other for years. Donât know if this had to do with their (these People) Personalities or the atmosphere of the home or Mattâs behavior which turned people to be cool and have fun together ; and no matter how was your day, the afternoon among the others always turns out to be a cool fun time. We even did cooking in turns, each cooked her/his traditional cuisine and common dishes from their countries. Matthew and I did some gardening too which was so fun the way he pruned the bushes. We had several Barbecue gatherings, â¦ even a surprise birthday party, which Me and Matt arranged For ' Nadine ' (one of the cool guests from Germany). The living room is more like a full-equipped home-theatre, there is a large collection of DVDs of any genera and Mattâs also a rock fan which is obvious by looking at his Room. Regarding his personality I should say: he resembles a wrestler in the middle of a serious and breath-taking battle, suddenly pops and bursts a laughing bomb which turns a heavy match to a laughing comedy. He doesnât take anything too serious, always cheerful, reliable, helpful and doesnât mind sharing his knowledge and helps you or even drives you to your destination (if you are not familiar with the area); he is also a well-organized person who cares a lot about hygiene and cleaning and you can see that in a super clean house; and in one word, despite he is young, you can't find a significant weak point in his personality. Heâs in love with sports and particularly soccer (taking a look at his garage you can see that) and he tried his hand at almost any sport from golf to surfing to biking and so on... ; It seems like he has experience in anything you could think of, from coaching to gardening to mechanicsâ¦; He has a classic mustang, following a family legacy on collecting classics; and He has a Pit Bull, LEROY , which is so cool and Behaves , Friendly which I Grew Fond of It . The saddest part was that unfortunately I had to move and couldn't be there to go along with them to the rock festival (Ozz / Rock Fest). I wish the Best for Matthew and his Family, especially his cool dad Bruce, and I wish for Matt not to change his life style and never to lose the pace.",regard experience simply neato awesome experience journey far like multicultural assembly world know read matts guest book chance meet cool people germany india wonderful texans regardless nationality cultural difference close friendly like know year know people personality atmosphere matts behavior turn people cool fun matter day afternoon turn cool fun time cook turn cook herhis traditional cuisine common dish country matthew garden fun way prune bush barbecue gathering surprise birthday party matt arrange nadine cool guest germany living room like fullequippe hometheatre large collection dvds genera matts rock fan obvious looking room regard personality resemble wrestler middle breathtaking battle suddenly pop burst laugh bomb turn heavy match laugh comedy cheerful reliable helpful mind share knowledge help drive destination familiar area wellorganize person care lot hygiene cleaning super clean word despite young find significant weak point personality love sport particularly soccer look garage try hand sport golf surfing biking like experience think coach gardening mechanic classic mustang follow family legacy collect classic pit bull leroy cool behave friendly grow fond saddest unfortunately rock festival ozz rock fest wish good matthew family especially cool dad bruce wish matt change life style lose pace,1,,,2,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The charm of the old building was wonderful and the space (studio) was perfect for a short stay. <br/>Here's the reason I won't be giving 5 stars, not 4, not 3, not 2....it was filthy! I mean, I can't believe there is a cleaning fee!<br/>The wood floors can't have been swept or mopped (although there is a swifter in the closet), the hard jute rug had potato chip crumbs next to the bed, the comforter had hair and other unidentifiable particles on it, the only sleeping pillows were covered with pillow shams (not pillow cases) which leads me to think these are not washed when/if the sheets are changed. The white fabric shower curtail had disgusting black stains on it (several of them) and the bathroom rug looked like it hadn't been washed in quite some time. I would expect a clean rug to step onto after a shower but this was not clean. I was totally heebie-jeebied out taking a shower there. <br/><br/>There are no screens on the Windows and the blinds are covered in dust!

I stayed for two weeks and did a lot of cooking, loved it that the kitchen had everything I needed. The host, Alexander, is super nice and easy to communicate with. Overall, an awesome place that I highly recommend!",look away far topanga wonderful visit high mountain minute drive ocean lovely plenty space personal large deck view hang week lot cooking love kitchen need host alexander super easy communicate overall awesome highly recommend,1,1,1,1,,,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,
