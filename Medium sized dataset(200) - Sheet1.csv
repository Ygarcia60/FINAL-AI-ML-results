109,74506539,2016-05-15,22509885,Jenn,"Me and two friends stayed for four and a half months. It was a great place to stay! The apartment was very comfortable and I really enjoyed having the park with running path across the street. The only downside was it wasn't within walking distance to restaurants, bars, or coffee shops. But they are a short drive away. Overall, great stay!"
2708,13994902,2014-06-09,10905424,Kuberan,i had a wonderful stay. Everything from start to the end was perfect.<br/><br/>Will come back again.
183319,988343,2012-03-11,1219947,Gabriella,"very nice and cozy apartment, well located in Venice Beach. I had a great experience!"
183319,184002210,2017-08-18,70046039,Yan,We loved the experience. The location couldn't have been better. The accommodation is spacious and comfortable. Will definitely come back again!
183319,417033350,2019-02-25,20536088,Rui,"Barbara's place is located right next to the famous Venice Boardwalk, it's literally less a minute away.<br/><br/>The house is spacious and we had a great time there."
184314,502940,2011-09-05,899455,Julie,"Absolutely loved it, Ashley's place is amazing! Definitely made my stay in LA incredibly comfortable and relaxing I wont hesitate to check for availability any time I travel to the west coast."
184314,845777,2012-01-06,111921,Conrad,"Super peaceful place a block from the beach, with quality linens, warm decor, and good karma."
184314,1057730,2012-03-29,1627372,Lacy,"My mom was looking for a place to relax by the beach within walking distance to coffee, food, shops, and of course the glorious ocean;) This place is amazing!!! Perfect location and so warm and cozy!!! Andrea was so helpful and always got back to me right away!! My mom absolutely loved it!!! We are ready to plan her next trip!! Thanks for everything!! Xoxo"
184314,1898293,2012-08-06,2057732,Eleanor,I had such an amazing time. The place is clean and tidy and it really felt like a home away from home. I was always able to get in touch with the host and my moving-in and out transitions were incredibly smooth. I can't wait to go back next month!
184314,1939188,2012-08-10,2445802,Jenna,"Andrea's apartment is in the most perfect location in Venice Beach.  It is a 2 minute walk to the most beautiful beach and a 5 minute walk to lots of bars and restaurants.
<br/>
<br/>Her apartment was clean, very spacious and beautiful.  Check in was so easy.
<br/>
<br/>We will definately be back as soon as we can can.
<br/>
<br/>Thank you so much!!"
184314,1985088,2012-08-14,2969873,Shanti,"Andreas' home was sweet. Great location! It felt safe and had a good feeling. You can walk to the beach and main area. There was one issue with parking due to a dark street and an obscured parking sign which gave me a big parking ticket. But Andrea said for future people she will let them know about parking (for those of us country folk who live n places where parking is never an issue, it's good info to have!). Andrea was very sweet and I definitely recommend her place."
2708,14606598,2014-06-23,2247288,Camilla,"Charles is just amazing and he made my stay special. He is so nice, helpful and absolutely polite. Charles is always there when you need some advice or help and totally respects your privacy too. I could concentrate on my work while Charles was doing his work - also absolutely quiet. The apartment is perfectly tidy, very clean, with tasty furniture and beautiful details. My bedroom even had a desk in it. Also, the apartment is located in a perfect area, most sightseeing spots are in walking distance and there are some very nice restaurants around as well. I highly recommend this place!"
184314,2013305,2012-08-17,2980150,Deborah,"Positive:The Apartment looks exactly as in the pictures at the time of my booking. The area looked safe. The building has a key/locked gate/door that was always locked which is good (you'll get a key). There was no noise from neighbors at night and I'm a light sleeper! The bed was very comfortable. Great books to read next to bed! You can walk to the beach or Starbucks. Location was great. 
<br/>
<br/>The only negative is the apt could be cleaned a little better. 
<br/>Andrea responded to all my messages. I recommend it."
184314,2077009,2012-08-23,2347429,Paul,"Had an incredible stay at Ashley's beach pad.  Cozy, relaxing, and 1 block from the beach!  Ashley was very accommodating and helpful with helping me get settled and made sure I had everything I needed.  Highly recommended!!  One thing to note is that if you rent a car, parking can tend to get very difficult around the area on weekends.  Other than that, it proved to be the perfect getaway pad for me."
184314,2426038,2012-09-27,2057732,Eleanor,Another great stay! An ideal home for holiday and relaxing or if like me - to work from. The house is fully equipped and there is never any stress moving in or out. The apartment is just a couple of blocks away from fun bars and is right on the beach - I already miss doing my morning run everyday.  The only trouble is parking because everyone wants to be there!
184314,2983241,2012-11-27,3083786,Toby,"Great place to stay right by the beach, great energy in the apartment and easy access to all kinds of good stuff."
184314,3590546,2013-02-19,3805507,Kim & Ian,"We had a phenomenal trip to LA, thanks in no-small-part to Ashley's beautiful apartment. Ashley's place is beautifully decorated, clean and ideally located literally a block from the beach. Would definitely stay here again and will recommend it to friends. Thanks again, Ashley!"
184314,5607115,2013-07-08,6550377,Heike,It was a very pleasant stay and it's really a great location! A 2 Minutes walk only to the beach and 5 Minutes to many restaurants at Venice Beach. We rented bycicles and had a lot of fun. Andrea has a very comfortable bed and we slept very well in her bungalow.
184314,6229336,2013-08-04,7612018,Vicki,"Great location, clearly a home that includes a lot of love. Inspiring yoga lifestyle. Comfy bed, slept incredibly well. Wi-Fi worked brilliantly! Question about cleanliness which she offered to fix immediately."
51307,181228,2011-02-12,268109,David,"The place is as advertised--quaint and clean in a wonderful neighborhood, one of the few true walking neighborhoods in LA with fabulous restaurants on Los Feliz and Glendale Boulevards steps away. The full bed is a squeeze if you need a lot of room to stretch out but great for a romantic weekend.  David, the owner, was available, easy to work with, and very conscientious.  Would definitely go back."
51307,187539,2011-02-23,228580,India,"David was a wonderful host.  Incredibly helpful and a fountain of knowledge.  The appt was super homely, with all the kitchen equipment you could need.  A comfy bed and a hot shower.  I felt very 'at home' almost immediately.  It has a sunny little yard and a balcony too.  I would definately stay here again.  The only downsides are the lack of WiFi (but that makes you hang out more in nice cafes...Kaldi Coffee is a nice place with good music and cool staff) and the fact that I didn't get chance to have a coffee and a natter with David as he seemed so kind and interesting."
2708,39597339,2015-07-25,27974696,Fallon,Staying with Chas was an absolute pleasure. He was very accommodating and respectful of personal space. He is truly a nice person. He was very helpful and I am grateful that he opened up his home to me. I am glad to have met him.
2708,61157407,2016-02-01,33226412,Haroon,"Charles is a most wonderful host. I enjoyed my stay, the bed is comfortable, and the apartment is well appointed and always clean. Thanks Charles for a fantastic Airbnb experience."
51307,206866,2011-03-22,438795,Kate,"We had a great stay.  The guest house was a little bigger than we imagined with a little dining room, living room, and kitchen.  There is a back yard area with picnic table that is fairly secluded.  The bathroom has a proper tub.  This place is definitely cozy--you'll be sleeping on a double bed which means you'll be sleeping close if you're a couple.  The neighborhood is really nice, my bf was visiting from out of town and he walked to the bakery, grocery, bar etc when I was working late and had the car.  I even looked into a longer sublet I liked this place so much, but alas the dates did not work out.  Definitely recommended, especially after seeing the hotel a friend of ours was staying in that same weekend!"
51307,218685,2011-04-05,306787,Marie & Peter,My husband & I enjoyed a wonderful Birthday weekend at David's beautiful house which is situated in a lovely neighborhood very convenient to Griffith Park and Atwater Village - walk everywhere! His house is very well appointed - clean and comfortable. We didn't cook but could have as everything needed was there.
51307,236499,2011-04-23,176658,Rami,"Very nice, quiet, cozy and totally charming! I would love to stay there again."
184314,10658964,2014-03-02,11188417,Stephanie,The tranquil yoga beach bungalow was the perfect remedy for me this year.  Getting out of the East Coast during one of the worst winters to a spiritual retreat I couldn’t ask for anything more!  The living room was spacious and the bedroom was calm and soothing. I enjoyed spending time outdoors on the garden like balcony with the sounds of the soothing wind chimes on a beautiful sunny California day.  Everywhere I turned there was something new and exciting to look at especially the inspirational quotes that made each day brighter than the next.  Its owner was one of kindest and most easy-going people that made my stay wanting me to come back sooner rather than later!
184314,11580832,2014-04-08,8102435,Sascha,"Amazing Andrea - Amazing apartment.  INCREDIBLE location - we love Marina del Rey.  Starting with Andrea - who was incredibly warm and kind and helpful (only wish she'd been in town so we could have got to know her better!) - everyone was so friendly in the neighbourhood - the apartment is incredibly spacious with a wonderful feel to it and it's two blocks from the beach.  What more could you ask for?  Highly recommended.  
<br/>Feel free to contact me if you have an questions - we stayed for 5 weeks so we know the apartment and area well.  Other boring but maybe helpful things - the kitchen is fully equipped, the couch large and comfy, a very big dinning table, balcony with grill (which we stupidly didn't use!) and the bedroom is enormous.  Laundry facilities are in the same block - less than a one min walk from the apartment.  Even the apartment building has a wonderful, flower and tree strewn centre - just gorgeous!"
184314,19474187,2014-09-13,4812476,Misha,"Andrea was an amazing host, very helpful and provided all necessary information upfront. The apartment is in such a great location for our month long stay in LA while getting acquainted with the local area. 
<br/>The kitchen has everything you would need and the apartment is a decent size for a one bedroom. We would definitely return!"
184314,38899055,2015-07-19,15867286,Nanci,"Ashley is an amazing hostess. Her instructions for entry were easy to follow and the apartment is exactly as it looks in the photos. It is an incredible space, full of light and only a few steps away from the loveliest stretch of beach I've ever seen. Each night I watched the sunset and every day woke up to smell of fresh ocean air. The apartment is very quiet and peaceful, perfect for writing my first book! I will definitely be back. The neighborhood is a hidden gem among the Venice Beach craziness. It is close to everything and yet away from the hustle and bustle too. You get to choose!"
184314,40963480,2015-08-03,15867286,Nanci,"Wow, my stay at Ashley's was so amazing, I extended my trip. Her place was a sanctuary for me. Walking to the sand and watching the sunset became my nightly ritual. The apartment is open, light, and ideally located. I wish I could have stayed longer. The neighborhood is very safe and in no time I felt like a local. I only put 70 miles on my car during my stay since I walked everywhere. It was an incredible delight and treat to call her place ""home."""
184314,43069922,2015-08-17,37092119,Jonathan,"Andrea was a wonderful host and a lovely person. The apartment description was accurate; ie: warm and cozy and in a fantastic location. Minutes walk to Venice Beach and the best cafes, restaurants and bars, while Santa Monica just a short drive away.  I couldn't have imagined a better place to stay while in LA."
184314,58069021,2015-12-31,1099146,Amelia,"The apt is very comfortable - in every sense of the word, has all the details you'd need for a short or long stay and is perfectly located along the beach. I watched the sunrise and set daily, walked to shops and cafes w ease. I will most defiantly return and always keep very fond memories of my time at this sanctuary."
184314,58969206,2016-01-05,2601314,Chrissy,"Andrea was an absolutely wonderful host.  Her place was stylish, peaceful, and a great spot to stay during my business trip.  The location is amazing--just a block from the beach.  I watched the sunset every night I was there."
184314,64749344,2016-03-07,1233496,Trinity,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
184314,68180253,2016-04-02,11522257,Felix,great place! I loved it. thanks Andrea!
184314,78519486,2016-06-07,1494679,Geoffrey,"Great experience, I would book this place again!"
184314,81179145,2016-06-21,12742881,Yassi Jasmine,"Andrea's apartment is so relaxing and in the perfect location! I love that it's so close to the beach and all the shops/restaurants, and that there's private parking. Her apartment is beautifully decorated and made me feel like I was home. Andrea also made checkin and checkout very easy. I had a wonderful stay and hope to be back again."
184314,84208077,2016-07-06,17809236,Kathi,"I was never able to access the apartment.  I had the address which was different on the building, and didn't have a unit number.  I tried to contact owner and sent message, but never heard back.  Had to go to hotel."
184314,91376915,2016-08-05,4327320,Theresa,"Andrea's apartment is very comfortable and perfectly located, only steps from one of the nicest beaches in LA. Although I never met Andrea, check-in was easy and she responded quickly to all of my questions. I hope to be back soon!"
184314,93860886,2016-08-14,14325807,Al,"The apartment is fantastic. Great location, very clean and a lot more secure than other places I've stayed locally!"
184314,108642992,2016-10-16,4327320,Theresa,Second time staying here – and it was as comfortable and relaxing as the first! Hope to be back soon.
184314,220858664,2017-12-24,21465119,Alex,The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2708,66196280,2016-03-20,23408691,Massimo Litterio,Chas is a really good host. He gives me a lot of good advice during my stay. Always trying to make my stay as much comfortable as possible.
2708,222420570,2017-12-29,155985882,Manami,ﾎｽﾄはとても親切で英語の発音の仕方など丁寧に教えてくれた。<br/><br/>部屋はﾘﾋﾞﾝｸﾞを板で仕切っているのであまりﾌﾟﾗｲﾊﾞｼｰが守られていない。<br/>朝になると電話の音やｷｯﾁﾝの音や話し声がそのまま聞こえる。<br/><br/>ﾊﾘｳｯﾄﾞの中心地から歩いて15分程なのでﾛｹｰｼｮﾝは最高はとても便利。<br/>ｽｰﾊﾟｰやその他ｼｮｯﾌﾟ､ﾊﾞｽ停も徒歩5分以内。
2708,225209928,2018-01-05,6840784,Diego,"Chas house feels like home, it is clean, it has bright energy, it’s mystical, it’s fabulous. Charles is a very hospitable man, kind and soft hearted, he made me feel well looked after and confortable. Thank you for your time, I learned about myself."
2708,227042674,2018-01-13,162469426,Hanbin,"1. Clean 2. Host is very friendly 3. Reasonable price 4. Good location 5.Very comfortable to use buses and subways 6. Much better than pictures 7. With sauna, swimming pool, gym, laundry room<br/>I recommend this room! It was much better than a hotel. :)"
185536,425064,2011-08-06,869003,Shweta,Laura was a great host! She was very kind and generous. I was on the standby list and she offered me her place. And not only that- she was kind enough to offer me a ride too. Thanks Laura! Had nice time staying with you :)
185536,13824444,2014-06-05,14754949,Liyi,"This is my first time to booking a room in AIRBNB, it's really big surprise!  Laura is a sooooo nice and great host, I really could not find any other sweet word to describe the time I spend in her home.  She pick me up in Airport, invite me join her family dinner, share her real life with me and give me lots of help to adapt my new life here,  just highly recommended to choose Laura's home and you will have chance to experience a kind of real America life here."
185536,16966075,2014-08-04,18881462,Ericka,"This was my first experience with airbnb and my first time in LA. Laura made it wonderful. She took time to show me around the city and also made me feel extremely welcomed in her home. It was like staying with an old friend. The next time I travel I will use airbnb and if I come back to LA,  I will definitely try to stay with Laura."
185536,20441605,2014-09-29,2064693,Ana Maria,"My first experience with Airbnb was (Website hidden by Airbnb)  host, Laura made me feel most welcome. It was like staying with an old friend. Thank you! :)"
185536,191475611,2017-09-07,40615199,Yining,"Laura is a super nice host! She was very clear about house rules and frequently checked in with me to make sure everything goes well. She also offered to drive me to laundry every time. The red room was cozy with a big bed. It can get a little hot during the day in the summer, and Laura gave me a fan. I also had a personal fridge (surprise!). The location is close to the airport and grocery stores are within walking distance. There is a little too much stuff around the house, but overall it was a great stay! Thanks Laura!"
185536,236590214,2018-02-19,3429907,Ella,I had a great stay at Lauras. It suited me perfect for this occasion. It's a home full of stuff from Lauras various trips around the world.
185536,244855678,2018-03-19,171196528,Caitlin,"Laura is an incredibly hospitable, kind, helpful, earth mother mermaid. I felt more than welcome and comfortable my whole stay with her and the other ladies at the house. It’s a very peaceful and serene household. Her two pups are very friendly and sweet. The surrounding neighborhood is quiet but has some shops and restaurants within walking distance and it’s only a 15 min drive to Venice Beach! The room I stayed in is very artsy and warm, nice big comfy bed and also equipped with a mini fridge, I really love it! Thanks Laura!"
185536,294224423,2018-07-21,178631062,Valentina,"I spent about 2 months at Laura's home and I had a great time!<br/>My room was big, clean, with a private fridge and wi-fi worked well; in addition, I am a smoker and, even if Laura is allergic, she was so kind to set a nice smoking area in the yard for me. <br/>The house is well located, in a very calm neighborhood, and close to a couple of bus stops, the grocery, the public library, several restaurants and the park. Only the laundry is a little far (maybe 15-20 minutes by walk), but Laura has always been happy to give me a ride!<br/>In fact, the best part of my stay was Laura! She is one of the kindest persons I have ever met: always ready to help me with everything, to fix any problem that could arise and to make my stay as comfortable as possible. She even brought me out for lunch during my birthday, a few days after my arrival!<br/>And, above all, I enjoyed our conversations: we were both very busy, but, when we had some time to spare, we had some very interesting talks about... everything! I think that her personality, plus her great experience as a traveler, make her so an openminded person that she could drive a conversation whatever the topic is!<br/>Summing up, I know I will come back in LA in a couple of years... and I really hope that on of Laura's rooms will be available for me!"
185536,316669552,2018-08-31,67379043,Alina,"I liked the area, very safe and quite. Dogs are awesome, Laura is very friendly and kind woman. Thank you for everything :)"
185536,354111609,2018-11-30,5051641,Monika,"I stayed at Laura’s house for two and a half months. Laura is a very warm and welcoming person; however, the accommodation situation was not exactly what I expected it to be with regard to the hygienic situation in the kitchen and the bathroom. <br/>The house is located in a nice, safe and calm residential area in the west of L.A. It is near to shops for all daily needs, near to LAX, to the beach and to Loyola Marymount University. There are busses running to Venice, Santa Monica and Downtown L.A. Laura is very welcoming and friendly. She often gave me a ride to nearby directions, such as the laundry and the airport, which is very helpful as it is sometimes a bit difficult to get around in L.A. without a car.<br/>Your room: The room is quite big, nicely decorated and there are enough shelves and chests of drawers to stow all your clothes and stuff. The bed is comfortable and there is also a desk for eating and working. You even have your own fridge in the room, which is very practical. <br/>The kitchen: You can use the kitchen at any time of the day and Laura provides a solid choice of kitchen devices and utensils for her guests. However, for me the hygienic situation in the kitchen was difficult. There is always a lot of stuff on the work surfaces like used plastic bags, dog food, groceries and vegetable waste waiting for compost. In the sink there is often a pile of dirty dishes waiting to be cleaned. I would have preferred a cleaner place for cooking.<br/>The bathroom: The bathroom is shared by three people, but I never had to wait for it to be free as everybody cared about not spending too much time there. Like in the kitchen, the hygienic situation in the bathroom was difficult for me. As Laura does not use the bathroom, she does not care about cleaning it. The guests are supposed to clean it, but there is no schedule. During my stay, I rarely saw another guest cleaning the bathroom and I ended up cleaning it myself.<br/>Given my experience, I would not choose to stay at the place for such a long time again. The accommodation might be good for a shorter stay, but especially the hygienic conditions became difficult for me as I stayed longer. I am sorry to write this because Laura is a very nice person. However, I want to give an honest review for possible future guests so that they better know what to expect…"
185536,635562139,2020-07-06,339452635,Arya,"Cancelled reservation early because house was quite smelly and cluttered. <br/><br/>Laura was a kind host and accommodated my needs. She has lots of storage for your belongings and parking spots available.<br/><br/>However, I was not aware that the host would be sleeping on the couch and that her dogs would be living indoors. The pictures of the living room and kitchen are not up to date, as it is currently much more cluttered. She also keeps some of her belongings under the bed and in some of the drawers. The bedroom was not cleaned prior to arrival, but she has vacuum cleaners available to you.  <br/><br/>The house is very beautiful and in a prime location, however it must be cleaned thoroughly before I would recommend."
185536,713495683,2020-12-05,325039109,Daryl,"Laura is kind, thoughtful, and hospitable. The house is in a nice area, very quiet, close to amenities, and relatively close to the beach. I was comfortable during my 2-month stay and I would recommend others to stay here as well!"
185536,566003551605243289,2022-02-19,436519389,Renee,"Laura is a nice person, I enjoyed staying there for a month with her dogs. However, Laura has some strict rules regarding her house and they may not be for everyone. The room was nice and spacious enough."
51307,258179,2011-05-10,463955,Lynette,"David is a great host. The apartment was pretty much ideal for our needs as we could walk to relations house.
<br/>It had everything..
<br/>
<br/>Thanks David."
51307,276530,2011-05-23,318741,Elizabeth,This little apartment is very cute and well appointed. Everything you need is walking distance  and the endless hotel water in the place was a real treat. Highly recommended.

<br/>"
51307,299895,2011-06-06,546417,Ken,Great location.  Great neighborhood.  Very relaxing!!
51307,310228,2011-06-12,649130,Irina,David was great! he responded to my request very quickly and he was very accomodating. the house was so wonderful!  we had a nice dinner outside in the backyard and everything we needed was already in the kitchen ;)  david had all kinds of useful info about the area and places we could tour around town. the area was quiet and parking was easy. i would for sure stay here again! this house is lovely and wonderful. would recommend a stay her for EVERYONE ;)
51307,315895,2011-06-15,547939,Therese,The Spanish Bungalow Guest House was a fabulous place to stay. It had everything we needed and more. Great location. David was very friendly and made us feel welcome immediately. Lots of great tips about the area - and a real gentleman -- noticed our Smart Car with canadian plates when we were on the highway approaching his place - and gave us the personal escort! Excellent experience with airbnb - will definitely continue to use the services provided through this site.
51307,346266,2011-07-01,691851,Fly,Cute place. David is a sweet person and the neighborhood is quiet clean and hip.

51307,394788,2011-07-25,653529,Laura,"Cozy and cute bungalow in a nice, quiet neighborhood, accessible to lots of great LA spots. David is a great host. The house is small but adorable and has everything you need for a great stay."
51307,431961,2011-08-09,787606,Laura,"This is our first time using Airbnb. We had the best time! David's little bunglow is adorable and close to everything! The neighborhood is very nice and quiet. Even though we have family that live in LA and could stay somewhere for free, I would rather come back and stay here! It is the perfect little getaway. :)"
51307,441967,2011-08-13,603832,Michele,Really cute place; great location! David was really nice.
51307,491967,2011-09-01,422712,Joaquin,This place was perfect for a couple or just one person. I had the best time for two weeks. David was really helpful and gave us what we needed and answered all my questions. Great stay and great host
51307,520805,2011-09-11,705146,Kobi,"David is a very nice guy.
<br/>The apartment is very nice and clean
<br/>The location was excellent"

51307,549607,2011-09-20,795435,Megan,"My husband I visited LA for a few days and stayed at David's Bungalow; this was my first experience using AirNB.  David was an excellent communicator and very easy to email and reach by phone.  The Bungalow's location was ideal and the neighborhood a perfect option for those not wanting to stay downtown.  Parking our rental car was a breeze and we walked to neighborhood breakfast spots on the days we were there.  The Bungalow accommodations were between a hostel and hotel: not high comfort but, not minimal either."
51307,596523,2011-10-04,878167,Rolando,"David's guest house truly felt like a home away from home. It's charming, and nestled in a serene neighborhood. It's located in an incredibly convenient location, minutes from the 5, Los Feliz and Hollywood. 
<br/>
<br/>David does a great job of communicating and is very pleasant and helpful. Recommend a stay here to all."
51307,636301,2011-10-17,1101748,Charles,"Great place to stay in Atwater Village! Looks just like the pictures. You can walk to several places for coffee, drinks or food. Parking is ample. Quiet street, except for an occasional dog or two. Very close to Griffith park. Really enjoyed staying here. David was a very kind and accommodating host who will provide plenty of information."
51307,697429,2011-11-07,955942,Rebekah,"This was the perfect location for us, and a really great host! Thanks David, we had a blast :)"
51307,713741,2011-11-13,517356,Mike,"The Spanish Bungalow was a great value!  It has all the basic necessities to feel comfortable, including a very nice/modern kitchen area.  Being so close to the 5 was awesome as you feel like you can be anywhere in the city within 15 minutes.  It's also so nice to be near Griffith Park.  David was very accommodating -- coming out to meet me with the key at 11:30 pm due to my flight arriving so late in the evening was tremendous."
51307,757364,2011-12-01,183942,Jessica,We loved staying at David's little guest house. It's a quaint and cozy place!
51307,764825,2011-12-05,1129270,Sujata,"A lovely home and get-a-away.  David has sweetly appointed the space, and we felt very much at home.  A great, central location when in LA.  When we're back in town, we'll definitely plan to stay here again!"
2708,284617908,2018-07-01,93292025,Harjinder,Wow; Charles was a delight to meet a very warm and friendly man whom made me feel comfortable and at ease throughout my stay. Truly someone I will remember for his warmth and generosity. The apartment was homley and the location was perfect for anyone whom is looking for central proximity. I strongly recomend this place as your 1st choice.
2708,291375787,2018-07-15,183639942,Taylor,Chas. has a great space ! Loved how clean everything was and how available he was to help out with anything I needed!
2708,296879491,2018-07-26,37846734,John,"Chas is a great host, very friendly and welcoming (and informative!).  He keeps his place spotless and quiet, so this is a great location for people looking to relax or reset from a day out in Los Angeles.  The location is amazing and walkable to many stores and restaurants.  I especially enjoyed the in-building sauna and spa as a way to unwind at the end of the day.   In addition, the underground, secured parking is a great find (especially in the summer heat).  I'll definitely stay here next time I'm in the area."
2708,306500549,2018-08-12,48408491,Andrew,"Charles place is lovely and in a great location. Very central and close to things nearby. The small private gym and sauna are a great little touch I used a lot. The bed was big and really comfortable and Charles is an accommodating, friendly and informative host. Great find"
2708,319965969,2018-09-07,51146446,Stephanie,Charles's place is great! It is very clean and centrally located. He also goes out of his way to make sure that you enjoy your stay.
2708,358265929,2018-12-13,118296038,Aziz Ibrahim,"Charles place will not disappoint for a second, it has all necessities needed to have a comfortable stay. As a person that is sensitive to dust,  I really appreciated that the apartment is clean and has good ventilation. The location of the apartment is incredible you really are a split second from alot of happenings. I really enjoyed my stay and I hope to be back very soon. On top of the great apartment, Charles as a host is truly an unicorn. Very good at communication, understanding the needs of the guest and making sure the stay is comfortable. Truly an unique experience!"
2708,417933068,2019-02-28,153706631,Andrea,"Chas is an amazing host and I absolutely recommend his place. It's very clean, you have enough privacy and the location is great too, as there is everything like restaurants, grocery and metro station in walking distance. I had an awesome time there and really enjoyed my stay!"
2708,425630420,2019-03-18,13903098,Tami,"Chas. is an excellent host, and this is a great location and a great space. Chas. was very accommodating even when my flight was delayed, and he was always willing to go the extra mile to make sure that I was happy with everything about my stay. This is a great location even if you do not have a car, since public transportation is plentiful in this area and there are also a lot of restaurants and shops in easy walking distance, but Chas. also made it easy for me to park my car in his building. All in all, this was a great stay, and I highly recommend it."
2708,443320279,2019-04-25,228846650,Stefanie,"I had an amazing time at Charles place. He made me feel very welcome and comfortable.

2708,452259654,2019-05-12,141434769,Matthew,"As you might have gleaned from the other reviews, Chas was amazing. A gracious and warm welcome was followed by a sparkling clean appartment. There was a mutual respect between everyone and there was a relaxing sense of silence and peace in the space."
2708,456137752,2019-05-20,249489563,Morgan,"I had a great time at Charles place, he is a great host in every possible way. The room (and the common areas)<br/>is cozy, nice and clean. The bed is very comfortable, there is a desk and plenty of space for storage should you need it.<br/>This place has everything you're likely to need on your travels, highly recommended!"
2708,501551096,2019-08-03,249142508,Steven,Great place and great location. Charles is very friendly and very accommodating.
2708,521262231,2019-08-31,32253750,Adrian,"Chas place is a gem, conveniently located to shops , grocery stores, night life entertainment and more. Easy to get around as everything is close by.   <br/>In addition his place is as described and even better; very serene, neat, and most especially comfortable. <br/>Chas is a warm and welcoming host , and ensures the place is always kept clean as much as possible.  Highly recommend to anyone visiting Los Angeles."
2708,576181646,2019-12-12,79475501,Jenny,"Wonderful hospitality, strongly recommend!"
2708,619302203,2020-03-17,117823684,Nathan,"Location is decent (near some great music stores, restaurants, and a lot of other things to do). The room itself is decent. I didn't know that the room wouldn't offer any blockage from sounds in the living room, because it didn't have a closed wall. The bed stank of body odor before I got there, so I had to Febreeze the bed multiple times over to make it usable, but there was a Febreeze bottle available. <br/><br/>There were a few days that I had to be sure to be out of the room, because the owner was having work done on the door that was attached to my room. It was an unforeseen inconvenience, but he made up for it by giving me $10 for lunch.<br/>One one of those days that I was waiting for the workers in the room, I happened to be outside the main door and the building owner came by and told me that there were to be absolutely no AirBnB guests in the building. That, of course, freaked me out. I told the owner of the room of what just happened and he told me that rule only applied to short term stays, not long term guests. So that was resolved.<br/><br/>In case of a pandemic (like the COVID-19) be aware that your money won't be returned, even after a personal discussion with the owner about the current issues and the necessity to return home early. Not even a week after I returned home, LA put just about everything on lockdown and there was a high chance that I wouldn't have been able to return home at all if I stayed for the original plan. The owner and I spoke about it and he agreed to give me a refund and I offered to give him some money in return for all the trouble that it caused. A week later, I received a message from AirBnB, saying that he decided not to return anything at all  to me in the midst of the pandemic and in spite of our discussion and my perceived mutual understanding. <br/><br/>Because of his policy, he is within his rights to keep the money. I had only hoped that our verbal agreement would've been honored."
51307,781547,2011-12-12,1476431,Lucas,"We spend 3 days there.
<br/>House is nice and cozy.
<br/>David is a nice guy. 
<br/>I recommend to anyone that is going to LA to stay in his place.
<br/>Very convenient.

<br/>"
51307,828753,2012-01-03,1105637,Teresa,"My husband and I booked the bungalow for part of our honeymoon, we booked it for 9 days total. My first impression was positive, the neighborhood was very nice and quite with easy access to the freeway. David was also very nice, he waited for us to arrive to make sure we got in okay.  
<br/>Everything in the bungalow was like the pictures, but what my husband and I weren't happy about was the smell. It has a very strong animal odor and the house was poorly cleaned. The mattress was old and very uncomfortable so we didn't sleep very well. 
<br/>"
51307,1233113,2012-05-06,1710288,Gary,"For my wife and I  a great location as our daughter lives 4 blocks away so we were able to walk over every morning so see our new grand daughter.
<br/>You could go two blocks down and eat at the village bakery or play golf at a par 3 course; walk the in the other direction you have a Starbucks, a great wine store and a links and beer place with over 20 beers on tap. Close to drug stores,gas ,dry cleaning etc.  If our daughter is still at this location we will be renting again.
<br/>G.Parker"
51307,1267803,2012-05-12,2198328,Angel,"Beautiful, safe neighborhood down the road from Los Feliz restaurants/bars/Griffith Park. Excellent choice if you plan on staying on the east side. Not as desirable if you want beaches everyday. 
<br/>
<br/>The I-5 entrance is only a few blocks away and about a 5-7 minute drive to downtown (assuming there is no traffic).  
<br/>
<br/>Don't feel like going anywhere, the local neighborhood has some cute restaurants, coffeeshops/bakeries & cool dive bars."
51307,1382548,2012-05-30,306787,Marie & Peter,"David's space is perfect. Everything you might need is available; well-stocked spice cabinet with condiments, coffee and teas. Outdoor space delightful, fabulous neighbors and neighborhood - walk to LA River walk/bike path. Walk to shops on Los Feliz. Easy on/off 5 freeway. Comfortable furnishings. Great price!"

<br/>Looking forward to visiting again!"
51307,2439253,2012-09-28,786142,Carter,This was the first of many trips my wife will be taking with me now that our kids are freed and I wanted it to be a nice experience. David's place was perfect. There is plenty in walking distance to do and the accommodations are quite comfortable for two. Would certainly recommend.
51307,2657206,2012-10-19,1699336,Carmel,"A totally charming place in a lovely quiet neighborhood a stone's throw from Silverlake.  The kitchen was well-equipped, the decor was stylishly vintage and David was a very amiable host.  Only one wish.....internet.
<br/>Other than that, it was perfect.  I'll definitely stay again!"
51307,2767078,2012-10-30,3960112,Mai,The place was very nice and exactly as advertised. David was very friendly and helpful.

51307,6594721,2013-08-18,7692259,Ashley,"Delightful home-away-from-home and host. Complete apartment (LR, DR, kitchen, bathroom, and BR) with air conditioner in BR for nights when LA heat was just too much. Completely comfortable, a 1/2 mile walk from Glendale Blvd, and a 1 mile walk from the folks I was visiting just north of Silver Lake Blvd. Very clean and the bed was comfy. Trying to think of something to complain about, I can only come up with too many decorative pillows on the bed that I had to pile on the floor every night!"
51307,6923917,2013-08-30,3658759,Firas,Everything was very good. Cool house - nice area!!!
51307,7398074,2013-09-18,8266574,Ann,The apartment was very charming in a quiet neighborhood. Great location and convenient parking in front of the home. David was a great host. We enjoyed our visit and time in California - looking forward to coming back.
51307,7760562,2013-10-01,8988774,Simha,We stayed 1 week at the apartment. Worked out great for us. Location was perfect and the apartment had everything we needed. There was a problem of cellular receiving and without wifi we felt a bit disconnected.
51307,8530254,2013-11-04,6228570,Ashley,"Our stay here was wonderful. The location is great, just off the 5 fwy and there is lots of street parking.

She is so helpful, picking me up at the airport, taking me to my school and even inviting me to a Shakespeare show on the first day! And the house is cute with quiet neighborhood and the location is convenient, also all bathroom toiletries are supplied. Thanks Laura for offering me a great place to stay on my first arrival of US and I will definitely come back if needed."
2708,632352136,2020-06-26,275399037,Tom,Charles was not only a gracious and accommodating host but he’s also full of insight and really cares about his guests.<br/><br/>He is an outstanding resource so use him!<br/><br/>The best way to get the most out of your experience with him is to talk to him and really understand he has the best intention for you!<br/><br/>I would recommend Charles to anyone new to the LA area and really do consider him a friend!
185557,69212578,2016-04-10,56757681,Lucy,"Laura was amazing. She was eager to meet up beforehand, and took the time to make sure that my stay was comfortable and exactly what I wanted. The area is beautiful and quiet, and walking distance to pretty much anything you need (including a great library). It's a wonderful place, and she is very helpful."
185557,90114315,2016-07-31,54454044,Fern,"Laura has a comfortable, clean home with a convenient location but it is her warm gracious spirit that makes for a 5 star air b&b. Enthusiastic thumbs up!"
185557,155710043,2017-05-28,26912245,Mary,I stayed here for 3 months while going through an intense program. I always felt safe and comfortable. Laura has a warm welcoming personality! Her doggies are wonderful as well.

185557,744740945,2021-04-02,63383391,Theresse,"Stayed a month at Laura's home, and it was the perfect place to get acquainted with Los Angeles. Was close enough to the beach that I could walk there and is located in a quiet and nice town that has a lots of trails and beautiful views. Laura was very hospitable and made my stay very enjoyable!"
185557,485587674554861699,2021-10-31,414558258,Lily,"Laura is a very welcoming host who wants to make sure your needs are met. House is also in a prime location of Los Angeles for someone who is new to the area. Close to the beach, LAX, lots of shops, and parks."
51307,10978506,2014-03-16,1836899,Laura,"David was a lovely guy met him at the beginning and end of my booking.  I highly recommend David's place it's in a great spot in atwater village, walking distance to great places and on a beautiful street."
51307,11114018,2014-03-21,191564,Myleen,Very charming space and great location. Perfect space for 2 people. The lack of wi-fi wasn't missed since we spent most of our time out and about. Lot's of great options within walking distance. Would definitely stay here again.
51307,11384664,2014-03-31,3943056,Katie,David was super accommodating. He met me at the location and handed off the keys. Everything was exactly as described. It was such a lovely neighborhood too. One of the best in LA in my opinion. I would totally stay at David's again and probably will next time I'm in LA.
51307,11500832,2014-04-05,13682426,Samantha,"Great little place, lots of space, cute decor.  Everything was clean and there was plenty of pots, pans, and coffee making devices.  The location is excellent and the neighborhood is quiet.  There's a Trader Joe's right down the street for quick groceries.  I would recommend this spot to anyone staying in L.A.  David was a wonderful host with plenty of information."
51307,12635973,2014-05-06,14487457,Katie,"David was great, very nice and friendly. The space was exactly as described and reasonably priced. Great location, near freeways, walking distance from plenty of eateries, stores and pubs with tons of nearby activities. Wonderful neighborhood, everyone was very friendly. Bed was nice and comfy with lots of pillows. There was an AC unit in the bedroom, but the rest of the house was a bit hot, no central air. Given that I am from UT and not used to the warm weather (99 degrees) it may have just been me. There was a portable fan provided which certainly helped. Overall I enjoyed my stay very much and would definitely stay again! I will (and already have) recommended the house to others."
51307,13154693,2014-05-20,14854967,Reggie,Had my mother and grandmother visiting from out of town. I guess this rental was meant to be as David had full accommodations for elderly individuals. Loved the furnishings of the apartment and sitting on the porch with a view of Griffith Park. David was a pleasure to work with and was in constant communication with any arrangements that had to be made. David made my first airbnb experience a pleasurable one.
51307,14736414,2014-06-25,14583747,Victoria,The location was suitable for our needs. We have family in the area and were out all day everyday. The building is quaint and classic Atwater Village. There's plenty of space for two. The problem for us is that it heated to an unbearable degree during the day because we had no way to adequately ventilate it. We would rent it again for a winter vacation. June is just too hot for this garage apartment.
51307,16061743,2014-07-21,14609911,Matthew,"David was a very good host,"
51307,16782511,2014-08-02,17051124,Jenae,Great host and cozy bungalow! Would definitely visit again. Very nice neighborhood. My partner and I were able to go for runs outside the majority of our stay.
51307,17125802,2014-08-07,11055950,Sarah,"Be careful because you owe more money AFTER YOU ARRIVE.  He requires you to pay the 14% occupancy tax after arrival (this is hidden somewhere in the description of the location, but certainly isn't apparent.  When you arrive, he asks for too much personal information (afraid of identity theft anyone???).  Also, more obvious in the description, but good to remember that there is no WiFi or television at this spot.  And it's really hot everywhere except the bedroom."
51307,18188515,2014-08-23,18803491,Sarah,"We greatly enjoyed our stay - excellent location, nice space, and a friendly host!"
51307,18435463,2014-08-26,1409688,Wesley,"David was a great host, he was flexible with our check in time and went through the whole place with us.  The apartment was very nice, a little warm during the day but cooled down readily with all windows open at night.  The neighborhood is really nice and parking is readily available for free.  You can walk to a nice bakery for breakfast.  We would definitely recommend d this place."
51307,28760043,2015-03-29,29867692,Elaine,"David was wonderful, extremely helpful with driving recommendations and local info. I was disappointed that he did not live on site as I would have loved to have spent time with him! He was always quick to respond to my texts.  That was really nice when I had a question. He was very accommodating when we ended up arriving much later than expected.  Even made him late to an engagement and he didn't even rush us! Gave us a tour of the apt, history of the area and went over everything. We felt very welcomed.
<br/>
<br/>The neighborhood was amazing - very safe & clean - and beautiful. The apt was VERY clean. I was able to walk barefoot around the house! The 20's feel of the place was lovely. He has gone to great lengths to keep this styling.
<br/>
<br/>It did get warm during the day, but the evening and nights were cool. There is a floor fan for circulation and an air conditioner in the bedroom for sleeping. We opened the house up each evening and it was very comfortable. We used the air conditioner a couple nights as we were in a heat wave that weekend.
<br/>
<br/>Bed was too small for us, but it was very soft and my husband loved it! This is the ONLY thing that would keep me from returning. Since the couch is not designed for comfortable sleeping I had to endure sleeping in a ball on one side of the bed.
<br/>
<br/>Due to roosting birds we could not enjoy the front patio, be aware of their season if you plan to use the patio. I love that he cares enough about them to respect their area and not try to remove them. We do the same on our property at home.
<br/>
<br/>The couch and patio furniture need updating for comfort, and the TV really needs to be larger. Nothing to keep me away, however. I'm just spoiled in that area. And, a more comfortable couch would solve the small bed problem for me.
<br/>
<br/>The kitchen was very well appointed. I cooked every day and EVERYTHING I needed was there including a heat diffuser!  It's an antique gas stove so it was really nice to have that. I hand washed every morning, but there are enough utensils that you don't have to and a dishwasher. Very nice for long stays. There was a musty smell coming from under the sink. Probably just old house smell, but I plan to mention it to him in case he can fix that.  Only smelled it when opening that cupboard so I removed the garbage pail to the side so I didn't have to open it. Solved that issue.
<br/>
<br/>Our stay was very comfortable and David a wonderful ""host"". If you are required to come to the LA area it would be a perfect location to stay."

Super helpful, thoughtful and very kind. He will help you with any questions you have about LA and will give you great advice. 100% the best spot in Hollywood."

2708,388464514550605494,2021-06-19,130482838,Adam,"I had a good experience and Charles works very hard to keep the place immaculately clean. This was one of the cleanest homes I have ever spent any time in. The bed and the room are spacious, comfortable and elegant (in addition to being spotless). The wall separating this bedroom from the living room/kitchen area is of normal height, but does not reach all the way to the very high ceiling. This means that any sound travels clearly between the two areas. Charles is extremely quiet, as were the other guests (there is one other room rented out) so noise coming into my room was never bothersome. I felt self-conscious about making noise myself, however Charles never made me feel bad about making noise and even specifically said it wouldn’t bother him if I had a phone conversation at normal volume at 2am. The parking garage is very convenient. Charles made me a great cup of coffee and muffin on the first morning. The shower/bathroom were very clean and pleasant, as Charles checks on them multiple times a day. The location is within walking distance of Runyon Canyon, which is a very cool place to hike, and there are tons of food places within easy walking distance."

If you’re into small microwave & toaster oven meals this place is perfect but not If you’re cooking, cooking (seasoning meats, mixing, etc.) overall calm, cleanly stay"

Overall, I would stay again as it provides a calm, clean and quiet environment.  It was an extra plus to have access to a kitchen since I did stay for 30 days and I didn’t want to have to do takeout every night. Highly recommend.<br/><br/>Best, <br/>Mich"

187526,1551312,2012-06-24,2622635,Leigh,"This was my first airbnb experience and I will definitely do it again based on this positive experience with my hosts. Paul and Hyobee were such warm and gracious hosts and they seem to attract friendly guests as I had a chance to meet a few of them, too. 
<br/>
<br/>I felt bad because I arrived shortly before midnight after driving 7 hours and they acted like this was no problem to them (I did call several times along the way to let them know of my progress). They also accommodated my need to use a land line when my cellphone was getting poor reception and I needed to make a call.
<br/>
<br/>The short time I was able to spend with them (since I was attending a conference at Pepperdine) I was intrigued to learn more about their very interesting life experiences.  The huge foyer has probably 50 framed photos of the hosts with many former US presidents.  Hyobee's artwork is throughout the home; it is very colorful, high- texture representation of crosses, hearts and flowers. She has a lovely printed coffee table book of her artwork along with others' poetry.
<br/>
<br/>The bedroom and bathroom were simply decorated and very clean with the unexpected touch of fresh flowers, drinking glasses, bottled water and free wi-fi.
<br/>
<br/>I would love to return and stay again.
<br/>
<br/>This is a perfect location to visit Pepperdine. The college is only about 2.5 miles away."
187526,1668646,2012-07-09,2137678,Julia,"What a wonderful stay with Paul and Hyo Bee - the location is magical, the house is fantastic - just as it looks in the pictures - the bedroom was comfortable and spotlessly clean, and the hosts are incredibly gracious. They took a lot of trouble to welcome us and make us feel at home - we hung out by the pool in the afternoon, then brought seafood back to eat in the house that evening, and felt totally at home. We loved it here so much that we even skipped a trip to the Channel Islands in the morning, which was the reason we were in Malibu in the first place! I highly recommend staying here, and can't wait to come back, next time I'm in the area."
187526,1724185,2012-07-16,2806858,Chris,"Paul and Hyo are great hosts with a lovely house. They made us feel welcome and were willing to adjust to our arrival schedule. Next time we want to visit Malibu, we'll see if Paul has any open rooms."

51307,29361059,2015-04-06,30255136,Cameron,"I would give this bungalow the highest recommendation. It is perfect for a couple who can sleep in the bedroom and one more could possibly sleep in the living room for a +1. It is quite spacious and is stocked with everything that you might need during your stay. The bathroom is nicer than the pictures depict with a nice bath/shower. There is a small dining area with seating for 4 and a kitchen with most/all utensils you need.  The bungalow is located above a storage garage so you should not be disturbed by noise. I'm not sure if there is WIFI on this premise or not we were too busy enjoying ourselves to need such a utility.  David is nice and does not intrude whatsoever. Overall, a highly recommended stay in LA."

<br/>David was beyond accommodating - answering all my questions in a timely manner... and provided me with some excellent recommendations for places to visit/dine in the area. 
<br/>I will definitely stay here again! :-)"

It was quiet and private, as well, with a small patio area in back. The location is excellent, with restaurants, cafés, stores, etc. in walking distance, in either direction. The neighborhood is great for walking. Griffith Park is minutes away.

51307,62864727,2016-02-17,51453413,Tiffany,"As soon as we arrived, David was there to welcome us. We engaged in warm conversation about where we were from and also joked around about work and everyday life. He gave us a tour of the very charming Spanish Bungalow or what we referred to as the club house. 
<br/>
<br/>The pictures were absolutely accurate although you get a better view of the lemons and oranges up close and personal... you know, when you're climbing the trees picking them : )
<br/>
<br/>The neighborhood was so great. It was super neighbor--hoody. It was quiet, friendly neighbors, beautiful scenery, birds chirping... the works. 
<br/>
<br/>From David's humor to the park around the way to the best mattress i've ever slept on... this place is quite a dream!

<br/> We would definitely come back again and again."

51307,66500305,2016-03-22,7308833,Wren,"Great place, cute location, and since it's a Spanish bungalow style, it's very LA! David was easy to work with to meet for keys, gave clear instructions on how to use everything. The space is small but comfortable. Atwater Village is a very walkable, quiet neighborhood. Close to the 5 freeway and Griffith Park!"
51307,67025401,2016-03-26,17622090,Debora,"David was really nice and friendly. He was also flexible with out check in time. The listing was perfect and we knew exactly what we were getting. The house is lovely and in an amazing location. Really close to everywhere we wanted to go in LA. Really quiet neighborhood, easy parking. The only down side for us was the bed (smaller than queen size, but very comfy mattress) and no Wi-Fi. Still totally worth it. I'd book that again for sure!"
51307,68409555,2016-04-04,60660401,Martha Ann,"I loved this quaint bungalow. It was perfect in every way. I hated to leave and can't wait to return. I could walk to Los Feliz and there was a wonderful bakery cafe, a terrific burger pub and Los Feliz Cafe with great food and a fun view of the golf course. The neighborhood is adorable."

After a long day of exploring, this place was a cozy and comfortable little oasis to come home to.  We also enjoyed walking around the neighborhood and discovering the restaurants of Atwater Village.  The orange tree outside was the icing on the cake. I would recommend this listing to anyone who asked.  Thank you David."

51307,108848854,2016-10-17,94937255,Jakob,"David greeted us right on time at the house, and was very kind and outspoken. Really a good first impression. The house itself is perfect for two persons. Very romantic and idyllic. And the neighborhood seems safe, and makes one have a taste of how it is to live in suburban LA whilst being very close to the center (9 usd to Hollywood with an Uber). We really loved our stay. Thank you David."
51307,110197585,2016-10-24,48522986,Dave,"Host: First, let me start off by saying David was great at check-in. Our check-in process with him was pretty seamless. I appreciated that he was at the location, waiting for us when we arrived. He was very informative and gave us some advice and suggestions on how to make the most of our traveling arrangements. During our stay he was not too outreaching. However, he did reply when I contacted him once. FYI, he had me sign an ""tenant agreement"" form during check-in.<br/><br/>Pros: You'll have the entire place to yourself. It is small, cozy, and quaint, if you like that sort of thing. <br/><br/>Cons: A bit of a musty smell, as the place is a bit old. The towels and linen look a bit old and unkempt. The amenities are lacking (no waters, paper towels, toothpaste, the body washes and other bathroom amenities were almost empty, etc.) The appliances can use an upgrade (tv, dryer was broken, the microwave wasn't effective, etc.)<br/><br/>The neighborhood was nice and safe, but just a little too quiet for me, maybe because I'm from NY. (Just my personal opinion.)<br/><br/>Overall, our host was great at check-in and we enjoyed our stay in LA, but the listing didn't meet our expectations of what was advertised."
51307,133454366,2017-02-22,1554509,Simon,David's place was perfect for our week in LA. The cottage is cute and cosy and in a very quiet neighbourhood. Local restaurants and coffee shops are only a 5 minute walk and bus stops and a train station are really close by so getting to central LA is not a problem. There isn't any internet in the house which I thought would be a problem but it was the perfect excuse to go to the Village Bakery every morning and check emails so it was never an inconvenience. David was really communicative and quick to respond to check in requests so arrival was nice and easy. This will definitely be my first choice when I come back to LA.
51307,134538786,2017-02-27,6431702,Yenisbel,This place was amazing. Cute and clean and very convenient. Would definitely stay here again

No wifi and the air conditioner unit in the room is small but good enough to cool off the bedroom. Overall, this is a great find and the location is perfect for getting around town quickly! Definitely checkout the neighborhood and local restaurants!"
51307,142337000,2017-04-07,50468426,Stephanie,"David's guest house was perfect for our three days in LA.  Check-in was easy and David is very friendly.  The house is in a quiet, residential neighborhood and is extremely well located (close to Proof Bakery for delicious croissants!)  As other reviewers have said, there is a bit of an old house/musty smell and there is no wifi which might be a problem for business travelers.  But, if you're coming to LA to explore, it's a great value in a great location."
